positive,Activities implemented in frame of the project have carefully addressed issues for people with  disabilities such as infrastructure facilities for them. ,78
positive,Lately ADISA has designed a video- material targeting blind people aiming to explain the services offered by ADISA- thus  contributing at the inclusiveness of this group as beneficiary of the public services too. ,79

positive,The project’s approach based on inclusiveness and participatory  manner is one of the added value for the successful implementation.,92
positive,The project contribution  was greatest in increased government capacities on public service delivery topic as one of the  most important pillars of the public administration reform in Albania. ,93
positive,UNDP has built a sound monitoring and evaluation plan  which has contributed to the assessment of the progress at result level and phasing out strategies. ,94
positive,Bold joint synergy with UNDP project STAR II was put in place which produced concrete  results at approaching public services of the central government at local level.,95

positive,The credibility of the project is widely perceived and accepted as a model or inspiration of  positive approach and improved trust in the state institutions at central and local level.,97
positive,Innovative  approaches are a great contribution too. ,98
positive,"Given the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, a  reasonable job was done. ",99

positive,"Progress reporting was realistic, timely, and shared with all the  stakeholders. ",108
positive,CCAP delivered well in reducing vulnerability of women and men but had  moderate success in building adaptive capacity. ,109
positive,The project was completed in time given that extension time was  required to spend additional funds.,110
positive,Quality of many outputs is  satisfactory.,111
positive,Outputs targets were completed within budget. ,112
positive,CCAP successfully catalyzed the CCA agenda in the country and resulted  in more funding from GEF. ,113

positive,"Overall target  achievement is good, as several targets were exceeded.",126
positive,Outputs have been achieved within cost.,127
positive,"he quality of several  outputs, cost is justified. ",128
positive,"Exchange rate gain was mostly offset by higher  inflation, keeping the purchasing power of the project almost constant. ",129
positive,"Project investment are of good quality, which are likely to sustain benefits for  several years. ",130
positive,Project investments do not pose any significant environmental threat. ,131
positive,Vulnerability is reduced by improving  incomes and reducing economic losses. ,132
positive,"Some plantations, rangeland rehabilitation, and reduction in soil  degradation due to productive infrastructure is likely to bring some  “Minimal” improvements to environmental status. ",133
positive,Strengthening of  adaptive capacity is likely to show progress towards stress/status change  over time.,134
positive,Vulnerability reduction may indirectly reduce stress on the  environment.,135
positive,The project has largely succeeded in meeting its objective.,136
positive,"Importance of  climate change has been catalyzed, livelihoods of target rural households  have improved, exposure to climate induced disasters has reduced, women  have been empowered. ",137
positive,Climate change integration has seen modest  improvements. ,138

positive,"Quality of project investments is generally good, which are likely to sustain benefits for several  years.",143
positive,"Several interventions such as food processing centers, solar dryers, raisin drying rooms, honey  bee-keeping were designed to benefit women, which resulted in increase in their incomes. ",144
positive,Women were socially organized to support each other.,145
positive,Communities and districts giving greater  role to women were rewarded. ,146
positive,The was  demonstrated in terms of varied and extensive achievements covering all levels and types of  stakeholders in all countries.,147
positive,"The combining of respectively donor, government and private  resource allocation – the latter mainly from beneficiaries and contributed in kind, proved  feasible and is viewed as being the main course for the rapid and substantial achievement at  output level.",148
positive,The reported output achievements justify a full testing of the SMU principles to allow for  possible achievements at impact level thus also proving the likely sustainability.,149
positive,"The evaluation finds that the project was relevant to the strategic objectives of the governments of the  three countries, to the approaches adopted at regional level by both SADC and the African Union, to the  ambitions of the ILO in encouraging countries to work towards the establishment of social protection  floors, to the orientation of other development partners, and – in the main – to Irish Aid policy, although it  is worth mentioning that the scope of social protection encompassed by the project is considerably broader  than the definition included in Irish Aid’s forthcoming Social Protection Strategy.",150
positive,"The validity of the design of the project was endorsed by the mid-term evaluation, and is not revisited in  detail in this final report. ",151
positive,"But this lesson  appears to have been learnt (after being raised in the mid-term evaluation), through better consultation  during the design of the next phase of the project",152
positive,"Gender and HIV/AIDS issues were properly addressed in  the project design (and in subsequent interventions); and there was good consultation with tripartite  constituents (governments, employers and worker representatives) both before and during the project.",153
positive,"In terms of effectiveness, the project has been remarkably successful in meeting its expected outputs and  outcomes. ",154
positive,It fully achieved all of the outputs under its first two outcomes. ,155
positive,"Of the regional outcomes, by far the most significant output was  the suite of regional training modules, and these have duly been completed, albeit late in the life of the  project.",156
positive,Overall the project team are to be congratulated on delivering a highly effective intervention. ,157
positive,"Given the relatively limited resources at their disposal (both human and financial), they have punched well  above their weight in a crowded field.",158
positive,"The direct provision of technical assistance through in-house staff is  one of the unique characteristics of the ILO team, despite being occasionally challenged by donors as it  implies a larger share of the budget going to staff costs, rather than activities. ",159
positive,"All the stakeholders  interviewed during the evaluation, without exception, were extremely positive about the reactivity of the  project staff and the quality of their technical inputs.",160
positive,"Particularly appreciated were the responsiveness, the  technical competence, the broad range of expertise, and the fact that the staff worked directly with  counterpart staff, thus raising their capacity at the same time as delivering high-quality inputs.",161
positive,The efficiency of resource use was high.,162
positive,"Despite comparatively limited resources, the project has identified  and nimbly exploited a number of strategic opportunities which have allowed it to have an impact greater  than its scale would normally warrant.",163
positive,"By involving itself at policy level, it has been able to influence senior  officials in key government positions, at the same time as encouraging commitment from development  partners and mobilising support from other stakeholders such as civil society, the media, academia and  parliamentarians.",164
positive,"The project was also very judicious in choosing to coordinate high-visibility events, such  as the social protection weeks in Mozambique and Zambia. ",165
positive,"To have genuinely moved the debate towards a  greater acceptance of social protection floors in all of the three countries where it operated, and in the  space of only three years, is a significant achievement for a project with just a handful of staff and a  financial envelope of below USD1.5 million.",166
positive,Not all teams would have been able to emulate the impacts  that this one achieved with comparatively scant resources.,167
positive,"That they did is a reflection of their ability to  identify potentially influential openings, to encourage effective partnerships and to leverage  complementary resources to augment their own.",168
positive,This combination translates into high cost-effectiveness for the project. ,169
positive,"The fact that, in spite of  this, it has attained the vast majority of its outcomes is clear evidence of this. ",170
positive,"In addition to its own  strategically judicious activities, it has been highly effective as a catalyst to build partnerships, mobilise  resources and leverage collaboration with others. ",171
positive,"Example of this include Malawi, where the project  contributed to mobilizing additional funding of USD335,000 through ILO’s regular budget; and Zambia and  Mozambique, where the project supported the development of nationally-funded UN joint programs,  which now represent the main source of funding for ILO’s work in country.",172
positive,"Yet it was able to mobilise an impressive range of partners, and to elicit contributions worth a  further USD150,000 from different ILO sources and other collaborators. ",173
positive,"It has also been flexible and  responsive in its approach, putting its resources into activities that it felt would pay the greatest dividends.",174
positive,"The project has successfully influenced the particular stage at which each country finds itself in  the broad direction of a social protection floor: the review process of the Malawi National Social Support  Programme (MNSSP) (including a series of thirteen stakeholder workshops); the similar evaluation of the  National Basic Social Protection Strategy (ENSSB) and design of the new ENSSB 2019-2024 in Mozambique;  and the comprehensive mapping, modelling and analysis that underpinned the development of the  integrated framework for non-contributory social protection programmes in Zambia. ",175
positive,"The project, even while the modules have been under preparation, has already begun the process of ensuring  this. ",176
positive,The design process has been very inclusive of potential partners who have the ability to take the  modules forward independently of project support.,177
positive,"And, as well as being innovative in their  transformational approach, the training modules are also innovative in that the project wants to  institutionalize them with other partners, to ensure their sustainability beyond the life even of the next  phase of the project.",178
positive,"In terms of impact, the project can claim an impressive record in opening up the debates around social  protection to a more integrated, more rights-based and more universal, approach, that is fully consistent  with ILO’s values and vision.",179
positive,"The gradual establishment of social protection floors in the three countries is  likely to bear fruit over the longer term in reducing poverty, building resilience and improving the quality of  employment.",180
positive,The project resulted in ILO moving from having practically no social protection  presence in the country to having a key leadership role in the process and the output from the  wide-ranging review of the MNSSP. ,181
positive,"Despite the challenging environment, this process has demonstrably initiated debate about expanding social protection coverage, adopting more  categorical targeting, better integrating the different components, stronger coordination and more  coherent linkages between social support and other sectors (e.g. humanitarian response,  agriculture and livelihoods).",182
positive,"In Mozambique, largely as a result of the project, ILO is seen as a partner of choice, but working  with many other influential stakeholders. ",183
positive,"Similarly, in Zambia, the development of the integrated framework, and the associated modelling  of costs and benefits of different approaches has resulted in much more open discussions about  the way forward: the targeting of the social cash transfer is already more categorical than it was,  and there is a clear recognition that support to children represents an important gap in current  coverage that needs to be filled.",184
positive,"The project has helped to cement a rapprochement between the  social cash transfer and ILO’s engagement with the Ministry of Labour, thus shaping a more  integrated social protection agenda with simpler, yet broader, targeting.",185
positive,"These are all important national outcomes, resulting at least partly from the activities of the project.",186
positive,"They  reflect the fact that ILO broadens the space for social protection debate, bringing in different players apart  from ministries of social welfare, and adding a dimension on contributory social protection, in the form of  maternity benefits, pension reform, health protection, financing and systemic issues.",187
positive,"The project has significantly supported evidence-based national debate through the many studies it has undertaken on the  extension of social protection coverage, particularly to the informal economy.",188
positive,"It is premature to assess the project’s impacts at regional level empirically, but the indications are positive. ",189
positive,It concentrated its regional focus on the development of the suite of social protection training modules. ,190
positive,"But if the next phase of the project can achieve this, then the regional  component too will be adjudged a success.",191
positive,"In terms of project design, it is recommended that Irish Aid national staff are fully consulted during  the design phase of future projects (which, encouragingly, seems already to be the case with the  next phase of this project), as are ILO’s tripartite constituents.",192
positive,"Where project implementation is concerned, the main lesson, and a powerful example of best  practice for both ILO and Irish Aid, is that small, agile regional projects operating at policy level can  have genuine influence on attitudes within government, and can accelerate the move towards  social protection floors.",193
positive,"In conclusion, Irish Aid, ILO, and the project staff all deserve credit for having respectively funded,  conceived and implemented an ambitious project. ",194
positive,"It has genuinely advanced the cause of social protection  floors in the three countries it covered, an achievement which was by no means assured at the outset.",195
positive,"It  has not done this by itself of course, but through judicious partnership with other key stakeholders,  through strategic prioritisation of the processes and activities it supported, and through the suppleness of  its response.",196
positive,"As a result, Irish Aid is playing a much more prominent policy role than it was; ILO is no longer  seen as a radically universalist outsider, but as a central player in balanced debates; and the three partner  countries have gained the confidence to assume a critical role in deciding if what is proposed to them fits  with their now well-articulated strategies.",197
positive,The LEED project responded to the need to rebuild livelihoods in the  Northern Province in the aftermath of the 26-year civil war which ended in May 2009.,198
positive,"The key  innovation introduced by LEED was to employ a market-driven approach to livelihood development, linking northern primary producers with southern Sri Lankan export and domestic markets.",199
positive,"Recognizing the need to extend and scale-up the effort, EGLR focuses on strengthening livelihoods in the  fruit and vegetables and fishery sectors, targeting vulnerable communities and extending the  geographical coverage to new districts. ",200
positive,"Strategically, EGLR continues to address the north-south  development gap and the perception of inequality between the two main communities that was at the  heart of the protracted conflict. ",201
positive,"With poverty still widespread in the Northern Province, EGLR continued to be relevant to community  needs for sustainable livelihood development.",202
positive,The expansion to Jaffna and Mannar districts reached  more communities who suffered damage to their livelihoods in the aftermath of the conflict and who  have not previously been supported through a market-driven approach. ,203
positive,"The cooperatives and their members found the support to production inputs, training to improve  production and cooperative organization and links to southern markets highly relevant to their needs. ",204
positive,"From the perspective of international and local exporters and retailers the partnerships with northern  producer associations have provided a source of reliable, high quality agricultural and seafood products at stable prices. ",205
positive,"At the national level, EGLR supports the government’s vision of economic growth  through exports, tackling unequal development across provinces and inclusive employment. ",206
positive,EGLR has largely achieved its goal and outcome targets of improved livelihoods of small-holder farmers  and increasing employment. ,207
positive,"It reached over 2,000 beneficiaries and raised cumulative income to over  US$2 million for each sector over two years. ",208
positive,It has also enabled Sri Lankan and international export  companies to source more fruit and vegetable and fisheries products reliably and at stable prices. ,209
positive,"Among the cooperatives previously supported by LEED, in Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu  and Vavuniya North, production incomes and commercial viability have reached high levels of maturity. ",210
positive,"EGLR’s provision of business development services and soft skills training and mentoring helped many  cooperatives to become better governed, commercial enterprises, providing financial and social welfare  services to members. ",211
positive,"In the fruit and vegetables sector the targeted cooperatives have established lucrative business  partnerships with export and domestic buyers for crops including Lady Red Papaya, banana, passion fruit  and Moringa leaves.",212
positive,"Comprehensive evidence of changes in individual incomes as a result of the  interventions is not available, but there are good indications from project reports and evaluation  interviews that household incomes have improved, reaching 40,000 – 50,000 LKR (US$ 240-300) on  average per month.",213
positive,EGLR also enabled more crop diversification as a successful resilience strategy. ,214
positive,"In fisheries, EGLR built on the LEED strategy, successfully supporting most of the targeted fishing cooperatives to become purchasing enterprises, thereby increasing fishers’ incomes by cutting out the  middle-man traders. ",215
positive,"The project also  helped more fishing households and communities to re-build their fishing assets, both individually and  collectively, and to redeem their debts to traders.",216
positive,"EGLR capitalized on opportunities in aquaculture to  help farmers set up collective sea cucumber farms as a lucrative source of livelihood for those not  involved in sea fishing, and to venture into mud crab farming. ",217
positive,"The ILO’s partnership with Taprobane Sea  Foods has helped to expand local employment for women in crab processing plants, creating around 600  jobs in total, meeting decent work standards.",218
positive,"As targeted beneficiaries, women made up more than half of those provided with  production inputs. ",219
positive,"As a result of the  project’s advocacy, inroads are gradually being made in increasing women’s participation in traditionally  male dominated cooperatives. ",220
positive,"Men are still the majority of cooperative boards of management, but  some women elected to boards are demonstrably empowered and taking an active role in the direction and vision of the cooperative.",221
positive,"Cooperative members in both sectors recounted an increased recognition  that women can be breadwinners alongside men, changes in household management of finances, and ix increased spending on education and health, which they attributed to gender discussion forums and  women’s increased economic role",222
positive,The management arrangements and staff capacity have been highly effective in the project delivery. ,223
positive,"The project demonstrated a strong level of cost-effectiveness, with a high  proportion of funds dedicated to the implementation of programme activities. ",224
positive,The allocation of human  resources was efficient with delivery achieved through a small team of field staff with extensive  expertise. ,225
positive,"Significantly, however, EGLR has shared its experience internationally, with notable influence on  practices in other post-conflict countries. ",226
positive,"The evaluation found that the capacities of most of the producer cooperatives to select new products, access wider markets and negotiate with buyers have been sustainably improved. ",227
positive,Among  individual farmers and fishers the evaluation found a high degree of confidence that their livelihood  means are now more stable. ,228
positive,"Private sector engagement in the North, particularly through the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE),  shows signs of continued growth.",229
positive,"The evaluation identified several good practices of EGLR which provide potential models for replication:  The central approach of strengthening producer cooperatives as viable business enterprises has  proven to be an effective approach for inclusive economic development;   Sea cucumber farming models share benefits equitably among small producer teams, including  women, markets are assured and farming meets environmental sustainability;  Supporting women’s producer associations was highly effective in building the economic  independence, social standing and empowerment of conflict-affected women;   Fostering champions among private sector peak bodies such as the NCE played a pivotal role in  introducing new export partners, strengthening north-south trust. ",230
positive,The objectives of the project are very consistent with the beneficiaries’ requirements because the  project intended to support the implementation of the NLMP and the protection of the migrant  workers and their families while overseas and upon their return.,231
positive,The project objectives were  closely aligned to those of the NLMP. ,232
positive,"In addition, the relevance of the LM Project to the needs of  Sri Lanka has been very high from the beginning as so many Sri Lankans are either working as  overseas labour migrants or are returning from overseas work. ",233
positive,The project also contributes to  specific country priorities in two ILO Decent Work Country Programmes (DWCP) for Sri Lanka  2013-17 and 2018-22.,234
positive,"The project design as laid down in the PRODOC is quite logical and coherent with a  comprehensive Logical Framework (LogFrame) defining the objectives, outcomes, outputs,  indicators and means of verification.",235
positive,"However, milestones were missing at this stage, but these  were later added to the Technical Progress Reports (TPR).",236
positive,"At this stage, there is no need to  modify the overall design of the project itself, but some suggestions will be given in the below for  changes of specific components and/or activities. ",237
positive,Most stakeholders also stressed that the  relevance of the project for the beneficiaries and for the country is still as valid as before.,238
positive,This has already been made more explicit in the TPR’s.,239
positive,The indicators in the  LogFrame are generally gender sensitive with explicit attention for women workers in the project  objectives. ,240
positive,"The lessons learned from Phases I and II were explicitly taken into account in  designing this Phase III project, including the six quite general lessons learned from Phase II. ",241
positive,Risks were on the whole properly assessed and made explicit in the LogFrame. ,242
positive,The self-assessment in the TPR  of March 2018 indicates that progress is more or less on track with an average of 42% of planned  activities completed nearing the halfway point of the project. ,243
positive,"The LM project has made important achievements which were explicitly underlined by most stakeholders, and a selection of summary  achievements has been given in Section 3.2 of this report. ",244
positive,"On the basis  of these achievements, it can be concluded that the project is expected to make substantial  progress in achieving its planned long-term and medium-term outcomes by the end of the project,  although the number of activities still to be initiated is also quite substantial.",245
positive,"Gender issues have received substantial  attention in the design and implementation of the project, although there is no solid  recommendation on gender mainstreaming in the NLMP’s NAP.",246
positive,"The institutional arrangements between MFE/SLBFE and ILO have been intensive, and it is  difficult to establish who takes more initiatives in which components. ",247
positive,"The Partner Exchange Platform (PEP) was indeed held  regularly, coordinated by ILO and organized by one of the SDC Partners on a rotating basis. ",248
positive,The project initiatives generally appear to have delivered value for money. ,249
positive,From the start of the  project in April 2016 until June 2018 the expenditures had reached in total only 25% of the total  project budget of over 1.5 million US$ (see Table 1).,250
positive,"The resources and inputs (funds, expertise,  time, etc.) have generally been allocated and used strategically to achieve the planned results,  but some imbalances have been perceived, for example while the IOM subcontract accounts for  one third of the total budget only 3 outputs are related to that sub-contract. ",251
positive,"At the same time, the  costs for the project staff can be considered relatively low with less than 16% especially in view  of the large number of sub-contracts to be managed. ",252
positive,"Concerning integrated gender equality, it  was assessed that most stakeholders are very much aware of the importance of including gender  mainstreaming in project implementation and are making efforts to have women included among  participants in workshops and training courses.",253
positive,"The project resources have been leveraged to  maximize impact with other related interventions, such as the contracts between SDC and the  SDC Partners, and the three other ILO projects in the area of LM forming together the LM Unit. ",254
positive,"As many of the outputs and activities  identified are closely aligned to the Government’s policy as laid down in the NLMP and the SLBFE  Act, the employed methodology was the right one, and the proper steps were taken to improve  the implementation of these policies.",255
positive,"In addition, the expenditures followed closely the proposed  budget lines. ",256
positive,"The value of the project, or the  percentage of budget that actually reached the primary and secondary beneficiaries is quite high  as the project worked very closely with MTDFE and SLBFE, as well as with SDC and its partners  and the different ILO offices.",257
positive,"As a whole, the results of Objective 1 are quite durable, especially because most of  them are embedded in the structures and policies of the Ministry and the Bureau, and the same  is true for the revision of the SLBFE-Act (1985).",258
positive,"The capacity building of recruitment agencies on  ethical recruitment is, once completed, a sustainable result which can be scaled up or replicated  by other partners.",259
positive,The results of Objective 2 also show a clear durable character with the FEDO  training manual and resource pack completed and the training of FEDOs started.,260
positive,"While the  revisions of the OM for labour attaches is ongoing, once completed and inserted they are fixed,  but require monitoring.",261
positive,"The establishment of a pilot SMB in Kurunegala has reached an important  step with the Gazette notification issued, and the inclusion of sections on migrant workers in  several NAPs is durable as well, e.g. on prevention of SGBV and on Human Rights. ",262
positive,Among the Objective 3 results the existence of the new Reintegration Unit is not only a sign of  durability but also of the concrete institutionalisation of the political will on the side of the  government.,263
positive,Among the results of Objective 4 the three Policy  Briefs published are tangible project outputs which contribute to visibility if widely disseminated. ,264
positive,"The same can be said of the international meetings and consultations held on the ILMS database  for South Asia and on the sharing of Sri Lanka experiences through the CP, the ADD and the  GCM.",265
positive,Overall ownership of the project has been relatively high from the beginning at the MFE as it was  oriented towards the implementation of the NLMP.,266
positive,The project objectives fit well with the national  priorities in the NLMP which the GOSL owns and uses to guide all its work on labour migration. ,267
positive,"As the SLBFE has been heavily involved in the implementation of the project, ownership here is  also substantial.",268
positive,"Overall, all partners were provided with opportunities to play a role in guiding the direction  of the project through advisory committees, expert groups, exchange platforms, sub-committees and stakeholder consultations, thereby taking at least some degree of ownership of the initiatives. ",269
positive,"Regional  governments have benefited from a number of activities and outputs under the project such as  the FEDO training, the pilot SMB, the Resource Directories, the promotion of ethical recruitment,  the work undertaken by the SDC Partner CSOs at the local level, and the support for return and  reintegration from the national level for the local level through the newly established Reintegration  Unit of the SLBFE.",270
positive,"The Government of Sri Lanka has been deeply involved in several international regional  consultative processes such as the CP, the ADD, the GCM and the ILMS meetings.",271
positive,"Certain outputs of the project are expected to be sustained over the middle or longer term, for  example the revised policy and regulatory framework (NLMP, SLBFE Act and Sub-Policy) will  have to be followed by all government organisations in the years to come.",272
positive,"The capacity building  efforts and the Reintegration Unit at the Bureau are in themselves a sustainable output, and the  developed training courses and manuals can be used to upscale the training (e.g. by  MFE/SLBFE).",273
positive,"The project has  strengthened the capacities of the government structures in various ways not least of which is the  learning by doing and by cooperating with ILO, IOM, UNWOMEN, Helvetas and the SDC Partner  CSOs.",274
positive,"By using the established channels within the government (especially SLBFE local offices  and FEDOs) and the CSO structures supported by the project, the migrant workers themselves  are in an indirect way contributing to the sustainability of the initiatives. ",275
positive,"Concerning the extent to which the impact of the project is sustainable over the longer term it has  been concluded that the tripartite approach, the policies and practices developed, and the  enhancement of the capacity building tools and capacities will all continue to protect migrant  women and men long into the future, provided the project is able to complete the planned outputs  and activities before the end of the project in February 2020. ",276
positive,"Regarding the dissemination of the publications produced under the project, ILO has identified a  two-page ‘Dissemination Strategy’ which includes target groups at international and national level.",277
positive,"Reporting has been quite transparent during the first two years of the project whereby ILO has  closely followed the requirements laid down in the Agreement between SDC and ILO dated 6  April 2016, submitting a Financial Report yearly, and a TPR bi-annually.",278
positive,The communications between the LM project and SDC were compared to those with many other  donors quite frequent.,279
positive,"In FYR Macedonia, the ILO promotes decent work as a national objective and assists constituents to  make progress towards achieving that objective.",280
positive,The EU funded project “Promoting  social dialogue” contributes to achievement of the goals under this priority of the DWCP.,281
positive,"This project  builds on the extensive work done by the ILO to support the establishment of the National Economic  and Social Council , develop amicable settlement of labour disputes legislation, and strengthen the  capacities of Employers and Workers organizations.",282
positive,The overall and specific objectives of the project were entirely relevant to the ambition of FYR  Macedonia to join the European Union.,283
positive,"In particular, the project addressed the needs of the country  to make progress in the field of social policy and employment, including social dialogue at tripartite  and bipartite levels that is required under Chapter 19 of the criteria for ability to assume the  obligations of membership.",284
positive,The project addressed the objectives of the DWCP to improve mechanisms of social dialogue through  strengthening the capacity of the social partners; enhancing the capacity of the tripartite ESCs at  national and local levels; by improving the capacity of the social partners to engage in collective  bargaining and; by establishing a mechanism for the amicable settlement of labour disputes.,285
positive,The project addressed the strategic objectives for social dialogue contained in the ILO Programme and  Budget for the periods covering the project; the ILO mandate for social dialogue under UNDAF 2010- 15 and; ILO mandate for social dialogue under the Partnership for Sustainable Development United  Nations Strategy 2016-20.,286
positive,"On the national level, the project equipped the NESC to allow it to function more effectively. ",287
positive,The  project has provided infrastructure to enable the NESC to operate as an effective body in providing  opinions and recommendations on legislation and policy to government.,288
positive,"Six new LESCs have been established in the following municipalities - Resen, Veles, Sveti Nikole, Struga,  Kichevo and Radovish.",289
positive,Each LESC has been provided with computer and other equipment to allow it to function effectively.,290
positive,The political crisis hindered the project’s work in developing national tripartite structures but that by  the end of the project these had been largely overcome and good progress has been made in the  development of the ESCs.,291
positive,"An innovative element of the strategy to promote collective bargaining involved the capacity-building  of social partners through the use of marketing, communications and business strategies to help them  grow their membership and gain greater credibility as representative organisations.",292
positive,"The marketing, communications and business strategies were especially useful for the Employers  Organisations who saw membership growth and an increase in their capacity as a result of the  intervention.",293
positive,Training interventions to improve the processes and outcomes of collective bargaining were validated  as high quality and correctly focussed.,294
positive,"The project has established a machinery for the amicable settlement of disputes through: the training  of 90 conciliators, 50 of whom have been licensed; the establishment and training of a tripartite  licensing commission; a case management information system; a publicity campaign to promote the  conciliation system; ongoing training of conciliators to a high standard; and the promotion of ALDS as  part of the process of social dialogue and tripartism.",295
positive,The project has been well-managed at the country and regional levels.,296
positive,"The ILO has provided significant  added value via its extensive resources base, technical expertise, project management backstopping,  and training inputs, making good use of its comparative advantage.",297
positive,"The project management structure and staffing levels were appropriate for a project of this size,  enabling the project to meet revised deadlines and requests for flexibility from project partners.",298
positive,The project was extended by six months to enable the activities to be completed. ,299
positive,"The project had created a significant infrastructure for all the three components, especially in relation  to the NESC and LESCs and for amicable settlement of labour disputes. ",300
positive,The PSDP met the needs of FYR Macedonia to improve the infrastructure in which social  dialogue can take place in order to meet the requirements set out by the European Union for  accession to the EU.,301
positive,The PSDP was in line with ILO global mandates and ILO regional and national strategic  priorities to improve social dialogue and increase the capacities of the social partners to  engage effectively in dialogue and tripartism. ,302
positive,The project adapted well to the challenging political environment in which it had to operate  and made good use of a no-cost six month extension to complete project activities.,303
positive,"A significant infrastructure has been established for the NESC and there is embryonic evidence  that the infrastructure is working, enabling the NESC to exercise its functions as a tripartite  advisory body. ",304
positive,"The six LESCs established by the project have the potential to influence decision-making at the  municipal level provided they continue to gain the support of the local tripartite actors, and if  the municipalities guarantee continued funding. ",305
positive,An operational machinery has been established that meets the objective of the project to  establish a system for the amicable settlement of labour disputes by establishing the  infrastructure in which conciliation can take place.,306
positive,"With four referrals to ASLD there are early signs that the system is working, but it is too early  to say whether ASLD process will become embedded as a significant alternative to the formal  court system.",307
positive,Stakeholder involvement in the project has been strong with good attendance at Steering  Committee meetings and significant commitment to project activities and events.,308
positive,Significant capacity has been built for the NESC and LESCs which has enabled them to start to  exercise their functions.,309
positive,Employers’ organisations have witnessed membership growth and enhanced capacity to  provide services to members as a result of the project.,310
positive,"The project has helped the country to incorporate international labour standards into national  law, most notably in relation to freedom of association and right to collective bargaining. ",311
positive,"Demand has been created by the project, notably to continue to learn from other countries;  to improve the legal environment to support social dialogue and; to continue to build the  expertise of the social partners for enhanced credibility.",312
positive,The critical factors that underpinned the project results were: the commitment of the national  project team; the comparative advantage provided by ILO backstopping and technical  expertise; and the support of the national tripartite actors.,313
positive,"The project has been managed efficiently and transparently, largely achieving the project  results, and making good use of ILO comparative advantage in social dialogue and  employment relations. ",314
positive,The project has strong potential for sustainability due to the infrastructure that has been built  but it will require the tripartite actors to make good use of the infrastructure in the future.,315
positive,"The project adequately promoted gender equality through its management structure,  programme of activities and monitoring of data.",316
positive,Separate marketing and communications strategies developed for EOs proved to be highly  successful with increased membership and capacity. ,317
positive,"Establishing an infrastructure in which social dialogue can take place through, inter alia,  provision of equipment, bespoke software, capacity-building practices (tripartite action plans,  communications strategies, business plans, operational plans, formalised procedures etc), and  high quality training interventions is validated as an effective project strategy.",318
positive,"The use by ILO of its comparative advantage in the field of social dialogue, collective  bargaining and industrial relations, working at the tripartite level is validated as a good  practice that added significant value to the project. ",319
positive,The ILO made effective and efficient use  of technical backstopping and project management support that is validated as providing  added security to funders and national stakeholders.,320
positive,"Regarding the first criteria, Relevance and Strategic Fit, we found that  the projects’ objectives and interventions are closely aligned to the National Skills Development  Policy (NSDP) 2011 of the Ministry of Education (MoE).",321
positive,"In addition, all stakeholders interviewed  during the mission in October-November 2018 have indicated explicitly that the focus on Skills  Development and TVET Reform is very relevant for Bangladesh at this stage of its development.",322
positive,"Nevertheless, they all participated in the landmark  Dhaka Skills Summit in December 2016.",323
positive,"The projects’ objectives and interventions are explicitly  aligned with the requirements of enterprises in the target sectors through the attention paid to the  development of Industrial Skills Councils (ISC), as well as of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) in  particular between public TVET institutions and private sector companies. ",324
positive,"The projects’ objectives  and interventions are also explicitly aligned with the requirements of workers for access to skills  and employment opportunities, especially for disadvantaged groups in the target sectors.",325
positive,B-SEP’s objectives are also closely aligned to ILO’s relevant Decent Work Country Programmes  (DWCP) for Bangladesh in particular DWCP 2017-2020 (Priority 1). ,326
positive,"The Project clearly supports  and contributes to the overall objectives of the policy of the donor country, Canada, including  CIDA’s Skills for Employment Programme and presently also remains aligned with GAC’s recently  adopted Feminist International Assistance Policy (FIAP) which focuses on women empowerment  and creating meaningful employable opportunities for young girls and women.",327
positive,The B-SEP project  and its activities have contributed further to progress both towards the achievement of SDG 4 on  inclusive and equitable quality education and of SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth. ,328
positive,"The project also contributed to achieving the objectives of several Outcomes under ILO’s 2018- 19 Programme and Budget (P&B), in particular Outcome 1 and 6. Lastly, the Project fits clearly  with the UNDAF 2017-20 priorities for Bangladesh, in particular Outcome 1.",329
positive,"Regarding Project Progress and Effectiveness, it was concluded that, overall, the project has  already achieved or is well positioned to achieve the large majority of its targets specified in the  Logic Model in the Project Document (PRODOC) of B-SEP. ",330
positive,"This Logic Model is quite coherent,  and includes Outcomes, Outputs, Activities and Targets.",331
positive,The expected changes form ILO’s contributions (under Outcomes 1.1 and  1.2) are seen to be logically linked to the outcomes of the logic model discussed above.,332
positive,Annex 7 provides a comprehensive overview of the project’s results and shows that the project  has achieved its immediate objectives to a large extent with an average of over 95 % of  achievements on its 30 targets. ,333
positive,The project employed a creative way of presenting the  achievements up to December 2017 with the “achievements wheel” (see Section 3.2).,334
positive,"Gender issues are generally not automatically addressed in Bangladesh, but the project has made  a number of efforts in that regard, such as several female staff members in the project team,  clauses in sub-contracts and stimulation of female members in committees, etc. ",335
positive,"It is typically lower when partners, managers, instructors and trainers  are targeted (often below 10%), but in five specific cases the gender ratio was between 45 and  85%.",336
positive,"Recently, the  project received international awards for disability inclusion and a national award for Employment  Support Service (ESS) at a technical training school. ",337
positive," In contrast, there were also a number of success factors in achieving the  results, such as the good working relationships maintained by ILO/B-SEP with key stakeholders (in particular MoE), the good participation from the Government when requested for their support  driven by the successive National Project Directors (NPD) in the Directorate of Technical  Education (DTE) under the MoE, the great willingness to participate shown by the industries, the  innovations not foreseen in the PRODOC, such as the Bangladesh Business and Disability  Network (BBDN), the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) Foundation and the green job  innovation. ",338
positive,"A large number of changes in the skills system can be attributed mainly to project outputs, such  as DTE’s budget allocation for NTVQF courses, the fact that Bangladesh Technical Education  Board (BTEB) under TMED of the MoE can now independently develop standards and conduct  certification, the increased enrolment of students with disabilities, women skilled in non-traditional  occupations, and strengthened apprenticeships.",339
positive,As shown in the text of the report the B- SEP project played in each case a very specific facilitating role.,340
positive,"The B-SEP project has maintained throughout a flexible approach and has been responding to  changing situations of the country or of constituents’ priorities, and some examples are given in  section 3.2.",341
positive,"The project has made different contributions to achieve the goals set for the NSDP,  and one of the biggest achievements was to have the NSDP integrally included in the 7th Five- Year Plan.",342
positive,Regarding ILO’s International Labour Conventions and Standards on skills development and  vocational training the most relevant one is Recommendation 195 which has not yet been ratified  by the Government of Bangladesh (GoB). ,343
positive,"Furthermore, the project has clearly contributed to achieving relevant outcomes in Bangladesh DWCPs, especially improved skills training and  enhanced employability through skill development including for green growth.",344
positive,"Both the  Employers’ and Workers’ Organizations (EO & WO) are members in the Project Steering  Committee (PSC) and are thus in principle informed about all activities of the project, and jointly  they were involved in organizing the Dhaka Skills Summit.",345
positive,"Regarding capacity building of social partners, B-SEP has implemented targeted programs for  EO and WO, and they were for example included in training on managing apprenticeships,  SCORE, Gender and Disability inclusion, coordination of ISCs and skills funding. ",346
positive,"The B-SEP project  has further made progress in several areas; for example, gender considerations have been  included in most sub-components of the project and we have seen under achievements that in all  except one of the 30 targets identified women did indeed participate, with an overall average level  of 22.4 %.",347
positive,"Considering the cultural issues involved in gender relations in Bangladesh, this is not  an un-substantial level.",348
positive,Gender has been dis-aggregated for all data in all project activities.,349
positive,"The project has made strategic use of coordination and collaboration with other related initiatives  to increase its effectiveness and impact especially with the EU-funded Skills21 project of the ILO,  the ADB/SDC’s SEIP, WB/GAC’s STEP and DFID/SDC’s Sudokkho projects.",350
positive,"Lastly, coordination also takes place through the  Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) on TVET/Skills sector chaired by the Secretary of TMED.",351
positive,"The project has managed the practice of knowledge management, lessons dissemination and  visibility of project branding quite well, especially given that there was no full-time dedicated  communications officer in B-SEP.",352
positive,"A Communications Plan was developed in of August 2015,  books, reports, leaflets and brochures of good quality were produced and distributed, and innovative means were also used (e.g. the ‘achievements-circle’, videos, green jobs documentary and the photobook on women)",353
positive,"Considering the large number of  achievements summarized before, it can be concluded that in general the project delivered value  for money",354
positive,The different project resources have also been allocated strategically to achieve the  expected results. ,355
positive,"On 31 December 2018, a balance is expected of  just over US$ 270,000 which will be used for a possible no-cost extension.",356
positive,"The project managed  the finances well, with clear yearly Technical Cooperation Progress Reports (TCPR) to the donor.",357
positive,"Overall,  the project funds and activities have been delivered in a timely manner and by now over 95% delivery rate has been achieved. ",358
positive,"Relatively substantial resources were allocated strategically in order to mainstream gender- related issues, including the training of women, mainstreaming of the National Strategy for Gender  Equality in TVET within three ministries, gender guidelines, gender training to employers,  development of Gender Guidelines for TVET administrators, national gender workshop, and  training of the 118 TVET institutions under DTE on gender and on gender planning and budgeting. ",359
positive,"As a result, all TVET institutes under DTE have a Gender Plan and Budget.",360
positive,"The B-SEP project has been collaborating especially with the Skills21 project in sharing some  resources, and there were close contacts with projects implemented by others (in particular SEIP,  STEP and Sudokkho), and further cooperation is planned for the coming years through the Sector  Wide Approach (SWAp) on TVET/Skills.",361
positive,"In general, the Effectiveness of Management Arrangements of the B-SEP project was clearly  satisfactory.",362
positive,It concerns a large project with a five-year implementation period and a substantial  budget of over US$ 16 million. ,363
positive,"This has been a good modus operandi, except that the four components at  times were operating independently of each other.",364
positive,"The monitoring mechanism set up for B-SEP has been very instrumental for its success, for  example it was crucial that the Project Monitoring & Coordination Committee (PMCC) meetings  have been held so regularly throughout the five-year project duration, while at the same time there  were some initial problems with conducting the Project Steering Committee (PSC) meetings which  were solved with the arrival in 2016 of the current TMED Secretary chairing it.",365
positive,"Both committees  are chaired by the GoB which is crucial because the prioritisation of components and activities in  the B-SEP project is established at those committees, and this is therefore an important element  of ownership. ",366
positive,MOLE was an important part of the project through the involvement of the NSDC. ,367
positive,"The project also  included an M&E system, the Performance Measurement Framework, that collected sex- disaggregated data to monitor results.",368
positive,"The MTE commented already in 2016 on the fact that there  was no dedicated M&E/Knowledge Management officer, following which the project has made a  number of adjustments. ",369
positive,"In addition, a timely Technical Review was undertaken in August 2018  partly also as input to the development of a concept note for a new project.",370
positive,It has made a series of clear  contributions to TVET reform which are listed in Section 3.5. ,371
positive,"In addition, TVET Reform and Skills  Development have been the subject for tripartite social dialogue, such as at the Dhaka Skills  Summit in 2016 and its planned follow-up in March 2019.",372
positive,"As a result of the fact that the project was from the beginning closely aligned to the NSDP of the  MoE, ownership of the Project has been increasing over the years especially at DTE and BTEB  of the MoE.",373
positive,"Although the Project does not have an exit strategy per se, it has developed an innovative strategy  to ensure sustainability once the project ends by means of the Sustainability Workshop and the  measures announced there (see section 3.5).",374
positive,"Generally, the project’s knowledge and experience  seem to have been effectively transferred to the national partners as is evident from the analysis  in the present chapter. ",375
positive,GP1: The use of the so-called ‘Sustainability Workshop’ towards the end of the project period as  a kind of exit strategy is a Good Practice to be followed by many other projects.,376
positive,GP2: The landmark Dhaka Skills Summit organized in December 2016 was a Good Practice of  Tripartite Cooperation.,377
positive,GP3: The use of ILO’s flagship programme of SIYB and registering the so-called “SIYB  Foundation of Bangladesh” officially is a Good Practice to be replicated elsewhere. ,378
positive,The evaluation found solid evidence  of intermediate outcomes that have  the potential to lead to the ultimate  goal of ensuring humane and orderly  management of irregular migration in  Southern Africa.,379
positive,The evaluation also  found evidence of positive unintended  outcomes beyond the project’s set targets  and good practices that can be integrated  into future interventions.,380
positive,There is  evidence suggesting good progress  towards the achievement of this goal. ,381
positive,One concrete example includes  the various cross-border fora led by  governments which facilitate bilateral  collaboration on irregular migration  management between Zambia and  Zimbabwe; Zimbabwe and South Africa;  South Africa and Mozambique and others. ,382
positive,"In addition, over the past six years, MIDSA  has generated several recommendations  that have been implemented at country  level albeit at different levels. ",383
positive,"Informants described MIDSA as a  unique platform, which provides an  ideal environment for SADC Member  States to have meaningful dialogue  on migration governance and related  challenges affecting the region. ",384
positive,"This non- binding organic process has effectively  set a path for honest dialogue, sharing  lessons learnt and ignited bilateral and  multilateral engagement on sensitive  migration governance matters among  and between SADC member states. ",385
positive,"To some extent this was achieved, as  demonstrable increase in knowledge and  skills were evident in all the six countries.",386
positive,"As it will be seen in the section of the  report, project reports, KIIs and site  observation data pointed to evidence of  improved skills in knowledge in detecting  victims of trafficking, in screening and  referring vulnerable migrants such  as Unaccompanied Migrant Children  (UMCs).",387
positive,There are also evidence of unintended  positive outcomes attributed to the CB  component. ,388
positive,"For example, informants who  benefited from the training workshops  believed that the training ignited inter- sectorial collaboration and coordination  on Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) and  Unaccompanied Migrant Children (UMCs)  case management that would otherwise  not have been possible.",389
positive,This created a safe space  for them to learn from each other and to  identify opportunities for collaborations.,390
positive,"This finding is in line with the definition  of capacity development by actors in  the field of development as a process  through which individuals, organizations  and societies obtain, strengthen and  maintain capabilities to set and achieve  their desired positive change (see better  evaluation, 2016)4",391
positive,"During the  course of six years, over 1,522 vulnerable  migrants were successfully returned  through the project DA.",392
positive,"While they were fully satisfied  with the service they received from IOM  throughout the process of returning  home, they regretted having volunteered  to return home because they realized  the conditions that led them to their  migration in the first place remained the  same or got worse.",393
positive,"Nevertheless, the  AVR proved to be a crucial glue of IOM’s  partnership alliance with governments  and development organizations towards  a more holistic and longer term response  to irregular migration in Southern African  region.",394
positive,"It strongly appears that through the  process of providing AVR to vulnerable  migrants, the project was able to achieve  other intended and unintended positive  changes, including strengthening  bilateral and cross-border collaboration  beyond planned results.",395
positive,"Through the  DA component, several sustainable  migration management infrastructures  (e.g. cross-border collaboration and  coordination mechanisms, AVR screening  tools and guidelines, etc.) were developed  and are effectively used with government  increasingly taking a lead across all the six  countries and at regional level.",396
positive,"In a nutshell, findings from KIIs, project  documents review and observations  at the sites suggest that the quality of  multi-sectorial collaboration at regional,  national and local levels on irregular  migration challenges contributed to  multiple project intermediate outcomes at  various levels.",397
positive,"Collectively, these realized  interdependent outcomes have the  potential to lead to the development and  strengthening of needed infrastructure  for sustainable humane and orderly  migration governance in the SADC region. ",398
positive,"To achieve the intended outcome, the project proposed the following outputs: • Information is available on passengers for pre-security screening at the international airport through APIS; • GoB is able to register all resident permits and extend visas using the MIDAS; • GoB is able to verify all registration in the MIDAS against INTERPOL’s Fixed INTERPOL Network Database (FIND); and, • Government officials have capacity to use all four (4) modules of the MIDAS upgrade.",399
positive,"Based on the analysis, the following are the main findings of the evaluation: 1. Improved security of migrants: migrants crossing the Belizean border daily are now registered and can be tracked, which prevents them from being unaccounted for. ",400
positive,"This addressed a special concern of the GoB regarding the Belize/Guatemala border, as school children crossing this border daily can now be securely tracked using the Cross-Border Identification Card (CBIC). ",401
positive,"New data is available to inform policy making: the information provided by the MIDAS on permits, visas, CBICs and exits/entries is greatly appreciated and used not only by the Department of Immigration and Nationality Services (DINS) for statistical analyses, trends and profiling, but also by the Ministry of Labour, the Belize Justice, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)1 , and the Belize Tourism Board, among others. ",402
positive,History of migration status is recorded: visa and residence permit extensions allow the GoB to maintain records of the migration history of migrants.,403
positive,"In addition, for those whose visa has expired and want to exit the country, it is now possible to extend the visa at the BCP, instead of having to go to the DINS headquarters in Belmopan, thereby saving people’s time and money.",404
positive,Improved efficiency of the border crossing services: time to cross the border has been reduced. ,405
positive,"The CBICs speed up the registration process, as cards only need to be scanned to verify the information of the traveler, unlike the residence permits for which the information needs to be checked manually by the frontline officer at the BCP.",406
positive,"In addition, CBICs prevent people from using their passport or residence permit every time they cross the border (where they get stamped at each exit and entry). ",407
positive,"This, in turn, reduces the costs associated with passport/permit renewal.",408
positive,Relevance: The project is relevant is the context of Georgia as it was fully designed in line with IOM  priorities as well as the Government of Georgia’s National Action Plan on Combating Trafficking in  Persons and the National Strategy for the Protection of Human Rights in Georgia.,409
positive,"More precisely, the  project was designed in line with the NAP objectives to raise awareness among the public about  combating TIP and to build capacity of professionals dealing with TIP, including law enforcement,  employees of the State Fund and staff of the Labor Inspection Department. ",410
positive,"During the project design process, IOM consulted with relevant stakeholders, particularly the Ministry  of Justice as well as the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Office of the Chief Prosecutor and the State  Fund as constituent members of the Coordination Council, to ensure the project aligns with CT needs  identified by the relevant state bodies.",411
positive,IOM continued close cooperation with partners during project  implementation and responded adequately to changing priorities or newly identified needs such  requests from stakeholders for additional capacity building assistance. ,412
positive,"Effectiveness: IOM actively involved stakeholders during implementation of the project, such as during  trainings and implementation of the information campaign which was highly appreciated by  stakeholders.",413
positive, IOM’s flexibility to adapt to changing needs was especially highlighted by interviewees  as a strong point.,414
positive,"The project was quite effective in reaching the intended outputs and outcomes,  though certain issues originating from the project’s design reduced overall effectiveness, as described  below. ",415
positive,The information campaign was to a certain extent effective in raising awareness among the public  about TIP in order to reduce the demand for services of VoTs. ,416
positive,"Of these, the majority indicated expecting to  share the information they received or report TIP instances to investigative authorities.",417
positive,The trainings were effective in building capacity of stakeholders in the respective training areas and  the practical examples and tools that were shared were much valued by trainees.,418
positive,The trainings were  a good opportunity for relevant actors to learn about each other’s role within the NRM.,419
positive,The re-allocation of funds allowed for efficient  implementation of the revised project activities in line with newly-identified needs during the project.,420
positive,This  indicates some contribution of the campaign towards increased awareness on the issue of demand for  VoT services. ,421
positive,"The impact of the information campaign is difficult to determine as no data is available indicating  whether there has been an increase in reporting of trafficking incidents, though respondents from the  assessment confirmed their intentions to report cases should they encounter such situations. ",422
positive,The project contributed to the enhanced capacities of stakeholders to investigate TIP cases and identify  VoTs as corroborated by national statistics as well as inter-agency coordination as interlocutors  indicated the trainings helped to understand the work and role of other agencies.,423
positive,It was thus  possible to completely hand over the information campaign to ensure continuation of the campaign  after project completion until materials run out. ,424
positive,"Despite some of these issues related to sustainability of project components, overall there was a high  degree of national ownership of the project because of the involvement of national stakeholders  extensively in the design and implementation.",425
positive,Interlocutors confirmed their commitment to  combating TIP which shows for example through the development of amendments to laws and  guidelines.,426
positive,"As regards implementation, IOM actively encouraged participation of women working in  traditionally male-dominated professions in trainings which resulted in 41% of participants being  women.",427
positive,The guidelines on identification of VoTs developed for border control officials were gender  mainstreamed and paid particular attention to vulnerabilities of women and girls in comparison to  men and boys.,428
positive,"The Annual Report which is produced by the Coordination Council on the  Implementation of the Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings is considered a good  practice, though can be improved by independently evaluating achievements on NAP indicators. ",429
positive,Capacity building on identification and involvement of NGOs in the monitoring and reporting process  to increase transparency is also encouraged. ,430
positive,The campaign was successful in reaching members of its intended target group and met a clear demand for information on migration among community members. ,431
positive,Larger villages were not more likely than smaller villages to host the relevant target group.,432
positive,"Further target group analysis revealed that those potential migrants with more financial means were more likely to fit the ideal CinemArena target group, i.e. having strong migration intentions and little knowledge about migration. ",433
positive,The majority of participants found the campaign to be informative and touching.,434
positive,Most remembered key messages from the event even three months after participation.,435
positive,Almost all respondents who attended the events said they would like to receive more information about migration in the future.,436
positive,The causal impact estimate (DiD) shows that participating in CinemArena film and discussion events: • Increases awareness of the dangers of irregular migration by 10 per cent; • Increases the percentage of people with knowledge of the financial costs related to irregular migration by 23 per cent; • Reduces stated intentions to migrate to Europe without a visa (i.e. irregularly) by 10 per cent; and • Increases positive perceptions of future economic opportunities at home by 19 per cent.,437
positive,In terms of relevance the evaluation found that the project was indeed addressing a GoS priority and  that the project idea emanated from the government itself which is a best practice. ,438
positive,Due to this GoS  cooperation and support to the project was optimal.,439
positive,It was inline with the GoS and SADC priorities on  TiP and was supporting the GoS to fulfil its obligations under the Palermo Protocol.,440
positive,The project achieved all its targets and to a large extent contributed well to stated outcomes.,441
positive,"Some results however from  IOM’s technical assistance that came along side the project activities that led to passing of the CT law,  6 development of a national stragegy and strengthening the NCCTiP contributed to sustainability of the  TiP eforts.",442
positive,"Contribution to the overall objective can also be seen in the continued existece of the NCCTiP, first  ever case of TiP that is under processing, improvement in ranking when the project was running among others. ",443
positive,"The evaluation concludes that the project was largely succesful but as typical in all projects, there are  important lessons learned and areas of improvement that similar future projects could take into  account.",444
positive,Transition plans  bring to the fore the critical peacebuilding gaps that result from mission drawdown or closure. ,445
positive,"The project has made limited progress in the field of collective bargaining, notably by  developing a tripartite action plan, providing high quality ILO materials to support collective  bargaining and making use of specialists to assist the social partners to improve collective  bargaining.",446
positive,Currently discussions have been initiated for the inclusion of skills development issues  in the 8th Five-Year plan.,447
positive,"The project identified one  outcome: “The Government of Belize (GoB) will more efficiently process applications for visa extensions and  residence permits, giving due consideration to facilitating genuine travelers and migrants, while  being able to more effectively interdict those travelling irregularly or who appear on international  watch lists.” ",448
positive,CCAP was delivered in time on the original budget; extension time was  necessitated due to availability of extra budget and unexpected security  situation. ,449
positive,Linking the assets recovery businesses with micro-finance institutions can enable the businesses to grow  and to enhance their competitiveness in the market. ,450
positive,"The Project addressed operational issues that hinder  integrated sustainable management of the country’s protected areas, focusing on the country’s  Southern Circuit.",451
positive,These threats to protected areas in the country are multiple and the Project  addressed several issues related to protected areas’ management in the country.,452
positive,A series of processes and products were also implemented with a fair level of efficiency. ,453
positive,"In particular, activities/training and support for patrolling against poaching, law enforcement,  facilities for reporting poaching, upgrading of physical resources and infrastructure to deal with  several aspects of PA management.",454
positive,The latter included vehicle donations and installation of  digital communication resources.,455
positive,Outreach materials and outreach activities were else conducted with a high  visibility.,456
positive,"A number of studies and documents have been produced, bridging both areas of work  (i.e. protected area management and tourism promotion), promoting visibility, and fostering a  series of knowledge management products.",457
positive,"These have included (among others) business plans,  financial plans, and other such studies that attempt to set an economic background and promote  financial sustainability of the processes being implemented in the target region. ",458
positive,A key area that straddles promotion of tourism as well as improved management of  protected areas in the country has been work with the communities that surround the national  parks in Tanzania’s South West.,459
positive,"Although livelihood promoting activities were minor and piloted  and this was one of the gaps identified throughout several monitoring and assessment exercises  that this project has had, work with the communities has been quite extensive and have created  the relations and outreach that should be promoted in the future. ",460
positive,"The demarcation and clearing  of boundaries between villages and protected areas, which reduces conflicts and mitigates  encroachment into PAs, has been one of the most evident processes of work with neighbouring  communities. ",461
positive,"At this level, the Project also assumed training and education of community  members. ",462
positive,The immediate next stages of follow up should further advance the adoption of the  products and processes that SPANEST has achieved (as laid out in the exit strategy) in order for  this intervention to maintain effects and continuity.,463
positive,"The Project is concluding with several key  achievements, mainly at the output and at the local pilots’ levels, that have laid the groundwork  for better management of protected areas and for development associated with growth in  Southwest Tanzania.",464
positive,"Although SPANEST is evidently ending, it would greatly benefit the country  to channel post – project activities in order to build upon what has been attained and to seek  continuous tangible results from these accomplishments.",465
positive,"Based on the review and  assessment and taking into consideration the complex nature of the Project, the overall rating  on the achievement of results is Moderately Satisfactory. ",466
positive,"Individuals with practical, hands-on experience with implementing this project learned  significant lessons about how to coordinate and manage a project that addresses a new and  complex suite of issues, with relatively limited funds, short implementation period, and limited  technical and operational support, and presumably will be able to apply them in the future. ",467
positive,"Based on the review and  assessment and taking into consideration the complex nature of the Project, the overall rating  on the achievement of results is Moderately Satisfactory.",468
positive,"This ABS  project while focused on ABS and Nagoya protocol, it also integrated sustainable  livelihood and biodiversity conservation into its design mainly through component  number 3.",469
positive,"This project proves that a local company with the interest, vision,  and needed support can achieve the work that might need many people to do.",470
positive,"The project reports indicated that the deliverable related to strengthening national regulatory and institutional framework for ABS reached less than 40% achievement; the capacity building  and awareness-raising for the implementation of the national ABS framework achieved around  75%, and the project reported the bio-discovery and benefit-sharing based on the traditional  knowledge on bone and cartilage regeneration 95% achieved. ",471
positive,"The project reports indicated that the deliverable related to strengthening national regulatory and institutional framework for ABS reached less than 40% achievement; the capacity building  and awareness-raising for the implementation of the national ABS framework achieved around  75%, and the project reported the bio-discovery and benefit-sharing based on the traditional  knowledge on bone and cartilage regeneration 95% achieved.",472
positive,"Relevance: The project is well-aligned with the strategic priorities for the Parliament of Tanzania,  and the design of project activities reflects the stated priorities and the documented objectives  and outputs for parliamentary stakeholders. ",473
positive,The National Assembly in partnership with UNDP  endeavored to implement NA-identified technical assistance priorities as evidenced by the  various Guidelines that are being used to conduct committee and house business on a regular  basis.,474
positive,"Given the uncertainties forthcoming at first as a result of the civic elections in Local  Government Authorities (LGAs) held on 24 November 2019 and depending on the nature of  subsequent 2020 parliamentary elections, the project remains relevant to the stated concerns of  stakeholders to support political pluralism in legislative work as required by the Constitution of  the United Republic of Tanzania.",475
positive,"A previous  reliance on seminars, trainings and other one-off events as noted in the LSP I terminal evaluation  has evolved in response to include study tours, on-site mentoring in partnership with the UNDP LSP II office housed in the Bunge in Dodoma, and the production of knowledge products intended  to promote institutional strengthening of Parliament independent of UNDP intervention.",476
positive,"Efficiency: The inputs to the project were identified as a key factor in the project’s success to  date, including in regards to cost-effective use of human and material resources dedicated to the  project.",477
positive,This is also reflected in the management of project implementation and an increasing  reliance on mentoring and training in-country rather than on one-off training events. ,478
positive,"While there  is ongoing effort to reflect on and revise project outputs, the modality whereby a full-time  resident UNDP staff works daily with Bunge project coordinator(s) and various departments (e.g.  M&E, research, committee staff) and MPs has enhanced the efficiency and value for money of  project implementation.",479
positive,This is matched by the professional capacity and efficient technical  assistance provided by the project Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) based in Dar-es-Salaam. ,480
positive,The  ongoing effort to provide practical technical assistance twinned with tools that MPs and staff can  use on a daily basis independent of other forms of intervention increased the impact and  efficiency of funds from international development partners (DPs) spent and technical assistance  provided.,481
positive,This is evidenced by the relatively high number of activities implemented in the first 2 years of project implementation whilst the implementation rate (e.g. percentage of funds  reported spent to date) remains relatively low.,482
positive,"In accordance with recognised international  standards and as a reflection of the efficient use of funds from DPs, MPs are engaging  incrementally in regional and international best practice in such areas as budget scrutiny,  standing order revision and implementation, and committee (and staff) professional conduct. ",483
positive,"However,  and despite interlocutor request(s) to continue this aspect of the project during the MTE, there  are opportunities for skills transfer and knowledge sharing between and among participants in- country and possibly from neighboring countries.",484
positive,"For example, those who participated in MP  and staff study tours to Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya (etc.) could be engaged as peer-to- peer mentors at relatively low cost and with direct impact as such advice and interaction relates  to specific areas and issues of concern to individual MPs and in committee sessions. ",485
positive,"Likewise, contacts made with particularly effective and relevant counterparts identified by  previous study tour participants could be engaged as part of distance learning mentors (e.g.  Skype, WhatsApp) and utilising the forthcoming e-Parliament tools such as the NA App combined  with a parliamentary intranet platform housed on each MP’s tablet. ",486
positive,"These outputs are addressed in detail in the body of this  report, but include: • active budget scrutiny and budget oversight; • a more professional staff and MPs who are more aware of and able to fulfill their  representation and legislative functions; 7 • increased capacity and willingness to engage the public in the legislative process at the  committee level through public hearings and printed notices soliciting public input into  pending legislation, and; • parliamentary staff and members continuing to perform key legislative functions  including legislating and constituent representation.",487
positive,The implementation of the Budget Law is another milestone which has resulted in a more active  and constituent-responsive legislature. ,488
positive,"However, based  on review of project progress reports, lessons learned, and interviews with project beneficiaries, the MTE finds the documentation of procedures and best-practices for budget oversight, bill  scrutiny, gender mainstreaming, and public hearings was an effective way of achieving a more  effective, open, transparent, accessible and inclusive Parliament as outlined in LSP II Programme  Document.",489
positive,"As a result, the proportion of MPs who can conduct effective bill scrutiny increased  from 12% in 2016 to 31% in 2018.",490
positive,"Overall, the project is on track to  achieve the project-end target of 8 Committees trained on bill scrutiny by 2021. ",491
positive,"Sustainability: For the National Assembly, the project to date was able to institutionalise key  reforms such as the budget oversight process, which reflects sustainable technical and process  capacity.",492
positive,Human Rights: The evaluation team found that most interlocutors agreed with human rights in  concept and that MPs and staff strive to ensure that the National Assembly recognizes and  practices its obligation as part of its representative (and constitutional) mandate to protect and  defend the human rights of all citizens of Tanzania. ,493
positive,"Gender Mainstreaming: The process of data collection and engagement with available MPs, staff  and other parliamentary stakeholders during the evaluation indicates that most (if not all)  evaluation participants were well-aware and accepting of not only the concept of gender  mainstreaming but also the importance of its implementation as part of the daily business of the  Bunge toward the goal of sustainable incorporation of gender mainstreaming concepts and  practice in parliament’s longer-term institutional development.",494
positive,This also extends to intra- parliamentary conduct and external engagement. ,495
positive,"For example, despite the social obstacles  presented to women parliamentary candidates when running for office, once elected and in  office, women constituent MPs and TWPG Executive Committee members with support from LSP  II were able to engage first-term women special seats MPs in performing their representative,  legislative, and oversight duties as Members of Parliament representing the people of Tanzania.",496
positive,Engagement with Parliament to conduct gender mainstreaming has been enhanced by the recent  placement of a Gender Technical Specialist in the UN Sub-Office in Dodoma.,497
positive,"In partnership with  UN Women, the project conducted a comprehensive gender audit and capacity assessment at  the beginning of LSP II.",498
positive,"The audit which was the first of its kind for the NA identified several gender gaps in the institutional structure, Standing Orders and staff capacities and resulted in  formulation of the NA Gender Strategy and Action Plan. ",499
positive,"Several activities spelled-out in the  Gender Strategy including the draft Gender Mainstreaming guidelines/handbook were approved  by the Parliamentary Service Commission in September 2019, training to the Budget Office (BO), oversight and sectoral committees’ clerks and members, and formulation of the Gender Male  Champion (He4She) advocacy strategy. ",500
positive,All were supported and implemented by the NA. ,501
positive,"In accordance with the United Nations Development Assistance Plan (2016-2021/UNDAP II),  there is progress noted toward achieving the 12 UNDAP programme outcomes,3 including toward  democratic governance, human rights for women, and gender equality in parliamentary affairs— including for individual MPs, members of the Tanzania Women’s Parliamentary Group (TWPG),  women serving on committees, and as part of parliament’s staffing and public outreach activities.",502
positive,"Gender mainstreaming is becoming institutionalised by individual MPs, in committee,  and in the whole House with support of the Speaker. ",503
positive,"The project colaborates with a large number of partners including Governmental institutions, national and local NGOs and scientific institutions.",504
positive,SGP Bolivia partners with national NGOs with technical and financial management skils that are present in the project areas to mentor community groups and to contribute to capacity building eforts and monitoring on the ground.,505
positive,Al MTR Recommendations were properly adresed by the Project. ,506
positive,"After reviewing documents, interviewing a broad range of stakeholders, partners and beneficiaries, and visiting and observing several field locations of SGP activities, the main conclusions of this Terminal Evaluation are: 1. The curent project ful size coresponding to the 5th Operational Phase of the GEF SGP is relevant to the GEF and country objectives with which it must be consistent.",507
positive,The progres made until the MTR time shows that the project has achieved its planed objectives and most of its outcomes (85%) in either a highly satisfactory or a satisfactory way.,508
positive,"Considering the 50% of the grant projects are stil active and that the Project wil remain active until December 2015, it is expected that this situation wil improve even more.",509
positive,Al MTR recommendations within the sphere of Project decisions were fulfiles.,510
positive,The project has operated within the historical average eficiency of SGP projects.,511
positive,Some previous studies have shown that this eficiency is god in relation to the general average of GEF funded projects.,512
positive,"The products of the SGP investments and activities are visible in the field in form of beter practices in the farms, reforestations, silvopastoral systems, new productive sustainable alternatives, equipment, instalations, plans, strengthened organizations, beter water management, etc.",513
positive,"The SGP main partners such as CBOs, NGOs, involved Protected Areas, local Governments, etc, have a very high opinion about the SGP involvement and commitment.",514
positive,The relationship with the UNDP Country Ofice is excelent. ,515
positive,"There is god knowledge of the activities, active involvement of the UNDP Program Oficer in the NSC and coperation betwen SGP and other UNDP and GEF projects.",516
positive,The monitoring and evaluation system is very god and provides apropriate information for both decision-making and reporting.,517
positive,The reporting to the GEF Tracking Tols was fulfiled as expected by the SGP Bolivia National Cordination.,518
positive,Monitoring of co-financing commitments is strong.,519
positive,Actual progres in co-financing is close to 85%.,520
positive,"Considering that the majority of the grant Projects are stil under implementation and have not submited their final reports, and the last group of grant projects began in 2015 it is expected that the co-financing targets wil be met easily.",521
positive,The varied and numerous strengths and oportunities of the project and its inovative potential provide a strong basis for the development of an atractive proposal for the GEF OP6 aiming to continue and expand the SGP actions and impacts.,522
positive,"A program with a history of many years as the Bolivia SGP had many oportunities to improve and adjust its operations, and it is evident that they have ben using them to advance an operation that performs very wel.",523
positive,"Therefore, even when there are minor things to be improved here and there, none of them are relevant enough to be included at the same level of relevance of the group previously presented in this chapter.",524
positive,"As said, a minor aspect that do not tarnish the excelent performance of the Bolivia SGP in OP5.",525
positive,A manual was developed and used the basis for M&E.,526
positive,Baselines studies were undertaken for the target areas.,527
positive,"During the last two years substantial achievements have  been made, meaning that most targets have been met ",528
positive,The Outcome is highly relevant ,529
positive,The tasks were systematically implemented with some delay  in delivery of results to villagers ,530
positive,The Outcome is highly relevant,531
positive,The various capacity development activities were  systematically planned and implemented. ,532
positive,"The institutional framework is institutionalized by having  completely formulated NABP II, PBSAP Xiengkhouang and  established ABD SSWG as a platform.",533
positive,ABP has achieved their mandate and many results have been created.,534
positive,Overall the institutional  Framework for agro-biodiversity conservation related actions by integrating into land use policies and  land planning have been set and ABP has therefore been the pioneering project as intended.,535
positive,"ABP could  be an example for similar projects in term of implementation method and coordination with other  agencies working completely formulated NABP II, PBSAP Xiengkhouang and established ABD SSWG as  a platform.in agro-biodiversity conservations issues.",536
positive,"The impacts created on the targeted beneficiaries are summarized below will be sustained if ABP  initiatives will find continued uses: Government staff and organizations ABP has supported Government staff of the implementing partners to enhanced knowledge through  the training events arranged, through study tours to neighbor countries and through dialogue with  visitors from neighbors during their visits to ABP project sites.",537
positive,Government staffs have through TOT  x been equipped with required skills to extend and explain the content of ABP developed tools.,538
positive,The  Government staffs involved in ABP activities have now enhanced knowledge in biodiversity  conservation issues and how to use tools developed by ABP in formulating local strategies for natural  resources management and conservation. ,539
positive,Vertical and horizontal communication within ministries and in between has been eye openers useful  for future applications in ordinary working situations and within other projects.,540
positive," As a specific example  can be mentioned, that the cooperation with other agencies could contribute as technical service  providers. ",541
positive,The villagers in ABP target villages have learnt about the agro-biodiversity conservation issue and  knowledge. ,542
positive,"Interested villagers (model farmers) have been provided with opportunities to conserve  local plant varieties such as wild tae, fish conservation and Milentha for preservation and livelihood`s  improvement.",543
positive,Other villagers have observed and in discussions with the model farmers learnt which  techniques are feasible and under what conditions. ,544
positive,ABP was a first strategically important project dealing with integrating the biodiversity conservation in  land use policies.,545
positive,Accordingly ABP initiated a number of steps to concretize actions for mainstreaming  agro biodiversity conservation in land use policies and plans.,546
positive,The ARISE  project contributes to ILO objectives of promoting compliance with fundamental principles and rights at  work in the rural and urban informal economy as well as in enterprises and in global supply chains.,547
positive,The project approach and strategy mirrored the needs of all the project beneficiaries. ,548
positive,"Withdrawal of  children from labour and supporting them to fully reintegrate to formal schools, through support with  schooling materials and availability of catch up classes worked well to retain children in school. ",549
positive,Complementary Basic Education (CBE) offered in Community Based Service Outlet Centres (CBSOC)  and vocational skills training offered youth literacy and numeracy skills and avenues to earn a decent  living respectively. ,550
positive,Support with Income Generating Activities (IGAs) for parents was aimed at replacing  incomes from child labour and improving incomes for households to better protect their children.,551
positive,"This is  what all the parents, the team met, wished for. ",552
positive,"Further, the project was aligned and in tandem with  government plans and aspirations—Malawi Vision 2020, Malawi Growth and Development Strategy III  (MGDS III), Child Labour National Action Plan (NAP), Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) and  United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF).

positive,The project benefited from lessons learnt in ARISE I. ,554
positive,The use of the IABA approach worked well in  concentrating interventions by different duty bearers and actors in a specific area in efforts to create a  child labour free zone.,555
positive,"The mix of partners, especially those at downstream level, was strategic and  enabled easy penetration into the community and across the project target groups",556
positive,"Partnership with  government led to quick and sustainable gains—the mainstreaming of child labour in the learning  curriculum, for instance.",557
positive,"Overall, the project goal, immediate objectives for the global ARISE II project and those for the Malawi  project, project outcomes, outputs, activities and indicators were clear and logically connected.",558
positive,The  design allowed for presentation of gender disaggregated data which was maintained in the reports.,559
positive,"From the findings, immediate objective 1 for Malawi was achieved.",560
positive,"This was evidenced by efforts to  develop and improve laws and policies—the child labour policy, the National Employment and Labour Policy (NELP) 2018, the HIV/AIDS workplace Policy and the NAP on trafficking in persons—mainstreaming of  child labour issues into the teaching curriculum and equipping teachers with Supporting Children’s Rights  through Education, Arts and Media (SCREAM) methodology skills to promote children participation in  eliminating child labour, and sensitising agricultural professionals and other stakeholders with requisite  knowledge on child labour among others. ",561
positive,These contributed to harmonizing government programmes  with the objectives of the NAP.,562
positive,"Similarly, the outcomes under this intervention led to an improved  regulatory framework and institutional development for the elimination of child labour, which was a pillar  in the ARISE global objectives. ",563
positive,"Although project reports5 , teachers and community members the team  spoke to, indicated that children previously in labour had enrolled back to school, lack of baseline values  denied the project to systematically measure the gains in this respect. ",564
positive,"Under the immediate objective 2 for Malawi, the capacity of different national and local authorities was  enhanced.",565
positive,Training of the CCLCs on identification of children in child labour and at risk of falling into child  labour was central in this objective as these continued to play their role in the community.,566
positive,"Establishment  of the CBSOCs, as one stop shops for withdrawn children, was strategic and worked well in equipping  youth with skills to earn a living.",567
positive,Those that the team met were happy to be earning better incomes in  better environments as compared to the time when they were in child labour.,568
positive,"Groups supported with IGAs portrayed immense potential for growth and some had already gained  significant mileage in expanding their venture—a pig rearing group in Msambo that had increased their  pigs from 4 to 21, for instance.",569
positive,The  awareness creation across the different stakeholders including the media set the basis for community  mobilisation in the elimination of child labour.,570
positive,This was  achieved through elaborate identification of children in labour and those at risk of falling into labour  through the use of the community based CLMS. ,571
positive,"Once identified, children would either be reintegrated  back to school or placed in the CBSOCs where they would be taught using the Community Based  Enterprise (CBE) to ensure they catch up with their peers in school once they get reintegrated.",572
positive,"Those  directly reintegrated benefited from afternoon classes established in 8 project target schools with the sole  purpose of ensuring that they receive remedial classes, so that they did not feel out of place due to poor  performance.",573
positive,"These interventions directly contributed to improvement in education services, which bear  the result of reduced child labour across the target communities. ",574
positive,Parents support with IGAs was aimed at giving parents an alternative income to support and maintain  children in school while vocational skills training for youth gave them an alternative source of livelihood  away from child labour.,575
positive,"The downstream efforts were complimented by upstream efforts to improve the  regulatory framework, leading to an integrated approach.",576
positive,The management arrangements for the ILO component were well coordinated with the project receiving  technical backstopping from the Geneva FUNDAMENTALS team and Decent Work Team (DWT) in  Pretoria.,577
positive,"Notably, regular meetings between the ILO and Implementing Partners (IPs)  x improved coordination of activities.",578
positive,"Going by the overall gains registered by ARISE II, it is evident that the project has been able to meet its  aspirations—contribute to the elimination of all worst forms of child labour in agricultural  communities in Malawi by 2018. ",579
positive,"Also, the combination of the different interventions ‘contributed to  elimination of all worst forms of child labour in agricultural communities in Malawi’ which is the  development objective for the project as evidenced in the findings presented above. ",580
positive,"On the whole, it can be concluded that the three projects made solid progress towards their  planned results as these are specified in the three different Results-Based Management (RBM)  systems in the Project Documents (PRODOC).",581
positive,"Nevertheless, the large number of important achievements  provided in Section 3.1 leads to the conclusion that the intervention progress has been very  substantial, with the exception of progress made in Lao PDR where much less activities took  place than in Cambodia and Myanmar.",582
positive,"On the one hand, the majority of beneficiaries of the social security funds are female, specific  social security measures are directed at women only, and in the tourism sector a substantial 30%  of Master Trainers/Assessors is female, while overall the participation of women in the workforce  especially in government organisations is quite widespread.",583
positive,"The ILO/Korea project contributed substantially to policy formulation in Cambodia especially  through its support to the National Employment Policy (NEP), but less so in Myanmar although  the setting up of the National Tripartite Dialogue Forum (NTDF) by the ILO Liaison Office (LO) is  an important step towards this goal.",584
positive,"In all countries there are clear connections between the three  projects and the respective Decent Work Country Programme’s, DWCP (see Annex 7). ",585
positive,"The  ILO/Korea project also contributed substantially to capacity building in Cambodia and to a lesser  extent in Myanmar, while it was in particular appreciated by many stakeholders to learn-while- working together with experts, consultants, staff, etc.",586
positive,"The Government Organisations (GO) interviewed in the different CLM countries plus Vietnam  (CLMV) are generally very satisfied with the quality of the specific outputs in the projects and have  clearly used the tools and practices developed, and this applies even to Vietnam where the project  was terminated in late 2017.",587
positive,"The ILO/Korea projects have generally more focussed on the GO  than on Employers’ Organisations (EO) or Workers’ Organisations (WO), although they have  clearly participated in selected activities, and sometimes even took the lead in certain activities  under the ILO/Korea projects. ",588
positive,"For the CLMV countries and/or the region of the Association of South East Asian Nations  (ASEAN) the support provided through this partnership is quite important, not only for the  countries involved and for the region, but also for the progress made in the different areas  supported.",589
positive,"In view of the substantial number of achievements made by the three projects, it is not surprising  that the main project counterparts are generally very satisfied with the support received by ILO  and the Republic of Korea (ROK).",590
positive,The long-standing partnership contributes to this feeling of  satisfaction as does the continuity in the activities undertaken over several partnership periods. ,591
positive,The Government Organisations in all four countries are generally satisfied with the  Management Arrangements.,592
positive,"The Programme Framework was revised following the 2013 evaluation of the partnership and this  led to a more efficient allocation of resources in the current phase by changing from an annual to  a three-year budget cycle, and by a more focussed approach (i.e. less geographically scattered  and more thematically focused) which was appreciated by most stakeholders. ",593
positive,"The involvement of the EO and WO in the activities of the  ILO/Korea partnership has differed between the three projects, but generally they have been  involved in the implementation of projects through tripartite fora, for example the Regional Skills  Technical Working Group (RSTWG), based in Bangkok, the National Social Security Fund  (NSSF) in Cambodia, the National Skills Standards Authority (NSSA), the Social Security Board  (SSB) and the National Tripartite Dialogue Forum (NTDF) all in Myanmar, as well as the Lao  National Advisory Chamber for TVET and Skill Development; and sometimes they have been  involved also more directly, such as their participation in Myanmar in developing the Law on  Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) from the beginning, the cooperation between the  Myanmar Engineering Society and the Asian Welding Federation (AWF), and the involvement of  WO in the OSH awareness campaign of the Factories and General Labour Laws Inspection  Department (FGLLID) of the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population (MOLIP) in Myanmar.",594
positive,"Generally, the delivery of core services and the communication with ILO were considered effective  by the main stakeholders.",595
positive,The contributions of the lead specialists and the experts of the ILO  Decent Work Technical Support Team (DWT) were considered of good quality. ,596
positive,"The two Korean experts on loan from the Korean Partner Institutions, COMWEL and  KOSHA, were involved in particular in different capacity building activities which have been  appreciated very much by the stakeholders.",597
positive,"All stakeholders interviewed agreed that the ILO/Korea projects clearly delivered value for money,  and that the resources have been allocated strategically and efficiently to achieve the intended  results.",598
positive,The resource use has been judged as quite efficient especially also compared to a  relatively limited budget per project per country.,599
positive," In addition, cost-sharing with other projects has  been considered as positive. ",600
positive,"On the whole, therefore, the key stakeholders are positive on the  delivery of value for money, and they indicated that more resources are indeed needed, and  specific proposals have been made by the respective counterparts in the three projects (see  Section 3.3).",601
positive,"Concerning costs involved to enhance gender equality, this does not seem a major issue, as most  of the efforts involved persuading women to join in project activities which they mainly seem to  have done without hesitation.",602
positive," In addition, an important gender issue was the composition of the  membership of the NSSF in Cambodia and the SSB in Myanmar; in both cases, the majority of  the 1.4 million and 1.15 million respectively were women, which is the more important since  international research studies have indicated that women spend much of their income on the  immediate needs of the entire family than men tend to do.",603
positive,Various strategies have been put in place in Cambodia and Myanmar to ensure the continuation  of mechanisms/tools/practices provided by the projects once the support from the project ends  (‘exit strategy’).,604
positive,"While in Lao  much less activities were implemented systematically, it contrasts with Vietnam which can be  considered as a case in point of sustainability as the government is in the process of integrating  the products of the partnership after the ILO exited. ",605
positive,"On the whole, the ILO/Korea projects do concern a real Partnership Approach in  the sense that the multi-country approach enhances working together and learning together, with  a focus on knowledge sharing.",606
positive,The three projects are considered by many stakeholders as relevant and very timely in the current  state of development of their respective countries.,607
positive,"The overall impression acquired during the  interviews is that the Government Organisations, in particular but not exclusively the ministries of  labour, have taken clear ownership of the activities implemented under the ILO/Korea partnership. ",608
positive,"With respect to the employers’ and workers’ organisations, this is generally much less the case,  although especially the EO have shown ownership in selected activities as discussed in the  above. ",609
positive,"In conclusion, therefore, the three projects have been very effective in establishing and  fostering national ownership among GO, but much less so among EO and in particular among  WO.",610
positive,All (40 of 40) interview groups felt PRD’s community awareness-raising and  mobilisation work was relevant to current community needs. ,611
positive,Nearly half of the community members interviewed had been involved in  the planning and design of activities.,612
positive,PRD activities are generally aligned with the traditional comparative  advantages of Consortium members.,613
positive,82% of interviewees felt that the community empowerment component of  the project has been effective.,614
positive,"However, PRD has  also been facilitated by a couple of significant enabling factors, the most  important of which has been strong civil society participation.",615
positive,83% of interviewees think that results thus far can be sustained.,616
positive,"PRD has a strong focus on ensuring a conflict sensitive approach and has  established both formal and informal mechanisms to investigate,  understand, and monitor sensitivities in areas where it works.",617
positive,"Internal Labour  Standards, however, are directly addressed in the programme.",618
positive,PRD is strongly aligned to the empowerment needs expressed by communities. ,619
positive,It is also aligned to the priorities of the EU.,620
positive,"The  exception is activities under SO3 which appear to have the highest chance for  sustainability, in part due to the strong design addressing sustainability from the outset.",621
positive,"PRD has had a strong focus on ensuring a  conflict sensitive approach and has succeeded in establishing mechanisms to investigate,  understand, and monitor sensitivities in areas where it works.",622
positive,"Emerging Good Practice: The “community infrastructure projects” under SO 3 stand out as a  particularly well designed activity that promotes the use of local labour and resources; carefully  considers conflict-sensitivity, gender, and sustainability issues; and helps provide incentives and  “entry points” to establish relationships and pursue more sensitive activities under SOs 1 and 2.",623
positive,"The project successfully applied the strategies of coordination, harmonisation and  capacity strengthening",624
positive,The timeframe of 3 years was sufficient to complete the objective of enhancement of  GOB enforcement of fire and general building safety laws and regulations,625
positive,Other stakeholder initiatives were taken into consideration although there was some  overlap with the RMGP which was managed during implementation,626
positive,Results based design was used although no actions were planned to enable workers to  play a role in promoting OSH (as this was not within the scope of the project),627
positive,However the  overall approach was a sustainable one.,628
positive,A major achievement is the harmonising of standards.,629
positive,The main unplanned output is a communication strategy and the projects switch in  emphasis from DIFE to FSCD because of overlap with the RMGP.,630
positive,Costs of outputs were considered cost efficient.,631
positive,"Good support was received from the ILO RMGP, CO & Geneva. ",632
positive,The project responded to the needs of the primary beneficiaries and the overall outcomes  are relevant.,633
positive,The working environment in RMG factories has improved as immediate hazards have  been identified.,634
positive,Mainstreaming has raised awareness of safety among stakeholders.,635
positive,The No. of casualties due to fires has decreased – thanks to the effort of all stakeholders. ,636
positive,The project has provided a foundation for inspections to improve.,637
positive,"Regulatory bodies have been provided with tools, standards and processes that can be  scaled up as well as replicated in other industries. ",638
positive,The No. of inspectors has increased.,639
positive,Recommendations made in the USDOL mid-term evaluation have been adequately  addressed by the project.,640
positive,However the tripartite role of the project in  bringing about consensus is appreciated.,641
positive,"The project, collaborating with RMGP, has demonstrated good practice in developing  a system for carrying out preliminary assessments and subsequent steps.",642
positive,"Managed from ILO Geneva, the project had global, national and migration corridor  focused elements under a strong gender and workers rights focus. ",643
positive,The GAP-MDW project fits with ILO initiatives such as the ILO office wide Decent Work for  Domestic Workers Strategy; the ILO Fair Migration Agenda; and the ILO Fair Recruitment  Initiative. ,644
positive,"Four technical departments (MIGRANT, INWORK, SAP/FL and ACTRAV) at ILO  headquarters were involved.",645
positive,It aligned with two Outcomes of the Programme and  Budget 2012-15. ,646
positive,The International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF) was an associate of the project and  they developed a global electronic knowledge platform.,647
positive,"Another associate was the International  Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) who launched the ‘12 by 12’ campaign in partnership with  IDWF/IUF and others, and with IDWF host the ‘My Fair Home’ campaign.",648
positive,"Operationally the GAP-MDW project linked to projects that worked on combating trafficking  or safe migration (such as the ASEAN Triangle project, the GMS Triangle Project, PROWD,  Work in Freedom) and worked closely with UN Women in Argentina.",649
positive,In fact UN Women and  OHCHR were official partners to the project along with the trade union KSBSI in Indonesia.,650
positive,"The  strong collaboration with and between ITUC and IDWF, and the technical assistance provided  to IDWF to support their founding congress were effective for global strategies to improve the  organization of MDWs.",651
positive,"Many regional, bi national and tri national workshops took place in  the 5 migration corridors and beyond, to develop strategies, build alliances and move forward  the agenda for domestic workers. ",652
positive,"An inter-regional knowledge-sharing workshop in  Madagascar was reported as particularly effective with ILO playing an excellent facilitating  role amongst constituents and others, and an emphasis on labour agreements between  regions and countries. ",653
positive,"These events allowed for countries to learn from each other, and to  understand the international context under which MDWs are placed.",654
positive,National stakeholders  also used research findings to strengthen their engagement with government. ,655
positive,For example a  study contributed to discussions around lowering this age ban in Nepal. ,656
positive,"Another achievement was the quantitative statistical module included in the Zimbabwe  Labour Force Survey, which provided a detailed profile of the flows of migrant workers. ",657
positive,"A range of information guides, newsletters, booklets,  and 4 videos (one through OHCHR) were produced.",658
positive,Notably both the ITUC-IDWF-ILO guide for  collective bargaining and the information ‘passports’ (for domestic workers as they travel)  were reported to provide useful and practical information.,659
positive,"When disseminated and widely  referenced in other initiatives, these tools should continue to enhance awareness of social  partners so they can advocate for MDWs.",660
positive,"The three vocational training skills manuals  developed in Argentina to professionalize workers who care for the elderly, children and  housework are operational, and are already being further adapted for migrants in refugee  situations, and will be piloted in 2017 in Jordan, Lebanon and in Egypt.",661
positive,"In Argentina, with new legislation passed in 2015, it was reported  that a relatively higher number of MDWs enrolled for social security. ",662
positive,"However in Lebanon, innovative pilots were put in  place with bank employees, which are expanding further through ILO projects currently under  negotiation.",663
positive,"In Malaysia, a code of conduct was developed through a consultative process  with employers, and launched in March 2016.",664
positive,Research in South Africa and Malaysia also  provided useful insights on how employers view MDWs. ,665
positive,"In Argentina, employers were  encouraged to register their domestic workers. ",666
positive,"Generally, with some exceptions questionnaire respondents for the evaluation were positive  about the GAP-MDW project, considering activities to be worthwhile, and mentioning those  they particularly appreciated. ",667
positive,"Many stakeholders interviewed were appreciative of the  support from the EU, which allowed for a spotlight MDWs via ILO and partners. ",668
positive,"In line with ILO’s mandate, the GAP-MDW project strove to reach MDWs through partners,  encouraging trade unions to represent this category of worker with IDWF reaching out  through their electronic platform.",669
positive, For example SADSAWU in South Africa are pioneering approaches to reach  more migrants.,670
positive,Another approach was building the capacity of domestic  workers unions.,671
positive,"In conclusion, the GAP-MDW project allowed for an exclusive opportunity to research and  focus on the migrant domestic workers domain.",672
positive,"If disseminated widely, and packaged in  discrete policy briefs, the Global Report on Migrant Domestic Workers will be significant for  driving policy advice and change, as it draws on many experiences across the globe.",673
positive,The need for a focus on MDWs  themselves has been fully recognised as the most sustainable approach for collective action  to build advocacy approaches.,674
positive,The relevance of the Community Stabilisation Programme (CSP) is confirmed by this  evaluation throughout the three phases. ,675
positive,"All interviewees, including beneficiaries, praised  the CSP programme in that it responds to a top priority. ",676
positive,"The CSP programme has made improvements over the three phases, while maintaining the  same implementation modalities.",677
positive,The initial programme design and implementation was relevant to the needs of the target  population. ,678
positive,CSP is implemented in every municipality that has a significant minority  population and is valued by authorities at local level.,679
positive,CSP is relevant to both non-displaced minorities and returnees as it addresses two  essential drivers of stabilisation: access to essential services and livelihood.,680
positive,"CSP provides a  strong contribution to viable and qualitative return, especially in support of the EU- Return and Reintegration Kosovo programme. ",681
positive,"Given that there are few other projects operating in the municipalities where minorities form a  significant presence, the relevance of CSP is even greater.",682
positive,All MOCRs interviewed pointed  out that cooperation with IOM is exceptional and that CSP implementation is a model of  intervention. ,683
positive,"CSP Community projects have allowed municipalities to improve and create new amenities  for all community members (often multi-ethnic in nature) and have supported a wide range  of social, educational, cultural and environmentally relevant interventions. ",684
positive,CSP individual grants have contributed to the preservation of traditional cultural activities  and business practices which existence is otherwise at risk of disappearing. ,685
positive,The targeting is relevant and inclusive: The beneficiary assessment and selection process is closely involving local institutions from the very beginning.,686
positive,This process is thorough and  qualitative and ensures both inclusivity of vulnerable candidates while retaining only those  with adequate capacity and verified willingness to succeed.,687
positive,"The Criteria are important and relevant, however, the right targeting requires experience and  case-by-case evaluation. ",688
positive,The value of assistance is relevant though flexibility is required. ,689
positive,"The distribution of CSP I, II, III resources has been fairly balanced among ethnic groups and  geographic locations.",690
positive,The CSP programme has demonstrated a remarkable level of effectiveness: 100% of  beneficiaries visited are effectively running stable business and 100% of community  projects are regularly used by the communities. ,691
positive,"CSP has produced verifiable, durable and substantially positive changes in the lives of  vulnerable minority communities. ",692
positive,Start-up businesses are generating a livelihood for the  individual families despite challenging business/trade environment. ,693
positive,The inclusive cooperation applied by IOM with key central and local-level partners in the  implementation of both CSP and RRK creates greater effectiveness. ,694
positive,"CSP has learned from  and improved the implementation over time, developing innovative support such as  community businesses.",695
positive,The future of CSP improvement is to be inspired from IOM project  team’s wealth of field experience and knowledge. ,696
positive,"CSP coordination & cooperation have been very effective at the Strategic level between  EU, MCR and IOM. ",697
positive,This has facilitated the Operational level collaboration that has been  equally performing. ,698
positive,CSP efficiency is strong as CSP I & II have exceeded objectives both quantitatively and  qualitatively. ,699
positive,CSP III is also on the way to reaching objectives.,700
positive,"Efficiency is, on the first place, owed to human performance: The same CSP staffs are  there from day one: individual and team dedication, professional attitudes are the ingredients  without which no such results could be achieved. ",701
positive,"There appear to be no better cost-effective alternative to the current CSP implementation as  its success is the result of the quality of beneficiary selection, assessment, monitoring and  support.",702
positive,But this is the price of  success.,703
positive,The effective coordination of CSP activities at central and local level has certainly contributed  to the efficiency of implementation. ,704
positive,The permanent field presence of CSP team is a strong  element of efficiency as it did provide essential monitoring of and support to beneficiaries.,705
positive,"Having one implementing partner for all CSP phases proven a far more efficient choice  than various implementing agencies as the same individuals who have built experience,  knowledge, trust and close cooperation have stayed on from CSP I. ",706
positive,"CSP field-intensive approach is efficient and ensures quality of beneficiary assessment, and  selection.",707
positive,Calls for Individual Project proposals are ensuring an effective outreach to minority  communities in need. ,708
positive,Impact is strong quantitatively (with CSP objectives exceeded) but also qualitatively with  CSP often been referred to as the “best project”. ,709
positive,"Indirect impact is also impressive, as CSP has provided a vital link between  beneficiaries to facilitate their business prospects where beneficiaries can produce and sell  their produce to appropriate markets, including international markets. ",710
positive,The formal  registration of businesses has played a key role in establishing beneficiaries as credible  private sector actors. ,711
positive,CSP and partners have provided real solutions for families and helped to create an  environment more conducive to return. ,712
positive,Impact is maximised when combined with RRK  IG or DRC assistance for returnees and when combined with Municipal funds for Community  Projects.,713
positive,Sustainability is very strong and has been witnessed by the evaluators.,714
positive,"Different levels of sustainability are observed across small businesses:  • “Essential” businesses: Stable and generate, sufficient income to cover essential  needs plus some savings. ",715
positive,"“Solid” business: Business generating steady income, covering all essential needs  plus profit. ",716
positive,“High potential” businesses: Business” with high expansion potential. ,717
positive,"CSP has created strong opportunities for minority communities to enjoy the following rights,  in an effective, visible and measurable manner:  • Rights to employment ",718
positive,All female-run businesses are running strongly and performing outstandingly: They are  performing strongly and have placed women on equal ground with men. ,719
positive,IOM has actually been addressing the integration or re-integration challenge through its RRK  programme and the stabilisation challenge through CSP.,720
positive,SP Returnee business has proven  equally successful to non-displaced beneficiaries.,721
positive,"ith 100% of successful returnee and  8  IDP beneficiaries, CSP has proven its capacity to adjust to a more vulnerable target group  while helping return and reintegration programme in achieving sustainable objectives.",722
positive,CSP programme design has clearly taken into account the impact on the environment that  projects may have. ,723
positive,Small business owners have developed practices respective of  environment and healthy (with the production of organic food).,724
positive,Visibility is strong.,725
positive,“Invisible visibility” has proven very efficient at the field level through  to the “word-of-mouth” with beneficiaries acting as ambassadors of CSP in their community.,726
positive,IPA provides the most relevant tool in that context in that it outlines very clearly the Kosovo  Government and EU-support Kosovo priorities. ,727
positive,There is a strong coherence of CSP with all relevant existing strategies both from the  EU and the MCR side.,728
positive,"CSP has been designed to fully support all Kosovo Government  strategies (MCR strategy 2014-2018) and EU policies (Indicative Strategy Paper 2014- 2020), especially with regards to minority rights and stabilisation. ",729
positive,The strength and scale of CSP results and impact is closely connected to the fact that it has  been a one programme and one agency continued effort from the very beginning. ,730
positive,The evaluation found the CSP job creation to be a very cost-effective operation.,731
positive,"This is even  more the case when considering that, in the isolated context of minority communities, a CSP  individual business means much more than a job created. ",732
positive,"Even though it is not formalised yet as such, CSP has developed a model, shaped over a long  continuous learning and improvement process. ",733
positive,"However, prior to establishing CSP as a  model, the immense field practice knowledge needs to be captured.",734
positive,"Otherwise, there is a risk  of this knowledge being lost when individual leave the organisation. ",735
positive,"The strong impact of CSP, verified over eight years is a strong basis for this intervention to be  qualified as a model.",736
positive,"As explained in the previous recommendation, there is a lot to gain from  modelling CSP as a model relevant to inclusive employment for isolated communities in the  context of Kosovo, and potentially in elsewhere in Western Balkans countries.",737
positive,CSP-support business run by women have performed very strongly and they have provided  concrete opportunities to promote the role and perception of women as capable  businesspersons. ,738
positive,"In a country featuring the highest employment gender gap in Europe, and  where employment generated through small businesses are a rare opportunity, CSP needs to  provide more options to women by including them in a larger proportion of CSP  beneficiaries. ",739
positive,CSP decision to award a second grant (not within the same CSP phase) to business with a  strong potential has proven relevant and positive. ,740
positive,"Job creation categories: The nature of the jobs created by CSP is a crucial indicator, to  describe the impact of CSP",741
positive,CSP has helped create hundreds of business and jobs that are knowingly stable.,742
positive,The evaluation has visited some exceptional minority business and believes those are great  stories to promote and increase the visibility of CSP. ,743
positive,CSP business have impressed for they have set environmentally friendly practices that have  contributed to strengthen the value chain.,744
positive,"In some cases, they have even set informally new  environmental standards and raised awareness with their organic food production. ",745
positive,"The success of CSP has a regional dimension in that it contributes to solving the regional  issue of displacement, return and reintegration.",746
positive,"Thus, the promotion of the CSP model, if  supported with funds adequate to the needs, can be a positive driver of regional stabilisation  of communities. ",747
positive,CSP public call for business grant application have raised a very strong interest and produced  a high number of applications.,748
positive,Changing  the implementing agency and its staff could seriously jeopardize the trust and cooperation  built so far and the future results of CSP. ,749
positive,"The project was found to be relevant, focusing on engagement with the knowledge- based diaspora to support the economic development efforts in the country, which is an  ongoing priority of the Government of Ethiopia (GoE). ",750
positive,"The project was also found to be  moderately effective, mostly or partially achieving all its outcomes and outputs through  stakeholder meetings and the production of evidence-based research.",751
positive,"However, the project was able to  provide the GoE with a mapping survey, a skills/knowledge gap report of local  institutions and a road map for future action.",752
positive,"It also produced a database of 400  diaspora organisations in the United States (US) for consultation, which is currently in  use by the GoE.",753
positive,"Further, a strengthened commitment towards diaspora engagement by  the GoE was witnessed during the project’s timeframe although this could not be wholly  attributed to the project results. ",754
positive,Within these very difficult circumstances the project was managed efficiently with regular  reporting every six months although the significant reduction in financial scope for some  activities was not mentioned in the reporting. ,755
positive,"The project was found to be relevant to the priorities of the GoE, complementing its effort  to implement its Diaspora Policy and engage the Ethiopian diaspora to support the  economic development of the country. ",756
positive,"The project was found to be effective, partially or mostly achieving all its outcomes and  outputs through stakeholder meetings and the production of evidence-based research. ",757
positive,"However, project participants agreed on the  usefulness of the project results and demonstrated evidence of a strengthened  commitment towards diaspora engagement. ",758
positive,The project was managed efficiently in challenging circumstances.,759
positive,The  results achieved were found to be proportionate to the costs expended. ,760
positive,The short-term results of the project were strong although limited by the reduced  scope of the project,761
positive,"The new database produced from the mapping exercise has  already been used by the GoE for diaspora engagement purposes, and the project as a  whole has formed the basis for a joint GoE and IOM proposal. ",762
positive," If the research project outputs (the reports) are  considered as a pilot from which a larger mapping and needs assessment can be  developed, this has the potential for longer-term impact, but will depend upon the next  stage of the project being developed. ",763
positive,The project was assessed as having a sustainability score of 3 based on its dependence  upon funding for related proposals on diaspora engagement be developed.,764
positive,"The research  outputs have produced valuable information which can be used to support diaspora  engagement projects using data collected from three US states and the health and  education sectors sampled within the country, but this is limited.",765
positive,"However, changes in  the external environment such as the establishment of the Diaspora Agency and  Diaspora Trust Fund indicate a prioritization from the GoE in engagement with the  diaspora and could support the sustainability of the project results such as the roadmap if further attention is given to it. ",766
positive,"The project was found to be relevant and relatively effective, adapting to a very difficult  political context to partially or mostly achieve its outcomes, outputs and activities. ",767
positive,"However, overall the project results were considered as very useful by the majority of  stakeholders, particularly within the current context in which the GoE has prioritized its  interest in diaspora engagement.",768
positive,"The production of evidence-based research supported an improved understanding of the relevance of diaspora mapping to designing diaspora  engagement strategies and produced a roadmap, which if adopted can contribute  towards feeding into knowledge and skill transfer programmes to be designed in the  future. ",769
positive,The project also produced a database of diaspora organisations which is  currently being used for engagement purposes and a springboard for two other  proposals currently being developed with the GoE aimed at diaspora engagement.,770
positive,Portal content is in alignment with the original intent to facilitate access to migration data and provide capacity building tools. ,771
positive,The current Portal content aligns well to target user needs and expectations as identified during conceptualization. ,772
positive,"It provides a one-stop-shop for migration data that is overall useful, comprehensive, timely, and reliable.",773
positive,Visits to the Portal have been steadily increasing since its launch in December 2017 with the most visited sections being Data and Themes.,774
positive,Most of those surveyed or interviewed appear to be finding the content they are looking for on the Portal.,775
positive,"As for user satisfaction with the content, overall again it appears that there is a high degree of satisfaction among the users.",776
positive,The Portal is perceived to be very useful overall.,777
positive,Only 3% of those surveyed or interviewed found the Portal was not useful at all.,778
positive,This is especially positive given that they are among the key target groups.,779
positive,A majority of those surveyed and interviewed (53%) report that they are using the Portal. ,780
positive,"Overall, the project maintained its relevance to identified needs of the GoE. ",781
positive,It was also clearly  consistent with IOM priorities and mandate. ,782
positive,"On the  one hand, the project has produced a number of quality outputs and outcomes. ",783
positive,"Chief among these  are the updated and formally endorsed NS and NAP (though not planned for); a well-organized and  informative Study Visit to Belgium; comprehensive and largely effective trainings to scores of law  enforcement officers, media professionals, and CSOs’ staff; a comprehensive and intensive  awareness-raising and media campaign with clear and strong messages tailored to the target audience;  and, created a conducive working environment for the NCCTIP&PIM’s Technical Secretariat  through refurbishing its premises and providing the Secretariat with considerable resources. ",784
positive,The project also showed an efficient utilization of financial resources and a successful strategy in  synergizing and complementing interventions of other development partners and leveraging non- project resources. ,785
positive,Perhaps the most notable impact of the project are the updated and formally endorsed NS and NAP;  both represent major contribution to the GoE’s efforts in combating trafficking in persons.,786
positive,"The project has also imparted improved knowledge of the complex and multi- faceted issue of trafficking in persons and the current legal framework in Egypt, as well as the NS  and NAP, among scores of law enforcement officers, media professionals, and CSOs’ staff. ",787
positive,The Study  Visit was very informative and is reported to have contributed to the signing of the protocol for the  establishment of a shelter for victims of trafficking.,788
positive,Strong indications are such that the awareness- raising and media campaign was quite successful and delivered effective messages specifically tailored  to the needs and socio-economic-political backgrounds of the diverse array of targeted groups. ,789
positive,The formal endorsement of the NS and NAP has secured their sustainability.,790
positive,"The protocol for  establishing a shelter for VoTs is in itself a milestone, though it remains to be operationalized.",791
positive,"Unintended as it may have been, the direct link and strong working relationship between  NCCTIP&PIM and media outlets that resulted from training media professional continues to serve  the committee’s efforts in raising awareness of and publicizing the issues of trafficking in persons. ",792
positive,The premises of the NCCPIT&PIM’s Secretariat are in good condition,793
positive,"However, the assumption underlying the project design  – that VoTs would benefit from the strengthened prevention and protection framework in the country, as a result of the project – is plausible but dependent on fulfilling this assumption.",794
positive,"Relevance: The project is relevant as it addresses the existing weak border  management, enhanced coordination and collaboration between South Africa and  Lesotho in various trans-border criminal issues including the counter trafficking and  smuggling.",795
positive,It is also compliant with local and international policies and goals.,796
positive,All key  informants reported that the project is relevant and it addressed the needs of  Lesotho and the people of Lesotho. ,797
positive,Effectiveness: The project was effective as it has reached most of the targets as per  result matrix within the set timeframe with key project results being achieved. ,798
positive,Efficiency: The project was efficiently implemented both in terms of operations and  financially. ,799
positive,"Operationally, it was implemented in collaboration with MoHA and a  contracted NGO, and the budget was used efficiently within the approved time  frame.",800
positive,"Impact: While impact cannot be seen at the time of evaluation (as of December 2018  - at the end of the project implementation), it is assumed that combination of the  capacity building training, implementation of the Immigration SOP, and the use of  donated items will lead to the impact after few years.",801
positive,"Sustainability: The project was implemented jointly with Home Affairs, which  enhanced their ownership to ensure sustainability of the project.",802
positive,The government  showed political will to support the project and made commitment to include the  3 project interventions in next year’s budget.,803
positive,"Due to that willingness, it has made an  executive decision that the installed CCTVs in both borders will be the responsibility  of LRA as is the case in other border posts where they are available.",804
positive,Many informants recognised the advantage of having an  international non-governmental organisation (INGO) as co-chair of the SC.,805
positive,"The shelter response in the Governmental-Controlled Area (GCA), has been mostly well targeted  and appropriate, supported by the SC coordination services. ",806
positive,"The SC has been described as the  most effective cluster in Ukraine, with a highly valued information management (IM) system and  country-wide mapping processes.",807
positive,"The SC has also led technical working groups (TWIG),  particularly on shelter winterisation and cash assistance which were essential for harmonising  and standardising the shelter response.",808
positive,Monitoring of cash for shelter activities have shown high  levels of beneficiary satisfaction with the programme.,809
positive,"A number of actors based in the field, including UNHCR, have been running informal shelter  meetings to better coordinate shelter operations.",810
positive,Key SC personnel were fulfilling dual responsibilities for the SC and UNHCR until April 2015.,811
positive,"SC meetings (SCM) have been responding to the needs of SC partners through regular meetings  in Kyiv and ad-hoc regional coordination meetings until the activation of the sub-national hub in  July 2015, based in Sloviansk.",812
positive,The SC Team (SCT) led a number of technical working groups (TWIGs) which were very well  received by SC partners.,813
positive,"These documents have enabled agencies to develop advocacy messages to  donors, government and their head-quarters.",814
positive,"A post-distribution monitoring (PDM) template, for  cash assistance developed by the SC, contributed to consistency in agency reporting and  improved transparency and accountability vis-à-vis the affected population.",815
positive,"Overall, the SC has been valued for the information it produces. ",816
positive,"The SCT has provided capacity building for SC partners, including national non-governmental  organisations (NNGOs) through various forums, TWIGs, SCM and individual ad-hoc meetings.",817
positive,"The  translation of meetings and key documents into English, Russian and Ukrainian has been essential  to allowing engagement with national actors.",818
positive,Overall the SC is perceived as one of the strongest and most relevant clusters of this response. ,819
positive,Every key informant highlighted the strength of the SC compared with other clusters in Ukraine.,820
positive,"The first of their kind, the pilots in both Cairo with Catholic Relief Services  (CRS) and Alexandria with Caritas presented an opportunity to adapt a proven methodology to the refugee  context in order to better respond to protection needs. ",821
positive,"The Mid-Term Evaluation has shown that current Programme interventions have realized positive impacts  to some extent in areas such as skills development, confidence building and communication abilities,  employment generation, business development and income levels.",822
positive,"Though of the gaps identified during the first half of project implementation in Cairo  and Alex, generally the graduation program is appreciated and needed for almost all refugees interviewed  and surveyed to improve their pathways to better lives.",823
positive,The average income earned per person per month increased by about 18% and 27% since joining the  Programme with CRS and Caritas respectively.,824
positive,"The programme has been able to improve the status of the  majority of the participants, lifting them out of ultra-poverty (i.e. earning nothing), and has supported some  participants to surpass the threshold of poverty by earning more than 1800 EGP per month.",825
positive,"For the wage-employment track (WET), 68% and 69% of jobs placement have been achieved by CRS and  Caritas respectively. ",826
positive,"For the SET, 78% and 97% have started up their business with support from CRS and Caritas respectively. ",827
positive,"However, the programme - specifically in Alexandria - has conducted excellent efforts to connect participants to the market through  exhibitions and fairs where they can sell their products; the programme should further capitalize on such  events that are run by Egyptians. ",828
positive,"The case management system and the caseworkers themselves are vital elements to support refugees in  their journey to self-reliance, and are generally seen as key to the success of any Graduation Programme. ",829
positive,"In the case of Egypt, a single refugee is served by more than one case worker including a socio-economic  case worker, an enterprise-based case worker and an employment-based case worker.",830
positive,This approach may  fragment the accountability towards achieving desired results and outcomes for refugees.,831
positive,"The programme has also engaged in re-development  of short-to-medium-term Project Key Performance Indicators to be more specific, time-bound and worth  measuring. ",832
positive,"UNHCR increasingly uses cash based interventions (CBIs) as a preferred modality for delivering  assistance, offering greater dignity and choice to Persons of Concern (PoCs) in line with  UNHCR’s core protection mandate.",833
positive,"In 2017 alone, UNHCR delivered US$150 million through  CBIs specifically aimed at achieving protection outcomes.",834
positive,"The GCA, which is led by  UNHCR, harmonised the different cash initiatives and programmes in Greece into one single  card, delivery mechanism and beneficiary database.",835
positive,MPGs contribute to protection outcomes throughout the continuum outlined in  the theory of change.,836
positive,"The evaluation found that the most highly  reported areas of spending among PoCs were in these areas, and that as such MPGs  were achieving this intended objective.",837
positive,The water needs (drinking and household use) of PoCs living in ESTIA-provided  accommodation are met as part of the comprehensive government response.,838
positive,"However,  for some of those families living in the camps, the provision of water is insufficient and  MPGs are used to supplement this need.",839
positive,"PoCs are able to access the Greek health system for free, and as such are supported in  meeting many of their acute and immediate health needs. ",840
positive,"Children are able to utilise the Greek education system for free, and MPGs facilitate  this access for many by allowing PoCs to purchase supplies and clothes necessary for  school, and pay for transport.",841
positive,"PoCs report that MPGs have helped them generate additional  sources of income by relieving them of their concerns with regard to meeting their  basic needs, and by providing the money required to purchase the necessary clothing  and pay for transport.",842
positive,"However, the provision of MPGs for basic  needs does appear to have contributed to wider protection outcomes by reducing the  employment of the extreme negative coping strategies seen at programme baseline.",843
positive,"The evaluation finds that less than one percent of survey participants reported having  to engage in dangerous or exploitative work, or send underage children to work, and  only three percent reported having to resort begging. ",844
positive,"MPGs contribute to PoCs feelings of safety in Greece, with 75 percent of respondents  stating that cash had contributed to their feeling of safety in some way.",845
positive,"In terms of  the most commonly cited reasons, 43 percent reported reduced tension at home, 42  percent reported reduced tension in community and 43 percent reported feeling safer  in the knowledge that their needs were covered.",846
positive,"Although the inherent lack of dignity associated with the displacement of a family or  household cannot be fully addressed through CBIs, MPGs are viewed by PoCs as a  dignified means of receiving assistance.",847
positive,Seventy five percent felt that it allowed them  to live with more dignity.,848
positive,"Commonly cited reasons were that they did not have to rely  on others for food, and that it allowed them to reduce their employment of coping  strategies.",849
positive,MPGs are the preferred modality of assistance for PoCs. ,850
positive,"When asked if cash allowed  them to make the best choices for their family, the majority of survey respondents  answered ‘somewhat’ or ‘moderately’.",851
positive,The reasons most regularly cited were that it  allowed them to choose their priority and preferred items.,852
positive,"Overall, MPGs do appear to contribute towards protection by supporting the integration  of PoCs with local communities and host populations, due in part to a monthly injection  of over €6 million into the local economy.",853
positive,"Not only do MPGs provide PoCs with the  opportunity to interact directly with locals when they go to shops to purchase food and  other non-food items, they also provide communities (particularly smaller and more rural  ones) with this vital injection of cash.",854
positive,This diminishes negative feelings and resentment  linked to perceptions that PoCs may receive more support than Greek nationals.,855
positive,MPGs were found to support PoC’s feelings of confidence and increased equality when  interacting with vendors.,856
positive,"Forty-four percent of PoCs agreed/strongly agreed that MPGs  had helped them feel more confident when interacting with host communities, and felt  they had contributed to increased feelings of equality with the host community.",857
positive,"The move towards comprehensive distribution of MPGs has been a contributing factor  to the achievement of protection outcomes, particularly when it comes to meeting  basic needs as blanket assistance simplifies the programme and allows increased  coverage. ",858
positive,"Freedom of movement within Greece allows PoCs the choice to remove themselves  from environments which pose a significant protection risk, as well as the freedom  to access markets and services, all of which contribute towards the achievement of  protection outcomes.",859
positive,"Various additional services, including supporting health and education services, are  available to many PoCs at no cost, which is a contributing factor to the achievement of  protection outcomes.",860
positive,"PoCs are entitled to health, pharmaceutical and hospital care free of charge on the same  terms as Greek citizens.",861
positive,"Free access to education enables children to continue their education and engage with  local children, thereby enhancing their ability to integrate. ",862
positive,"PoCs have access to the labour market as employees, or service/work providers, from  the moment their application has been formally lodged and they have received their  asylum seeker’s card.",863
positive,"PoCs are entitled to access adult education and vocational training in Greece, and  this theoretically allows PoCs the first step towards their engagement in livelihoods  activities.",864
positive,"MPGs can be viewed as an appropriate modality of assistance for PoCs in Greece  because the CBI programme design was based on needs and feasibility assessments,  the MPG transfer value was calculated based on the minimum expenditure basket, and  CBI programme activities have remained ‘protection based.",865
positive,"The design of the CBI programme ensures that MPGs were not only a viable, but  welcome, form of assistance for PoCs, NGOs and the government. ",866
positive,The decision to use  MPGs in Greece was based on needs and feasibility assessments conducted by both  UNHCR and a range of other NGOs operating in Greece.,867
positive,This decision ensured that  the protection risks facing PoCs at the onset of the crisis were minimised or completely  mitigated.,868
positive,"Ongoing advocacy for those PoCs who were initially ineligible has meant that,  over time, these groups are also being included into the programme, thereby increasing  the coverage of CBIs and ensuring protection for all.",869
positive,"The MPG transfer value was calculated based on the minimum expenditure basket,  and is sufficient to ensure that PoCs are able to meet their basic needs in the short- term, and as such is adequate to ensure protection within these parameters.",870
positive,MPGs also  allow PoCs the freedom and flexibility to begin covering their medium- and long-term  needs in most cases.,871
positive,The CBI programme in Greece worked closely with protection colleagues to ensure  that protection considerations were incorporated into all elements of the programme.,872
positive,"These initiatives include protection colleagues joining CBI programme activities and the  establishment of a cash helpline, and have ensured that protection cases are identified  and promptly referred, as well as ensuring the CBI programme remains appropriate to  the protection environment in Greece.",873
positive,"The design of the CBI programme was protection-focused, with activities appropriately  designed to ensure that the programme aligned with UNHCR’s protection mandate. ",874
positive,"The programme design provides blanket assistance to all eligible PoCs, thereby ensuring  high coverage.",875
positive,"In line with the objective of the CBI programme in Greece, MPGs are sufficient to allow  PoCs to meet their basic needs in terms of: food, WASH, non-food items including  shelter and clothing, health, and education.",876
positive,They also lead to a reduction in negative  coping strategies in some sectors.,877
positive,CBIs provide a first step towards social cohesion by: increasing purchasing capacity of  PoC populations; injecting cash into local economies; reducing the perception PoCs  as a ‘burden’ on the already stretched Greek social welfare state; and increasing the  opportunity of PoCs to interact with Greek nationals.,878
positive,"Despite noted challenges and areas for improvement, all sub-programmes were able to reach their  targets, and all were reported to be primarily relevant, impactful and effective.",879
positive,The programmes were well  supported by parents and youth who participated.,880
positive,"The success of the programmes is attributed to the  NACCW’s project management abilities, well-trained CYCWs, mentors, site managers, implementing  agents, partners, as well as the focus on the rights of children and youth, their caregivers and the  community. ",881
positive,Isibindi’s specialised approach has been internationally distinguished in  empowering children and young adults to become resilient participants of society.,882
positive,"By September 2018, the adolescent and youth programme had benefitted 31,167 young people over the  age of 14, which exceeded the initial target of 25,000.",883
positive,The Isibindi Adolescent and Youth Development Programme reached and exceeded most of the set  targets on effectiveness. ,884
positive,"Data collection illustrated that the effectiveness of the programme was directly  correlated to the quality of training provided by the NACCW, complemented by the dedication of the  CYCWs to deliver high quality basket of services to OVCY.",885
positive,"The support provided by the NACCW Mentors  and Senior Mentors was also integral to quality programme implementation, alongside the linkages  between home visits and Safe Parks, in enabling CYCWs to identify issues to be addressed among  adolescents, youth and households in need of support. ",886
positive,"Ninety Five percent (95%) of the project staff and main stakeholders (Project Managers and Site  Coordinators, CYCWs and YDFs, Mentors, Beneficiaries and Caregivers) indicated that the whole  programme was highly relevant and important for the needs of youth and adolescents, as well as for the  wider community.",887
positive,The whole programme was rated as highly valuable in strengthening familial  relationships across many households. ,888
positive,"The most relevant sub-components of the programme were the  Home Visits, Safe Parks, Radio Programme, MenCare Programme and the Sinovuyo Family Programme.",889
positive,"These sub-components were particularly relevant in addressing the needs and interests of youth,  caregivers and families, generating maximum interest and having a significant impact.",890
positive,"Based on the findings, the programme broadly made a positive impact in the lives of adolescents, youth,  caregivers and families. ",891
positive,"Dedicated and passionate Child and Youth Care Workers and Youth  Development Facilitators, who are supported by the NACCW mentors, primarily deliver the programme. ",892
positive,"Firstly, the home visits provided through Isibindi AYDP engendered behavioural change in terms of  instilling independence among adolescents and young people, enabling improved self-care, nutritional  intake and enhanced household problem solving and effective budgeting, which was particularly  important in strengthening the resilience of child-headed households. ",893
positive,"From the analysis of the data, it is evident that relationships between CYCWs, YDFs and beneficiaries  facilitated psycho-social support and mental wellbeing for at-risk or vulnerable children, youth and  adolescents.",894
positive,Confirmation was also received that the Safe Parks created a safe space for the  adolescents and especially the youth to engage in recreational activities and develop bonds with fellow  xv peers.,895
positive,"Tuition support provided at Safe Parks bolstered educational outcomes for children, youth and  adolescents, enabling improved matric pass rates, tertiary education access and employability prospects. ",896
positive,"Isibindi AYDP strengthened the lives of many young people, who consistently return to Safe Parks having  completed tertiary education to motivate other youth to continue with their studies. ",897
positive,"Youth empowerment  and life skills initiatives instilled improved understandings of sexual and reproductive health and rights  (SRHR), as well as how to access HIV testing and family planning. ",898
positive,"According to project staff and families  (CYCWs, Mentors, YDFs, project managers and site coordinators, beneficiaries and caregivers), the  knowledge imparted in the Adolescent and Youth Development Programme (AYDP) inter alia reduced  teenage pregnancies across all sites. ",899
positive,"Youth empowerment programmes, coupled with the MenCare programme for fathers and the Sinovuyo  element for parents, reduced incidents/instances of abuse and gender-based violence in the communities  within which Safe Parks were located.",900
positive,"Sinovuyo was evidently important in improving communication  channels between parents and children, while also emboldening caregivers to spend more quality time  with their children and speak more openly about sensitive issues.",901
positive,"MenCare was, in certain instances,  principally impactful in shifting harmful patriarchal values and empowering some men to engage in caring  for their wives and children as well as contributing to household chores.",902
positive,"The Youth Empowerment, MenCare and Sinovuyo programmes,  targeted gender equality at community level and this produced encouraging results.",903
positive,"Whereas young  women were empowered, men were sensitised about gender-based violence and equality issues. ",904
positive,"The Siyakhula Substance Abuse initiative provided early intervention and response to prevent and lessen  the harmful impact of substance abuse among children and youth, enabling rehabilitation, access and integration back into schools for youth who had dropped out. ",905
positive,"Regardless, a few  success cases of rehabilitation were reported.",906
positive,"The Radio Programme pilot initiative was exceptionally  impactful in facilitating youth empowerment and development, by providing a platform for youth to  express their ideas or concerns and concurrently interact with their local communities through the media  outlet.",907
positive,"This programme sub-component was thus acutely important in strengthening the self-esteem, self- confidence and employability prospects of the youth involved. ",908
positive,"The Isibindi AYDP has broadly generated a sustainable impact in terms of the behaviour and attitude shift  of beneficiaries, in cases where there was no cooperation and buy-in from the parents and youth. ",909
positive,"n  addition, a few specialised programmes have continued since the project was completed in September  2018.",910
positive,"Despite these challenges, the Safe Park programme hub will, depending on the availability of resources,  continue to fulfil the needs of beneficiaries and the community, remaining a safe place for children, youth  and adolescents to study, play and gather after school.",911
positive,"During data collection, all partners with whom UNICEF worked  directly to deliver the AYDP programme namely, NACCW, DSD, Clowns Without Borders and Sonke  Gender Justice, indicated that UNICEF functioned as a strong partnership in providing regular and timely  guidance and coordination of meetings, as well as fulfilling an effective oversight role. ",912
positive,"UNICEF facilitated effective coordination, funding allocation and the convening of partners, to deliver  optimal project management of the AYDP.",913
positive,Programmes are more successful if a multidisciplinary approach is adopted; ,914
positive,The ownership of the programmes by the entire community is of paramount importance; ,915
positive,"The strength of the initiative is that it brought different stakeholders together on the right of  education of the Syrian children, and UNICEF managed to mobilize resources and partnerships. ",916
positive,The Back to Learning initiative provided much needed support to the education sector in  terms of provision of supplies and light rehabilitation of the many crisis affected schools.,917
positive,"Over the  years management, coordination, and monitoring systems of the Back to Learning initiative have  continuously improved.",918
positive,UNICEFs position as co-lead of the education sector and its network of implementing partners  has enabled efficient coordination of the initiative.,919
positive,"The evaluation finds that overall, the population receives information about schooling directly from schools and the directorates of education and is aware of the benefits of education in general.",920
positive,It is time well invested to enhance the chances of learning systematically. ,921
positive,Monitoring the situation and relevance of the response and adjusting accordingly is essential  for making sure UNICEF addresses the needs of the affected population and build strong cases for  donor support.,922
positive,"The Back to Learning initiative is in line with national priorities, international commitments  and the priority of the Ministry of Education, and UNICEF.",923
positive,"Therefore, the overall initiative and in particular the rehabilitation  and provision of supplies were relevant and appropriate. ",924
positive,The education section led systematizing of the intervention has improved relevance within  the available political space. ,925
positive,The monitoring system was strengthened and integrated over time especially at the activity  and output levels.,926
positive,Coordination between different departments and integration of monitoring and analysis has  improved over the years and especially with the arrival of the information management officer. ,927
positive,Output level results have been largely achieved.,928
positive,UNICEF managed to reach children in identified vulnerable areas and supports them to go back to school.,929
positive,External coordination has been successful with the internal coordination having scope to  improve to harvest synergies between sections and partners. ,930
positive,"From July 2012 through July 2017, UNICEF provided  life-saving water and sanitation resources under these difficult conditions for approximately  400,0001 . ",931
positive,"In July 2012, UNICEF was the only organization in Jordan that had the resources, capacity,  and institutional commitment to take leadership of the WASH response related to the Syrian  refugee crisis.",932
positive,It expanded to include  services for water-deprived Jordanian host communities that were resource constrained  before the crisis and were further burdened by the crisis.,933
positive,The WASH programme’s scope also  grew to provide urgent WASH services for refugees living in the border settlements at  Hadalat and Rukban.,934
positive,"The emergency response required quick and flexible decision making  and efficient utilization of scarce resources, which UNICEF successfully performed. ",935
positive,"Overall however, the programme provided an effective response  in line with its core mission, providing life-saving WASH services in response to the Syrian  refugee crisis.",936
positive,It has also increased efficiency and worked to ensure coverage of vulnerable  populations.,937
positive,Two difficult achievements in a dynamic and complex environment.,938
positive,UNICEF dealt with these obstacles while implementing a  complex WASH programme and serving as a conscientious steward of its donors’ resources  and interests. ,939
positive,Relevance: In camps and settlements interventions were relevant and appropriate in terms of  meeting rapidly changing WASH needs of targeted populations under difficult circumstances. ,940
positive,"UNICEF maintained  programme relevance during the winter storms, outbreaks of illness, and other obstacles to  smooth management (such as trucker strikes) that arose throughout the 2012-2017 period. ",941
positive,"During 2012 and 2013, UNICEF determined needs by estimating the quantity of water,  sanitation services capacity, and numbers of facilities that people displaced by the Syrian  civil war required at transit centers and in Za’atari, King Abdullah Park and Cyber City. ",942
positive,"In  this period UNICEF designed and implemented water and sanitation service options and level  of services based on its analysis of the dynamic emergency response context, opinions of  partners and other stakeholders, and the resources it had available.",943
positive,UNICEF has made crucial improvements to water and wastewater infrastructure in host  communities and informal tented settlements. ,944
positive,"Effectiveness: In the provision of equitable WASH services and dissemination of WASH messages in the four camps, the WASH programme achieved high levels of effectiveness for  the targeted population across all years. ",945
positive,"The programme also very effectively supported the  WASH sector through technical support to the MoWI, as well as National WASH in School  Standards.",946
positive,"Government officials at the MoWI and WAJ reported satisfaction with the WASH  programme’s contribution to planning documents, strategies, and policies.",947
positive,UNICEF’s  achievement included successful coordination of the WASH sector from the camp to the  national level.,948
positive,The programme met its targets under each of these activity areas.,949
positive,Efficiency: The WASH programme worked continuously to improve the efficiency of its  operations. ,950
positive,"As an example, the evaluation team estimates that between 2013 and 2016, the  cost of delivering water to refugees in the camps dropped from 3.34 Jod/m3 to 0.24 Jod/m3 .",951
positive,The programme made similar efficiency gains in sanitation services and solid waste  collection.,952
positive,"Other Innovations led to more efficient coverage and management of services,  such as introducing a voucher system for contractors performing desludging that made them  accountable to camp residents and reduced potential corruption.",953
positive,Sustainability: UNICEF has done everything possible to ensure that its interventions are  long-lasting and that mechanisms are in place for their operation.,954
positive,"Examples include  organizing WASH committees to oversee water access and hygiene promotion, constructing  systems out of durable materials, and implementing messaging campaigns for hygiene  promotion and water conservation.",955
positive,UNICEF maintains initiatives that monitor coverage in the  camps and works with partners to ensure vulnerable populations receive necessary services.,956
positive,"These initiatives work specifically to monitor services to people with disabilities, identify  people who meet UNICEF’s vulnerability criteria, and ensure that interventions target  vulnerable people and households. ",957
positive,Coordination: UNICEF greatly minimized duplication of services and service gaps in  camps.,958
positive,Its role as WASH sector lead allowed it to assign sectors of Za’atari to the  responsibility of partner organizations and to set standards among those organizations.,959
positive,It  created similar standards and management arrangements in other camps. ,960
positive,"As sector lead,  UNICEF implemented mechanisms for coordination in the face of emergencies, such as  winter storms, and established third party monitoring systems that allow for quality and  security incident reporting. ",961
positive,UNICEF partners and GoJ officials that the evaluation team interviewed stated satisfaction  with UNICEF as sector lead.,962
positive,"One partner said that, “UNICEF … always (has) staff in  Azraq.” ",963
positive,A donor said that they were very happy with UNICEF’s coordination and  partnership.,964
positive,"A staff member of one partner said, “UNICEF does a very good job of  controlling the work.” ",965
positive,The decisions and actions UNICEF  took in the early days of the programme were crucial for initial inhabitants of Za’atari.,966
positive,"In the  settlements, UNICEF provided water and sanitation services to respond to the settlements’  exigencies.",967
positive,"UNICEF moved quickly and effectively, with clear goals, such as ensuring that  each person had at least 15 liters of water per day.",968
positive,The WASH programme also recognized  that its intervention would have an impact on the larger Ruwaished host community.,969
positive,"To  address that impact, UNICEF rehabilitated the community’s water and sanitation facilities  and provided support to identified vulnerable HHs. ",970
positive,"UNICEF’s installed higher cost and higher quality water infrastructure  at Za’atari, Rukban and Azraq, including the treatment plant for Zaatari.",971
positive,"In each case, a  robust design was followed by very good installation and excellent post construction  operation and maintenance. ",972
positive,This was borne out through the evaluation team’s on-site  investigations. ,973
positive,"In a key-informant interview (KII) with the contractor in Rukban, the  operators noted that UNICEF always purchases high quality equipment.",974
positive,"The result is  operational efficiency, equipment that is long-lasting in the harsh environments, and reduced  maintenance costs, downtime, and interruptions to supply. ",975
positive,These studies  kept UNICEF staff and sector participants informed of changes in the camps and other  locations and assisted the programme in staying relevant and responding quickly to  eventualities.,976

positive,"t was aligned with the priorities of the GoI’s FBNC strategy, and the  specific focus on the SNCU programme.",978
positive,UNICEF also built in flexibility to enable adjustments in its  support to emerging needs.,979
positive,"For example, facilities were supported to provide new services such as  kangaroo mother care (KMC). ",980
positive,"Frequently, the needs were identified directly through high-level analyses of data collected from the SNCUs.",981
positive,"Overall, UNICEF’s approach – working with the GoI and the states rather than leading the programme – resulted in achievement of many of the main intended outcomes, particularly improving access to the SNCUs. ",982
positive,UNICEF support brought renewed focus on newborn health at district level across the country. ,983
positive,SNCUs  were scaled up to 214 of the 228 districts in the six selected states.,984
positive,UNICEF also supported the states  to establish SNCUs in tribal areas. ,985
positive,"The main equipment, installations and essential drugs for newborn care were mostly available in all  facilities with SNCUs.",986
positive,"Also, most SNCUs had integrated the recommended screening for visual and  hearing impairments into SNCU care.",987
positive,"UNICEF was cited as the lead organization supporting the development of SNCUs protocols, and the  protocols were available at almost all the SNCU units.",988
positive,UNICEF partnered with the NHM to strengthen human resource (HR) capacity at SNCUs. ,989
positive,This involved  strengthening institutions as regional centres to train and supervise SNCU staff.,990
positive,UNICEF supported the piloting and rolling out of an online computerised data capture and monitoring  system for SNCUs that allowed real-time reporting of data from each SNCU.,991
positive,The online system served  as the basis for providing regular feedback from the National Ministry of Health to states on care  practices at SNCUs.,992
positive,UNICEF also supported capacity building for deploying the online data system in  states and districts to analyse data and report to state and national governments.,993
positive,"Currently, about 85 per cent of all SNCUs report regularly through this online system, and data are analysed at national  level and reports shared periodically with states.",994
positive,"The proportion of scheduled tribe (ST) members among admissions to SNCUs was higher than was represented in the 0-6 years category in the 2011 national census, suggesting possible improvement  in access to STs (although without data on the relative burden of illnesses and preterm birth rates  among this population group, this finding is inconclusive).",995
positive,"Other components of the newborn health programme, in particular community  mobilisation by ASHAs, are key to addressing social determinants of health, including gender.",996
positive,"In the  six months preceding the evaluation, the SNCU online aggregate data revealed that over 14,300  newborns had been admitted to SNCUs.",997
positive,"UNICEF’s workplans and  reports show efforts had been made to improve quality in antenatal and postnatal care in other areas,  such as developing model labour rooms and developing and disseminating the Maternal Newborn  Health toolkit.",998
positive," In addition, UNICEF supported the government to strengthen antenatal, intranatal and  postnatal care through capacity building; the finalization and dissemination of the Emergency  Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC guidelines); and the strengthening of the maternal death  review.",999
positive,"Regarding nominal expenditure, out of approximately INR 31,620 lakhs  (approx. US$50,016,0002 ) approved by GoI in the Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) for the  FBNC programme, the Record of Proceedings (ROPs) show that only about 63 per cent were spent on  operational costs as most states had already functional SNCUs.",1000
positive,"Other areas such as infrastructure  development, capacity building and procurement of equipment, took a tiny proportion of the state  FBNC budgets.",1001
positive,"It was reported that UNICEF forged partnerships with other  groups and played a convening role in the normative function while involving other development  partners, professionals and professional associations in supportive roles.",1002
positive,"UNICEF supported the state  governments by training, strengthening community monitoring and referrals by introducing an  application to track ASHA’s visits and supervision of babies discharged from the SNCU facilities.",1003
positive,"Overall, UNICEF’s support to the programme was deemed sustainable particularly because of the close  partnership with the GoI during the national health missions and the implementation, as well as the  government’s commitment and leadership.",1004
positive,The fact that no financial support had been provided to  the programme for the last few years by UNICEF and all funding was coming through the government- funded NHM was seen as proof of sustainability.,1005
positive,Credit was given by evaluation respondents to  UNICEF for fostering government ownership.,1006
positive,"UNICEF’s support to the FBNC programme, particularly the SNCUs, has been mostly successful in the  areas which UNICEF was expected to provide support.",1007
positive,UNICEF support increased visibility and  improved national commitment to the FBNC programme. ,1008
positive,"It improved staff capacity for the care of small and sick newborns  in SNCUs in a standardised way, guided by protocols and care guidelines.",1009
positive,UNICEF support ensured the  main equipment and installations were in place in SNCUs.,1010
positive, Interventions have also  been developed for the follow-up of babies discharged from SNCUs.,1011
positive, UNICEF used a model of close  collaboration with the GoI through the NHM to support the programme which enhanced the  sustainability of many core components of the FBNC programme.,1012
positive,"Moreover, the data collection system has  the potential to provide information to improve the quality of programme.",1013
positive,Food Security: We find consistent impacts on food security by the programme for Phase 1  beneficiaries. ,1014
positive,"Impacts range between 2 and 11 percentage point reductions for food insecurity  measures such as skipped a meal due to lack of money (3 percentage point reduction), no food in  household due to lack of money (9 percentage point reduction), and going to bed hungry  (11 percentage points reduction).",1015
positive,"In addition to  reducing food insecurity, the programme also generated positive impacts on food consumption  and diet diversity.",1016
positive," These food category impacts are quite large compared with the food insecurity  impacts, with the programme increasing the number households that ate meat or dairy by 23 and  22 percentage points, respectively.",1017
positive,Roughly half of the beneficiary households ate meat  compared with only 26% of the non-beneficiary group.,1018
positive,Consumption: We find a large impact on per capita food consumption consistent with the  impacts reported on reductions in food insecurity.,1019
positive,"The programme demonstrates impacts consistently across  most food items in the survey including grains (353 Ariary per capita); tubers (95 Ariary per  capita); pulses (83 Ariary per capita); fruit and vegetables (roughly 60 Ariary per capita for  each); and meat, fish, and poultry (99 Ariary per capita).",1020
positive,"Thus, the programme increases diet  diversity and consumption of important food staples such as vegetables, fruits, fats, and proteins  (pulses, meat, poultry, and fish).",1021
positive,We also find impacts on consumption of common non-food items also consistent with other cash  transfer studies.,1022
positive,"The programme increased consumption of soap and personal care products  (146 Ariary per capita and 95 Ariary per capita, respectively).",1023
positive,his result could lead to improved  American Institutes for Research Impact Evaluation of Fiavota Emergency and Recovery  Cash Transfer in Madagascar—xiii health outcomes in the medium-to-long term because hand washing and bathing can greatly  reduce the spread of viruses and bacteria associated with common childhood diseases as well as  flu and cold transmission.,1024
positive,"The programme also increases consumption of matches, lighters,  candles (16 Ariary per capita) and paraffin fuel (128 Ariary per capita).",1025
positive,"We find a decrease in  consumption of charcoal and firewood of 380 Ariary per capita, suggesting that beneficiary  households are switching from charcoal and firewood for cooking and lighting to others energy  sources that may have fewer negative respiratory effects. ",1026
positive,"If so, this result also would suggest that there are environmental and health benefits to the programme. ",1027
positive,"Agricultural Production and Livestock: We do not find an impact on the total value of crops  produced, but do find impacts on some individual items.",1028
positive,"The programme generates a large  impact on the amount of lentils and peanuts grown (106 kg for each), representing a roughly  500% increase over the comparison group.",1029
positive,These results are consistent with the consumption and  food security findings about eating more food with proteins and fat.,1030
positive,"We also find an increase  in the quantity of maize grown by 138 kg, representing a 300% increase over the comparison  group.",1031
positive,"We did not find an impact to the intensive margin for cassava or yams; however, we do  find an impact to the extensive margin for cassava and yams, with a 10 percentage point increase  and 4 percentage point increase, respectively.",1032
positive,The programme generated an effect where 30%  more households produce cassava than non-beneficiaries.,1033
positive,The programme produces impacts to livestock ownership in addition to crop production.,1034
positive,"The  programme increases the number of households that own sheep (19 percentage points), goats  (52 percentage points), and chickens (22 percentage points).",1035
positive,These impacts are quite large given  that between 50% (chickens) and 400% (goats) more beneficiary households own at least one of  these types of livestock than comparison households.,1036
positive,"This result is not terribly surprising though  because the programme started with an initial lump sum transfer that encouraged beneficiaries to  make a larger investment purchase, especially in livestock. ",1037
positive,Resilience: We find that Fiavota improved beneficiaries’ resiliency as defined by the FAO.,1038
positive,Most  of this impact comes from their improved food security and reducing the number of households  who turn to negative coping strategies.,1039
positive,"Beneficiary households are less likely to reduce the  amount of food consumed per meal, reduce the number of meals they consume to cope with  shocks, gather wild food for meals, sell off household goods, or send household members to  another house for meals.",1040
positive,"Together, these effects mean that beneficiary households are more  stable and can pursue positive coping mechanisms to deal with shocks instead of negative ones  that push them further into poverty and create other problems.",1041
positive,Housing: We find that the programme generates large impacts for improved access to a latrine  and healthy sources of lighting. ,1042
positive,"The programme had a 28 percentage point impact on latrine  access, more than doubling the treatment group’s access to a latrine compared with non- beneficiaries. ",1043
positive,This result should help improve beneficiaries’ health over  time given their improved sanitation.,1044
positive,"Similarly, the programme increased the use of non-wood- burning methods for lighting by 22 percentage points.",1045
positive,"We find that the programme increased the likelihood of ever being breastfed for children  younger than 2 years old, with an 8 percentage point impact.",1046
positive,Fiavota will provide additional  insight into how the nutrition support can enhance transfers. ,1047
positive,Child Health: We find consistent and large effects on improved child health across all indicators.,1048
positive,Caregivers report that their children of all ages are in better health than the comparison group by  almost 10 percentage points.,1049
positive,"Similarly, a greater number of treatment children’s health improved  compared with non-recipients.",1050
positive,"Beneficiary households are 26 percentage points more likely to visit  a health centre, representing an almost 100% increase over the comparison group.",1051
positive,"Beneficiary  households also spend more money on child healthcare than comparison households, spending  roughly 30% more.",1052
positive,We find large and consistent impacts for the rest of the child protection indicators except  shoes—almost no child has shoes.,1053
positive, Children in beneficiary households are 4 percentage points  more likely to not engage in economic activity in the last week. ,1054
positive,"More beneficiary children have  access to a blanket and second set of clothing, with a 10 percentage point and 20 percentage  point impact, respectively.",1055
positive,"Parents in the treatment group prefer their son and daughter to marry  at a slightly older age than parents in the comparison group, though the difference is less than a  year for both genders.",1056
positive,Parents in the treatment group also desire their children to complete at  least 2 more years of education than parents in the comparison group desire.,1057
positive,"Children’s Education: We find large impacts on school enrolment, with a 29 percentage point  increase for beneficiary children, bringing them to a 72% enrolment rate.",1058
positive,"Similarly, beneficiary  children attended school more often, averaging 0.34 more days per week than comparison  children at 4.67 days per week.",1059
positive,More beneficiaries report having sufficient funds for  school fees with an 11 percentage point impact.,1060
positive,"We find that beneficiaries have, in general, a positive experience  receiving the transfers with reasonable travel time to access payments at low cost to them.",1061
positive,Perhaps most telling is that 94% report receiving the transfer “without trouble.”,1062
positive,"Regardless of their travel time, almost  everyone reports receiving the transfer without having to pay money (99%). ",1063
positive,Relevance: We conclude that the Fiavota programme was relevant to the stakeholders  responsible for the programme and beneficiaries receiving the programme.,1064
positive,We fine that beneficiary households are more likely to  attend health centres and their children more likely to attend school.,1065
positive,"The Fiavota  program improved households’ resilience and productivity, both of which can contribute to  households’ well-being after the transfer ends.",1066
positive,We find that Fiavota produces  impacts on the primary needs of households after as many as 16 months of implementation. ,1067
positive,"In the social domain, Fiavota generates  large increases in school enrolment. ",1068
positive,It further leads to improvements in the material well-being of  American Institutes for Research Impact Evaluation of Fiavota Emergency and Recovery  Cash Transfer in Madagascar—xvi children in terms of possession of clothes and blankets.,1069
positive,"Indeed the impacts produced by Fiavota are some of the  largest schooling effects reported for any cash transfer programme, whether conditional or  unconditional, at close to 30 percentage points’ impact on enrolment. ",1070
positive,"Finally, in the productive  domain, Fiavota promotes agricultural activity by increasing crop production and ownership of  agricultural assets such as livestock.",1071
positive,"The combination of impacts thus improved the overall  resiliency of households to manage and cope with shocks, an important goal of the programme. ",1072
positive,"Overall, it appears that the programme generates a number of positive impacts across many  important domains, demonstrating that the programme is implemented relatively well in a  challenging environment and that beneficiaries use the transfer in meaningful and successful  ways. ",1073
positive,The fact  that we find consistent impacts across so many different domains and that our matching process  created very strong matches challenges the idea that one missing variable explains everything.,1074
positive,"Instead, there likely would have to be many missing variables for different domains, making this  scenario less likely, yet we cannot rule it out from this study design.",1075
positive,"The qualitative findings reveal that the MCW Strategy was devised to assist the Government and  provincial/regional health departments to effectively utilize the existing public health networks, with a focus on  improved, cost-effective and accessible health care services at the grassroots level for mothers and children, as  outlined in the health policies and plans.",1076
positive,"The qualitative findings highlight the alignment of MCW initiative with health priorities defined at different  levels, including within the framework of the international Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Pakistan’s  National Health Vision and all provincial/regional health policies. ",1077
positive,"The qualitative findings affirm that the MCW Strategy is highly relevant to the national and provincial/regional  health strategies and plans, in terms of achieving improved MNCH services.",1078
positive,"The qualitative data found that the provision of high priority MNCH interventions through the MCW Strategy  helped to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (MMR), the infant mortality rate (IMR) and under-five mortality  and morbidity in Pakistan. ",1079
positive,"The qualitative data affirmed that areas covered by LHWs were selected after thorough planning which  prioritized poor and underserved communities in order to bridge gaps in access to, the availability of and the  affordability of MNCH services. ",1080
positive,The quantitative findings substantiated this by showing that nearly two-thirds  of mothers surveyed (69.2 per cent) identified the availability of free health services as the major driving force  behind their participation in MCW activities.,1081
positive,The qualitative and quantitative data affirms that the initiative was very good at achieving its intended goals. ,1082
positive,"Stakeholders at the federal, provincial and district levels acknowledged that the MCW raised knowledge of  health among mothers. ",1083
positive,"Both qualitative and quantitative data confirms that the MCW awareness campaign equipped mothers with  better knowledge of health care, especially in terms of preventing diarrhoea and pneumonia.",1084
positive,"Greater  awareness also led to an increased number of deliveries in hospitals (67.4 per cent of births attended by  doctors and 12.2 per cent by LHWs), dispelled various cultural misconceptions about vaccines and encouraged  women to get TT shots (91.9 per cent) during their last pregnancy and 77.5 per cent acknowledged that the  benefits of TT vaccinations were properly explained to them.",1085
positive,The MCW initiative similarly raised women’s  knowledge of deworming tablets – 77.7 per cent of mothers reported that deworming tablets were provided  to their children during the MCWs. ,1086
positive,"The key informants from southern Punjab, FATA, GB and Balochistan reported that the MCW initiative’s  implementation was often halted due to various petty logistical gaps and geo-cultural limitations, such as harsh  weather or commutes through hilly/hard/far flung areas, religious and social misconceptions regarding  vaccinations and the iatrogenic implications of the interventions used.",1087
positive,"Overall, the qualitative and quantitative findings reveal that the MCW initiative followed multi-level monitoring  and reporting mechanism at the federal, provincial, district and field levels, though with lacunas. ",1088
positive,"The qualitative data indicates that available human, financial resources and supplies were used quite efficiently. ",1089
positive,The MCW was considered cost-efficient as it utilized most of the existing programme resources.,1090
positive,The synchronization of MCW activities with the existing field work improved the LHWs’ reporting and  communication skills when engaging with beneficiaries.,1091
positive," On the whole, the MCW-led trainings improved the  overall competencies of health staff.",1092
positive,The qualitative findings indicate that most of the key informants agreed to the continuation of the MCW  initiative’s benefits for beneficiaries after UNICEF’s sponsorship of the initiative comes to an end. ,1093
positive,The qualitative data demonstrates that Punjab ran the MCW initiative successfully and independently.,1094
positive,"The qualitative findings reveal that MCWs were an effective approach for improving the MNCH indicators,  strengthening the service delivery system and raising awareness among the communities by using Pakistan’s  existing network of outreach workers.",1095
positive,"The qualitative findings showed that the MCW is beneficial and effective initiative in achieving vaccination  targets, providing deworming tablets and reaching the ‘unreached’ children.",1096
positive,The evaluation concludes that the MCW initiative effectively provided MNCH services to the targeted populations. ,1097
positive,"However, the MCW initiative has the potential to increase health coverage by enhancing community  participation through community mobilization.",1098
positive,"Relevance: The project was relevant in addressing the evident needs of access to clean and  safe water, poor sanitation and hygiene.",1099
positive,"Children in ECD, girls and those with disabilities were particularly affected.",1100
positive,t addressed lower access to water and sanitation for ECD children and  the burden of fetching water for girls which improved their positive school experience. ,1101
positive,Therefore these benefits are likely to contribute to this group  children staying in school. ,1102
positive,The project was also relevant in changing community knowledge and attitudes towards the  importance of latrines and good hygiene.,1103
positive,"Demonstrating the effects of good WASH at the schools, was therefore  having a positive ripple in community perceptions about WASH. ",1104
positive,The policy standard for the distance  of the water point from the school was met in a majority of schools (71.4%). ,1105
positive,At the time of the  evaluation proposed girl friendly toilet designs were developed an awaiting approval.,1106
positive,"Efficiency: While the evaluation did not undertake a cost benefit analysis, the changes brought  about by the project such as increased sanitation facilities, water and hygiene transformed  school experience for learners. ",1107
positive,The quality of support was generally acceptable with beneficiaries and stakeholders  expressing satisfaction.,1108
positive,"Latrines received the highest satisfaction for quality while concerns  were raised on the quality of water from boreholes, leaking handwashing tanks and poor  quality taps on the handwashing tanks. ",1109
positive,UNICEF WASH Section has institutionalised reporting templates for value for money,1110
positive,Partnerships and coordination: The coordination and management structures for the project  were sufficient. ,1111
positive,Ensuring national leadership through existing WASH coordination structures  in implementation was commendable and represented good practice. ,1112
positive,It allowed the project to  access an array of skills and knowledge which enhanced quality of interventions and  timeliness of implementation that would have been otherwise too expensive or challenging for  the project to sustain or achieve had it relied solely on NGO partners. ,1113
positive,"The project made significant  contributions to Millennium Development Goals on access to water and sanitation ensuring all  schools (100%) achieved “Basic Service” from “No Service” for drinking water but only  managed to move less than half (42.8%) of the schools from “No Service” to “Basic Service”  for hygiene. When districts are compared, Binga was the worst affected with all schools not  reaching “Basic Service” for hygiene. ",1114
positive,"In Hurungwe, 50% of schools had reached “Basic  Service” for hygiene while all schools in Mwenezi had reached this level. ",1115
positive,Good hygiene behaviour was high for higher age groups than ECD. ,1116
positive,More boys (89.6%) than  girls (86.8%) were washing hands after toilet use. ,1117
positive,There were some unintended impacts of the project. ,1118
positive,Project boreholes facilitated  establishment of nutrition gardens in schools enhancing agriculture lessons and providing  opportunities for income generation for schools.,1119
positive,Availability of water sources at schools sped  x up the process of building learning blocks thereby enhancing prospects for qualifying the  schools for registration with MoPSE6 .,1120
positive,Sustainability: The strategy of working through existing structures at district level and having  these structures lead implementation enhanced ownership of the project which increased  prospects for sustainability. ,1121
positive,"Community level structures and cadres that included: Water Point  Committees (WPCs), Village Pump Mechanics (VPMs), and latrine builders, all contribute to  building community capacity to operate and maintain water, sanitation and hygiene  infrastructure.",1122
positive,To support hygiene education the project trained two teachers per satellite  school.,1123
positive,"While the project performance varied, it is clear it had a positive impact on transforming school  experience for children by enhancing access to safe water, sanitation facilities and  handwashing.",1124
positive,"The situation before the project was dire, and it brought a welcome relief to  children and communities. ",1125
positive,Relevance of B‐CAP: B‐CAP’s design (including the formulation of the project’s objectives and sub‐objectives  and  outputs) was  found  to  be  highly  relevant  to addressing  the  challenges and  needs  of  its  target  group.  ,1126

positive,"The design process of the initiative has been largely participatory and yielded a design that was able to achieve the initiative’s objectives, building largely on existing policies, programmes and  structures.",1217
positive,"However, as the grant’s resources would not have been adequate  enough to do so, by aiming to improve access and utilization of social services amongst social  protection beneficiaries, the initiative maximized the relevance of the relatively modest budget  available under the grant by fostering linkages – and therewith optimizing returns on investments  – with complementary services.",1218

neutral,"Furthermore, the evaluation found that the ‘basic  needs’ of a given household vary dramatically with the presence of certain vulnerable  groups, like infants, children under 5 and people with disabilities or chronic conditions.",2283
neutral,"The most frequently reported unmet needs were clothing (69 percent), cigarettes (29  percent) and debt repayment (23 percent).",2284
neutral,"Syrians and Palestinians were more likely to  report that MPGs did not meet their basic needs, compared to respondents of other  nationalities. ",2285
neutral,"Nationality, accommodation type and  number of people covered by the card were all found to influence how much additional  income respondents reported needing to spend.",2286
neutral,"Specifically, those spending more  tended to be from larger households and living in flats/houses as opposed to camps.",2287
neutral,"MPGs are primarily being used to meet basic food needs, even for those in catered  accommodation. ",2288
neutral,"Respondents reported spending an average of €220 on food in  the previous month, which constitutes 77 percent of total reported spending, and  represents the highest spend in any category.",2289
neutral,The total expenditure on food increased  according to the number of people per household (with larger households spending  more) and nationality as people from Syria and Iraq reported higher expenditure on  food than other nationalities.,2290
neutral,"The employment of coping strategies to meet basic food needs were frequently  reported, with 70 percent of respondents saying they eat less preferred/expensive  foods once a week or more.",2291
neutral,"The next most commonly reported coping strategies were  reducing the number of meals per day and reducing portion size, which 45 percent  reported doing once a week or more.",2292
neutral,"Less than a quarter of respondents reported  employing water-related coping strategies, such as reducing how often they bathe, or  wash their clothes.",2293
neutral,"Over 60 per cent of respondent reported that hygiene products were one of the top five  household expenditures the previous month, with an average spend of €30.",2294
neutral,"For those  with infants, baby products contribute disproportionately to monthly expenditure, to  the extent that these families exhibit higher employment of negative coping strategies  related to food (reducing portion sizes, reducing meals, restricting adult consumption,  and borrowing food).",2295
neutral,"Health needs vary greatly between  households, and the health needs of families with members who are chronically ill, or  who have disabilities are significantly greater than those without.",2296

neutral,"Those living  in government-run sites who reported spending in this area, spent an average of  the €27 the previous month.",2298
neutral,This evaluation seeks  to understand the extent to which PoCs are seeking additional income (on top of MPGs)  to cover these gaps. ,2299
neutral,"Since  the programme is designed to cover basic needs, once PoCs are generating formal and  regular income above the Greek minimum wage, they become ineligible for cash.",2300

neutral,Socioeconomic status in  country of origin also affects sense of dignity; survey respondents who answered ‘not at  all’ had a higher average annual income than those who answered that MPGs improved  their feelings of dignity ‘very much.’,2305
neutral,Seven percent of individuals  stated that they would prefer to receive vocational training or work in place of other  forms of assistance.,2306
neutral,These barriers may be exacerbated by  the distance PoCs are living from markets (one of their main opportunities to interact  with locals).,2307
neutral,Beneficiaries who lived further from markets/shops were less likely to  report improved relationships with vendors or neighbours.,2308
neutral,A number of internal and external factors influence the ability of the CBI programme to  achieve protection outcomes across the continuum outlined in the theory of change.,2309
neutral,"Because of the complex interplay of needs and vulnerability amongst PoCs, many of  these factors influence the extent to which individuals and households experience the  effects of MPGs on wider protection outcomes differently.",2310
neutral,The contextual factors that  have been identified as most influencing the achievement of protection outcomes are  outlined below.,2311
neutral,"Household location can facilitate or inhibit PoCs from meeting basic needs, and is one of  the most significant factors affecting PoCs ability to realise wider protection outcomes.",2312

negative,"On the other hand, a more  comprehensive economic and social assessment in the newly included communities would have been  valuable to reassess the approach and increase the relevance of the interventions. ",3074
negative,"The evaluation found that the project’s intervention logic was essentially sound, but lacked clear  objectives for local government capacity to support and sustain the approach. ",3075
negative,"Moreover, the expression  of the design in the results framework could have been much more rigorous to enable results-based  monitoring and evaluation. ",3076
negative,"These benefits were extended to some cooperatives in Jaffna and Mannar, but were not seen to the  same extent in the newly supported areas such as the Jaffna islands and the re-settled area of Tellipalai,  which came on board later in the implementation. ",3077

negative,"The newly formed cooperatives are making stable incomes from sales to supermarket chains, but not yet reaching break-even point  without external subsidies to running costs.",3079
negative,The evaluation concluded that the process of support needs  to be more customized and should allow sufficient duration to build cooperatives’ independence. ,3080
negative,"Buyer demand influenced crop selection decisions; however, full value chain studies would have been  useful to potentially expand the benefits. ",3081
negative,"However, some fishing communities targeted remain  vulnerable - the purchasing practice has not yet reached all the cooperatives and some fishing  communities remain highly indebted, suggesting the need for intensified support. ",3082
negative,Women are the major beneficiaries of employment generated in seafood processing;  while there is room for improvement in the quality of jobs in sea cucumber processing.,3083
negative,"The  main gap identified by the evaluation was the lack of an M&E Officer during most of the project, limiting the effectiveness of the M&E system.",3084
negative,The monitoring and evaluation system lacked baseline information  to support systematic comparisons and was under-utilized in terms of reporting and making  management adjustments.,3085
negative,The evaluation observed that the project could have developed a more effective  communications and knowledge sharing strategy towards national replication and scale-up.,3086
negative,As business  enterprises the cooperatives have reached varying degrees of independence. ,3087
negative,Some require little further  external support while others are likely to require more support to reach financial sustainability.,3088
negative,The local government agencies in agriculture and fisheries are  supportive of the cooperatives approach and the Cooperatives Department itself was engaged; but the  project was less focused at the level of government capacity to sustain and expand the overall approach. ,3089
negative,The  indicators described in the PRODOC and LogFrame are not very precise because no actual  numbers are given.,3090
negative,The outputs in itself were clearly achievable but are considered in its totality quite ambitious as  large numbers of outputs (23) and activities (41) were identified in the Log Frame.,3091
negative,Especially in  combination with the quite limited management set-up this has in fact been considered as overly ambitious.,3092
negative,"In addition, this large number of activities suggests a certain degree of fragmentation  of support. ",3093
negative,"However, the impact of the Local Elections in February 2018 and of the aftermath of changing  ministerial structures and key staff was not as such foreseen. ",3094
negative,"Nevertheless, there are a number of  areas that are lagging substantially behind, and these are also listed in Section 3.2.",3095
negative,Compared to most ILO projects the involvement of the workers’ and employers’ organizations in project implementation has been relatively limited. ,3096
negative,"With 23 Outputs and 41 Activities identified in the project design, the complexity of the programme and the sheer number of tasks to be undertaken by the project staff seem to have been  underestimated at the design stage considering that the project staff consists of just one full-time  National Programme Coordinator (NPC) and since June 2017 also of a full-time  Administration/Finance Assistant. ",3097
negative,"Monitoring  and strategizing was well designed to occur at several levels, but unfortunately the  implementation has lagged behind substantially as three of the main fora could not be held  regularly, i.e. the NAC, PAC and NSCRR. ",3098
negative,"In general, it was found that the methodology of implementation was the right one under the  circumstances, but there were substantial differences among the objectives and selected  activities which are discussed in detail in Section 3.3. ",3099
negative,"The durability of the planned results, i.e. in how far these results can be maintained or even  scaled-up and/or replicated by other partners, differs substantially among the various project  components. ",3100
negative,The completion of the Resource Directories for FEDOs and its dissemination to five  districts is another important step for which plans need to be developed for scaling up. ,3101
negative,The  completion of the review of SLBFE’s Sub Policy on return and reintegration needs to be followed  up with monitoring on how it is implemented. ,3102
negative,"For that to happen the monitoring  and evaluation of the direct assistance provided should be substantially enhanced through the  PAC and the NAC in particular, and the strategizing should be enhanced through the development  of an expenditure plan for the remainder of the project duration and through the regular meetings  with SDC as well as with the LM Unit in the ILO country office. ",3103
negative,Certain interventions could have the unintended effect of enlarging the reliance on the technical  and financial support from international organisations as opposed to enhancing ownership and  taking initiatives by national institutions themselves. ,3104
negative,"In any case, it would be beneficial for the LM project to have an ‘exit strategy’ in case assistance  for this particular project will not continue after its completion in February 2020. ",3105
negative,"In the TPRs the link with  the LogFrame is clear at the general Objectives level, but somewhat difficult to establish in detail. ",3106
negative,"However, dissemination seems to have lagged behind somewhat partly because the NAC, PAC  and NSCRR whose members are the key project stakeholders, have not been held for a long  time. ",3107
negative,"Several stakeholders consider  public awareness on issues of LM as an area that needs much more attention, and it could for  example be enhanced through SLMP’s National Media Campaign which is in development.",3108
negative,"However, additional meetings setting out the strategies of the project  outcomes and the prioritization of outputs will be important.",3109
negative,"Reporting has  been adequate and followed the SDC requirements, but more emphasis is needed in the project  for monitoring, strategizing and timely modifications of outputs or activities. ",3110
negative,"The marketing, communications and business strategies were less useful for trade union federations  who were not able to take full advantage of the opportunities offered. ",3111
negative,"Structural issues, such as laws on representivity, low trade union membership in the private sector,  and lack of extension of collective agreements to non-affiliated employers are barriers to free  collective bargaining.",3112
negative,"The project made limited progress in the field of collective bargaining by developing a tripartite action  plan, providing high quality ILO materials to support collective bargaining and made use of specialists  to assist the social partners to improve collective bargaining.",3113
negative,"Nevertheless,  according to interviews with trade unions, the activity schedule was very compressed in the extension  period. ",3114
negative,"However, to date, the capacity  built has only been partially utilised.",3115
negative,Sustainability for the NESC depends on the continued willingness of the MLSP to fund its activities and  on the continued commitment of the social partners to the tripartite mechanism.,3116
negative,For the amicable settlement of disputes there is a mechanism in place and ready for use but it needs  to be utilised to a greater extent to ensure sustainability.,3117
negative,Capacity has been built to improve collective bargaining but structural issues that act as barriers to  sustainable improved collective bargaining remain to be resolved. ,3118
negative,There is no formal sustainability plan although sustainability is predicted to be ensured through a new  externally funded project. ,3119
negative,"The compressed timescale in the closing months of the project led to an overloaded activity  schedule that put pressures on the social partners to keep up with the high pace of the project,  affecting their capacity to maximise the benefits. ",3120
negative,"The value of social dialogue has been increased within the MLSP but there is still work to be  done to disseminate that value across other government departments, notably the economic  and finance ministries.",3121
negative,Multiple structural barriers remain to effective and free collective bargaining.,3122
negative,These barriers  include restrictive laws on the representative status of employers bodies and trade unions;  unwieldy trade union registration procedures; low trade union density in the private sector;  unresolved historic affiliations of trade unions with government; limited membership  democratic influence over trade union decision-making processes; and lack of extension of  sectoral collective agreements to employers not affiliated to EOs.,3123
negative,The lack of a clear sustainability plan is a risk to long term sustainability as project continuation  plans are based primarily on a new externally funded project. ,3124
negative,A single strategy developed for three  trade union federations proved less successful as a capacity-building tool.,3125
negative,"The Employers’ and Workers’ Organisations have been involved in the project from the beginning,  but while Bangladesh Employers federation (BEF) has participated directly in several activities of  B-SEP, the trade unions affiliated to the National Coordination Committee for Workers’ Education  (NCCWE) were much less directly involved.",3126
negative,"It does not include an explicit Theory of  Change (ToC), but the new DWCP for Bangladesh (2017-2020) specified two ToC’s related to  Skills Development.",3127
negative,The numerical  achievements in terms of gender are relatively modest since the average of the results on the 30  targets is 22.4 % women.,3128
negative,"Tripartite issues are, in principle, discussed in the  Tripartite Consultation Council (TCC) which has not been meeting regularly, and the BEF has  recently requested the GoB to reinvigorate it. ",3129
negative,"However, the BEF has been involved much more deeply into B-SEP interventions (e.g. through ISCs, BBDN, PPP and  apprenticeships), than trade unions who have organised themselves in the NCCWE, representing  about five million workers, which is led by a Rotating chairmanship with a rotating secretariat.",3130
negative,"However, the funding rate could be better by predicting earlier to shift funds from one component  to another, which is related to the tendency to consider them stand-alone components.",3131
negative,"However, since the NSDC will be turned into the NSDA and moved to the Prime Minister’s Office  (PMO), MOLE is not currently represented in either the PSC or the PMCC.",3132
negative,"Regarding Impact Orientation and Sustainability, the B-SEP project has made a number of  important inroads, but much progress needs to be achieved as well.",3133
negative,"The secretariat of the NSDC has also demonstrated ownership, while MOLE was  important for the Dhaka Skills Summit and for hosting the NSDC, but its role has decreased in  the past two years. ",3134
negative,"However, it also depends on the capacity to follow up on Project results,  which differs substantially among the various national partners and stakeholders involved.",3135
negative,"By that time, it was a bit late  to implement some of the recommendations, such as a complete revision of the LogFrame.",3136
negative,"Finally, from the experience gained by evaluating the B-SEP Project in Bangladesh in the present  report three Lessons Learned (LL) and our Good Practices (GP) have been compiled as follows: LL1: The project structure with four components leads to stand-alone sub-projects and loss of  oversight in the B-SEP Project.",3137
negative,"LL2: While much progress made in the past five years make a positive story of the government’s  commitment to skills reform, inordinate delays in providing adequate staff and slow  progress on various legislations and on providing dedicated budgets for certain activities,  create challenges for skills reform in gaining momentum.",3138
negative,"LL3: Contrary to the government’s and the employers’ positive response to disability inclusion,  it is challenging to create enthusiasm among them to take concrete steps towards  strengthening gender mainstreaming in the TVET system as well as in the workplace.",3139
negative,"However, more advocacy work at higher  level is still needed before this can be fully  realized.",3140
negative,Awareness of the campaign materials  9999888776-executive 4 was relatively low with an estimated 28% of persons crossing the border at Sarpi and Vale recalling  seeing information about TIP while crossing the border.,3141
negative,"However,  when considering the reports to hotlines indicated in campaign materials, no increase in the number  of calls was recorded.",3142
negative, It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions about the campaign’s effectiveness  as corroborated in the assessment report.,3143
negative,"The project original timeframe of the project was 11 months, but as a result of delays in  coordination of the campaign, it was decided to implement the project over the full timeframe of the  donor contract which was 18.5 months.",3144
negative,"Impact: The overall impact of the project is limited because of the scope of the project, though the  project appears to have moved things in the right direction towards strengthening capacities to combat  TIP. ",3145
negative,"Practice, however,  shows that more efforts are needed to enhance and sustain these mechanisms, especially related to  the incorporation of the labor inspectorate at regional/local levels. ",3146
negative,"As noted by an interviewee, continued efforts will be needed on the NAP objectives of raising  awareness of different aspects of TIP as well as capacity building of professionals to deal with changing  modalities and emerging issues. ",3147
negative,Sustainability: The project’s sustainability varies per component.,3148
negative,"The capacity building component on the other hand was not designed in a sustainable manner as no  institutionalization of the trainings has taken place, but dissemination of information happens in an  informal manner while on the job.",3149
negative,"This may work in certain instances, but the recurring issue of staff  movement is likely to result in loss of experience and continued reliance on external support to build  capacities of professionals working to combat TIP.",3150
negative,"Moreover, there is no institutional training new staff  can avail of, with the exception of a basic training module on TIP within the Police Academy. ",3151
negative,"However, full commitment to prevention efforts is uncertain as concerns related to  potential deterrence to visitors/tourists were named as reasons for not implementing a large scale and  visible awareness raising campaign.",3152
negative,"Some additional measures will also be necessary to ensure  sustainability of project interventions, for instance to ensure continuation and strengthening of the  interagency coordination mechanism and further incorporation of the labor inspectorate into CT  efforts. ",3153
negative,Cross-cutting issues: Gender and good governance were the two cross-cutting issues this evaluation  paid attention to. ,3154
negative,"The project’s design did not adequately address gender, though certain gender  considerations were included indicating the project would incorporate a gender-mainstreaming  approach. ",3155
negative,Attending the event did not improve how well potential migrants self-assess their  knowledge about migration to Europe.,3156
negative,The results are also mixed in relation to the degree to which the campaign affected the perception of specific risks along the migration journey and at destination.,3157
negative,"While the campaign increased the likelihood of perceiving “exploitation” and “expulsion” as key risks, there were no effects, and partly negative effects, on risk perceptions related to “lack of food and water” “sickness” and “ship wreckage/sinking.”",3158
negative,"The campaign, focusing on the risks of the journey, had no effect on perceptions of risks related to the situation in destination countries including “social exclusion”, “discrimination”, “housing” and “unemployment.”",3159
negative,"There was however  room found to improve project theory of change analysis, target setting and budgetting. ",3160
negative,The  contribution to increased technical capacity however appears to have been limited in that the project  had a small target that did not necesarily form a critical mass for impact to be felt.,3161
negative,Independent reports  continue to cite lack of capacity as a gap that still needs to be filled. ,3162
negative,Also the training did not reach the  police and a ToT training after the initial training could have enhanced the caapcity building effort. ,3163
negative,"In terms of efficiency though the project achieved its targets, the evaluation found that the project  took long to complete(nearly double the planned lifetime) . ",3164
negative,It also did not utilize all available budget. ,3165
negative,"There are some challenges in sustaining some results especially skills and knowledge owing to staff  transfers, inadequate numbers trained and lack of competent incountry ToTs. ",3166
negative,The evaluation recommends a deeper ToC based analysis and documentation; find ways to train police  and run a ToT; further resource mobilization for more CT and migrant worker issues programming;  reconsider remote project implementation model in order as it did not appear to have worked well in  this context as well as increasing projects monitoring efforts. ,3167
negative,"Actual expenditures have been rather small in 2016, while those in 2017 and the  first half of 2018 picked up pace only slowly (cf. Table 1).",3168

negative,Verifiable improvements in ecological status cannot be measured without an  environmental survey. ,3170
negative,"Being a pilot/test/research project (see project aim above), the very  research component needs to have a corner of the logframe and funds allocation to be able to  collect the data proving the hypothesis (the objective here) right (or wrong). ",3171
negative,The Project had a series of design deficiencies which continued to cause difficulties into  implementation.,3172
negative,"The first design failing identified has been the matter of expected results, log  frame and how to operationalize these through adequate indicators.",3173
negative,"The design of the results  framework was not actually expressed as robust expected results, and this matter continued to  have an impact on the implementation modality throughout the life span of the Project, whereby  the focus was on obtaining products and not so much on obtaining effects or results.",3174
negative,"Although as in many other topics of the Project where effect is measured,  this cannot be solely attributable to this project given that there are many activities and  stakeholders dealing with exactly the same issues in the target zone, the Project reports  improvement of METT scores which can be in part attributable to SPANEST.

negative,These deficiencies were most  apparent with respect to the structure of the project management.,3182
negative,Special training should have been offered to the PC to help in  complying with these requirements. ,3183
negative,"The NES also has its own internal procedures; hence, the  project coordinator needed to learn and adapt to master the NES procedures, UNDP/GEF  project management procedures and to follow up on all technical, financial and administrative  aspect of the project.",3184

negative,"There was no systematic internal evaluation process of strengths and weaknesses of procedures and  tools developed, as the focus was more on achieving the targets as according to the log frame. ",3209
negative,The selection criteria of target districts and target villages could also have included criteria related to  poverty and food security to develop insights into how poorer communities deal with agro-biodiversity issues. ,3210
negative,Some agro-biodiversity activities implemented by ABP were not paid much attention by the local  partners due to the heavy engagement of TABI in two targeted districts and the initial focus on few  priority villages could not be done. ,3211

negative,"The intervention progress went very much  according to schedule and there are only a few cases in which progress diverged from the RBM’s,  e.g. in the case of the Public Employment Programme (PEP) in Vietnam which was stopped by  ILO because staff costs were weighing too heavily on the country office budget in Hanoi, and the  Single Window Service (SWS) in social protection was dropped in particular because it is not a  government priority at this time.",3230

negative,"Overall, gender mainstreaming has received clear attention in the ILO/Korea projects, but has not  always been actively addressed, and it is sometimes underdeveloped in tripartite organisations. ",3233
negative,"On the other hand, more explicit  attention is needed for gender issues, as was shown in several examples: five out of the six  occupations selected for Mutual Recognition of Skills (MRS) in three countries, Cambodia, Lao  PDR and Myanmar (CLM), are male-dominated and regional trainings mostly involve men; gender  mainstreaming is not very explicit in MRS, more specific gender indicators and gender provisions  are needed in social protection, while in Myanmar gender mainstreaming has often not been  acknowledged as an important issue by the stakeholders interviewed.",3234
negative,Policy formulation and capacity building  were much less explicit in Lao PDR and in Vietnam. ,3235
negative,"Compared to the  previous phase of the partnership, the Results-Based Management (RBM) of the three ILO-Korea  projects has clearly improved, but still requires substantial further improvements in the areas of  coordination between the three RBMs, of an officially verifiable Log Frame for each project, and  of the formulation of proper assumptions and Objectively Verifiable Indicators (OVI).

negative,The three  Log Frames should be more systematically developed along similar and comparable lines. ,3237
negative,"The workers’ and employers’ organizations (WO/EO) in the three CLM countries face many  challenges, such as limited resources, a low level of public-private partnership and a general lack  of information (Ruttiya Bhula-or 2018).",3238
negative,"Regarding WO specifically, their focus is on strengthening  labour unions by increasing union membership and by regularly campaigning for workers’  fundamental rights at work, and as a result, concerns about e.g. skills development are found to  be often secondary and limited. ",3239
negative,"In skills development, EO are usually more involved than WO, but the participation of employers  is considered to be crucial and needs to be further enhanced.",3240
negative,A challenge is that sometimes only  selected unions are being invited while sharing among unions has been limited.,3241
negative,"On the whole,  ensuring tripartite participation across all the intervention fields is an area for improvement, while  one WO (the Myanmar Industries, Craft and Services, MICS), as an emerging union, felt  sometimes somewhat neglected and left out from activities of the ILO Myanmar, although the  Liaison Office makes sure that it always treats all WO’s equally.",3242
negative,There is no sharing of information between the  ILO/Korea Partnership Programme and the KOICA Country Offices.,3243
negative,The allocation of resources requires important modifications in particular in the area of the  management arrangements since there were no provisions made for national professional and  for support staff.,3244
negative,It has been shown to be imperative to have a full-time national professional staff  in the ILO local office who can coordinate the activities in the three projects in the country in  question.,3245

negative,"While some of the program’s underlying assumptions have  materialized, particularly those around the program’s community-empowerment and  armed actor sensitization work, other important assumptions around duty-bearer  participation and response have not.",3260
negative,This has constrained the program’s ability to deliver  on outcome-level results.,3261
negative,The programme has struggled to develop and follow a coherent approach to  implementation across its consortium.,3262
negative,This is partly caused by institutional agreements  between Consortium partners; partly by the different thematic and geographical focus  areas of partners; and partly by incomplete use of central programme management tools. ,3263

negative,Lesson Learned: The composition and development of clear roles and responsibilities for the  PRD Consortium could have been more carefully considered during the original proposal process.,3271
negative,"While the EU’s Request for Proposal is culpable of inviting applicants to bid on an overly  ILO/Myanmar PRD Midterm Evaluation Exe Sum - 5 ambitious project with too short a proposal deadline, the Consortium members are ultimately  responsible for not fully considering how well their institutional capabilities aligned.",3272

negative,Social inclusion of vulnerable groups was not addressed.,3295
negative,"The project has not directly engaged with the unions, in social dialogue or promoting ILS (other projects have focussed on this). ",3296
negative,Indicators and targets should be formulated either in project design or very early on  during the project and should not be altered afterwards.,3297

negative,"The mapping survey was initiated 25 months after the project commenced and reduced  in scope in line with the available budget and time remaining, which in turn reduced the  overall scope and delayed the project as a whole. ",3319
negative,The main  shortcoming of the project was the sustainability of the results which were limited by the  scope of the project and dependent upon future funding for the development of related  proposals on diaspora engagement. ,3320
negative,"The project activities and outputs were consistent with the intended  results, as articulated in the Results Matrix (RM) but not all changes, such as the scope  of the mapping component were fully documented. ",3321
negative,"This significantly reduced the time available for activities, the  scope of the mapping and related outputs.",3322
negative,The majority of  project activities were delayed for a total of 25 months before commencement and were  carried out within budget while adjusting for a one year NCE needed to complete the  project. ,3323
negative,The challenges faced by the project were well documented but the significant  reduction in financial scope for some activities was not mentioned in the reporting.,3324
negative,"The budget had  a 16% underspend, a result of the reduced scope of project activities namely less  participants attending workshop-related activities in the US, and the reduced frequency  of travel by participants.",3325
negative,The longer-term impact of  the project is difficult to assess. ,3326
negative,The  mapping was not able to capture this major shift in attitude and this was regarded by a  number of interviewees as a significant lost opportunity. ,3327
negative,"However, it is less clear the extent to which the Portal is aligned to higher-level results (outcome and objective), related to weaknesses in the project logic. ",3328
negative,The project logic focuses on availability of a Portal (output) rather than how the Portal is used by target groups and how that in turn contributesto improved policy making and public debate.,3329
negative,This poses challenges to monitoring and evaluating those higher-level changes. ,3330
negative,"However, there are sometimes trade-offs between those areas and also a few aspects that could be improved, particularly related to usefulness and timeliness. ",3331
negative,"While the current Portal content aligns with the initial intentions, there are some related to proposed content in the project documents and reports that are not fully reflected.",3332
negative," Many of those were also identified in survey and interview responses, and therefore could be areas for potential expansion or improvements, such as: linking to national sources and contact persons; improving the country profiles; exploring other data sources that could be used, including data on current migration issues and events; and improving the map visualization.",3333
negative,"Thus, more data would be needed to explore this further.",3334
negative,"However, it was not possible with available data to determine the extent to which the specific target users are visiting the Portal – a  question posed in the initial Terms of Reference (ToR).",3335
negative,"However, various concerns were raised that relate to the functions and organization of the Portal, such as the user-friendliness of navigating it, explanations of the scope and content covered, and clarity on the timeline and content of the updates made to the Portal.",3336
negative,"Civil society organizations (CSOs), IOM, international organizations (IOs), private sector and media gave the lowest ratings. ",3337
negative,"However, there is limited evidence of whether and how it’s used to contribute to policymaking and public debate.",3338
negative,The evidence available for this evaluation is insufficient to draw conclusions on the alignment of observed use to the intended uses of the Portal.,3339
negative,"More data is needed from the users, particularly from the target groups (policymakers and media) given focus of the long- term objective on contributing to policymaking and public debate, together with a more explicit theory of change. ",3340
negative,"However, it is not clear how the absence of an updated  National Strategy (NS) and National Action Plan (NAP), at the time when the project was designed,  was overlooked.",3341
negative,This is an issue of design relevance that impacted negatively on the project’s  efficiency and effectiveness.,3342
negative,The project had to engage in an unforeseen lengthy and complicated  process until these critical national frameworks – which would provide the foundation for all project  interventions – were developed and formally endorsed.,3343
negative,"The project’s first Estimated Result also  seemed to assign the NCCTIP&PIM’s Technical Secretariat with an implementation role that the  Technical Secretariat is not institutionally positioned, or equipped, to perform.",3344
negative,"However, the project faced numerous delays.",3345
negative,The prolonged process of updating the NS and NAP  put the project activities on hold for two (2) years. ,3346

negative,Neither is it clear what would have the situation be had those there been no cancelled activities in the  project’s last year of operation. ,3351
negative,"Other  than the Training of Trainers, however, the project did not extend technical support to the  NCCTIP&PIM’s Secretariat to fulfil its role as may be understood from the statement of the project’s  first Estimated Result.",3352
negative,The  extent to which those trained by the project will continue to carry forward the knowledge they may  have acquired through these trainings is not clear; personnel transfer is an issue to reckon with.,3353
negative,"However, the lack of an institutional host or anchor for the awareness-raising campaign strategy,  methodology and branding casts some doubts with regards to the sustainability of the campaign.",3354
negative,The  NCCTIP&PIM’s Secretariat does not seem to have the resources or capacity to carry this forward.,3355
negative," It is not clear, however,  whether the Secretariat will continue to have adequate operational and maintenance budget to  maintain the premises and resources. ",3356
negative,The project did not directly work with VoTs. ,3357
negative,The extent  to which trained CSOs’ staff may have been able to benefit VoTs as a result of the training they  received is not clear. ,3358

negative,"While  key informants generally perceived that this double-hatting was well managed by the staff in  question, it blurred the lines between the SC and the CLA, and contributed to a perceived conflict  of interest during Cash Work Group (CWG) discussions.",3364
negative,"In May 2015, OCHA  activated an inter-sectoral Cash WG (CWG), which resulted in 3 months of disagreements and  negotiations amongst humanitarian agency, on the harmonisation of the MPCG transfer value,  and the HCT deciding to make cash a separate section in the Humanitarian Response Plan.",3365

negative,"While the SCT are  seen as responsive and helpful in responding to individual agency requests, it is believed that  time could be saved by making documents more easily accessible and traceable.",3369
negative,"The general perception shows a satisfactory prioritisation of activities, but some informants  expressed the need to refine this prioritisation, stressing the importance of needs in NGCA and  the lack of humanitarian assistance in this area.",3370
negative,The lack of baseline data especially in NGCA  remains a challenge to providing a clear picture of the context.,3371
negative,SCM minutes and the inter-cluster  Contingency Plan described the need to support authorities in carrying out more effective IDP  tracking in order to improve overall baseline data.,3372
negative,"Thus the most likely scenario for  deactivation of the SC is an improvement of the humanitarian situation, minimising the need to  coordinate response and gaps. ",3373
negative,These impacts are promising but  primarily limited to the short-term; the Programme still lacks fundamental activities necessary for  sustainable medium to long-term impact.,3374

negative,The Mid-Term Evaluation suggests that the Graduation Programme can and should be used a tool to  respond in a holistic manner to the specific protection risks faced by refugees in Egypt.,3376
negative,"To date, the Programme has functioned quite separately from protection, despite the fact that protection and livelihoods  are fully interdependent.",3377
negative,"However, the  majority of programme participants are still caught in a quite vulnerable position as 94% (CRS) and 79%  (Caritas) of surveyed participants reported that they can barely cover their basic needs usually receiving  humanitarian support from families and neighbors.",3378
negative,"While this is a considerably high rate, rates of refugees who has been retained in their  jobs beyond 6 months, decrease substantially ± to 17% (CRS) and 35% (Caritas).",3379
negative,"This may be addressed  through a number of methods, including better ensuring that training programs are based on accurate  assessment of needs and market demand; improved matching between refugee skills and job  requirements; and more outreach and engagement with private employers.",3380
negative,"Considering the current barriers  to legal employment and lack of proper protection and the relative success realized in the self-employment  track (SET) and home-based businesses, the livelihoods programme should consider a review of the  viability and / or placing deeper activities including protection in order to improve WET outcomes.",3381

negative,This report details several factors that could be improved in order to develop sustainable  and growing businesses.,3385

negative,"Case  management and mentorship activities are evident in the early stage of the program where it supported  program participants to kick-start their businesses, including training and business planning, but  individualized attention decreases prematurely, with little tailored business support to micro-entrepreneurs  starting up and improving their businesses.",3387
negative,This might be attributed to lack of capacity of caseworkers  and/or the lack of a coherent strategy for the application of the mentorship system.,3388
negative,"A sustainable, locally  based business incubator could stimulate and improve continued mentorship.",3389

negative,"However, for many, these costs still represent a significant  barrier to getting children into school, leaving some children of school age out of the  system.",3406
negative,The evaluation indicated that an increased spending on educational costs was  directly associated with an increase in the employment of food-related negative coping  strategies.,3407

negative,Communication is essential for  organisational effectiveness or the efficiency with which an association is able to meet its  objectives. ,3470
negative," However, the lack of non-government organizations (NGOs) prior to the crisis and the need to build capacity of implementing partners in  combination with donor conditionalities posed numerous constraints.",3471

negative,"The WASH programme was not without missteps or shortcoming, which the evaluation team  discusses in the full report. ",3478
negative,"However, it is difficult to judge the relevance  of these interventions as many other international organizations provide services in these  communities and the degree to which the UNICEF programme addresses needs generated by  the refugee crisis is unclear. ",3479
negative,"The WASH  Programme struggled to meet its targets in its activities focused on supporting host  communities, including WASH in schools.",3480
negative,"While people entering the camps may have been the most vulnerable at the programme’s  outset, the evaluation team believes that in later years occupants of ITSs were more  vulnerable and received less attention from the WASH programme.",3481
negative,"Based on the documentation that was shared with the evaluation team as well as its  interviews with UNICEF staff, partners, and other stakeholder, the programme appears to  lack analytical rigor for determining the programme’s objectives, indicators or resource  allocation, which has led it to overcommit to initiatives for which it did not have resources or  capacity, primarily in host communities.",3482
negative,"The WASH programme should implement a  monitoring and evaluation system, and comply with the strategic programme development  protocols and reviews that are detailed in the Jordan Country Programme 2013-2017.",3483

negative,"In contrast, UNICEF had limited involvement in  the protocol development in NBSUs, and protocols were lacking in these units. ",3487
negative,"Despite these efforts,  the evaluation noted a shortage of specialists such as neonatologists and paediatricians in the SNCUs. ",3488
negative,Respondents at state and district levels reported staff tend to refuse postings to rural settings.,3489
negative,"Moreover, placement policies were poor with staff trained in newborn care being shifted into areas  of care where their skills are not utilised. ",3490
negative,"A substantial proportion of nurses were contractual rather  than permanent – hired on time-bound contracts - which was seen to be unsustainable; there was  frequent staff turnover, leading to loss of institutional memory of key interventions.",3491

negative,"Overall, the view was despite capacity building initiatives supported by UNICEF, the use of data for quality improvement in the facilities was poor.",3493
negative,"However, some state level policies have had  the unintended impact of limiting access to certain groups. ",3494
negative,"For example, policies introduced in Uttar  Pradesh to reduce overcrowding in SNCUs has disproportionately disadvantaged babies referred from  distant or tribal populations, which could result in increasing equity gaps in newborn survival. ",3495
negative,Under-representation of baby girls in SNCU admissions compared to the sex ratio in children in the general population suggests baby girls remain at a disadvantage.,3496
negative,"Respondents to KIIs confirmed these  findings suggesting that although gender bias had reduced due to educational activities by accredited  4 social health activist (ASHAs), gender bias still existed among some communities.",3497
negative,"UNICEF’s support to the programme was said to be too focussed on promoting the use of SNCUs, and  less on other aspects of FBNC, such as the NBSUs.",3498
negative,"Many stakeholders, including policymakers, development partners and collaborative centre respondents, felt that if NBSUs had received more  support, overcrowding could have been reduced in SNCU units.",3499
negative,As a result newborn care was  perceived to be available only at district headquarters level and not elsewhere in the district.,3500
negative,Yet these units had only 326 beds available and staff numbers  were lower than recommended.,3501
negative,"Moreover, in spite of the mechanisms put in place with UNICEF support, follow-up of discharged  newborns in the community in some states was very poor. ",3502
negative,"In the states where data were available, only 39.4 per cent of discharged newborns received follow up visits in the communities.",3503
negative,"While protocols existed for ASHAs to follow up newborns  discharged from SNCUs, their training and capacity to provide such follow-up care was poor and the  quality of such follow-up care was not monitored in the programme. ",3504
negative,"Overall, links between maternal health and newborn health were poor, programmatically and  operationally, according to almost all respondents including policymakers at national and state levels,  development partners, collaborative centre respondents and professional association members.",3505
negative,"SNCUs were seen to be ‘islands of excellence’ in the facilities with no links to other important  components of care in the same facilities, notably labour wards and NBSUs.",3506
negative,"However, these initiatives have had minimal impact.",3507
negative,"The evaluation team observed during  facility assessments that quality of care in labour rooms was suboptimal as evidenced, for example, by lack of adherence to protocols related to partographs and significantly low caesarean section rates in many states, especially at night1 . ",3508
negative,These key challenges were seen by stakeholders as affecting the quality of care provided in SNCUs.,3509
negative,Data showed consistent trends of minimal improvement in case fatality rates in SNCUS.,3510
negative,"The evaluation can only provide limited conclusions on efficiency, mainly due to unavailability of cost  data linked to outcomes.",3511
negative,"While the low expenditure could be due to errors in planning for operationalising these  units, it was difficult to draw conclusions; SNCUs PIP budgetary allocations were available in the public  domain data but not fund utilisation.",3512
negative,"In addition, although UNICEF’s support was described as a very efficient use of resources by both  programme and facility level staff, figures on the actual costs of the UNICEF investment in the  programme were unavailable.",3513
negative,This made it impossible to draw strong conclusions on the efficiency of  UNICEF spending on the FBNC programme.,3514
negative,"The findings under Effectiveness can point to the efficiency  of UNICEF support to some extent: the effort and resources invested in supporting the FBNC  programme, and specifically the SNCUs, have resulted in the scale-up of SNCUs, but have not always  translated into the intended results on the ground, especially regarding quality of care.",3515
negative,"However, this implementation, as noted earlier, has been varied across states. ",3516
negative,"Challenges to sustainability include the previously mentioned lack of human resources, poor  equipment maintenance, weak community linkages for effective referrals, and poor decentralisation  of the mentorship programme.",3517
negative,"Also, the quality of and the capacity to use the data was poor.",3518
negative,"Most  respondents at state and national levelsfelt that addressing these challenges would require continued  mentoring and support from UNICEF, without which, the successes achieved in the programme could  become unsustainable. ",3519
negative,"However, there are still areas for improvement. ",3520
negative,"These include ensuring the SNCU develops strong  links with other components of the FBNC, notably community care and maternal health. ",3521
negative,"In addition,  UNICEF should ensure better implementation of existing policies and guidelines related to quality of  perinatal care in facilities, more effective and efficient human resourcing and capacity-building and  ensuring more effective follow-up of SNCU-discharged babies.",3522
negative,The potential of the SNCU online data  system could be better used. ,3523
negative,"Nevertheless, challenges persist within the areas that UNICEF provided support, as well as  beyond, notably improving newborn care through FBNC and SNCUs.",3524
negative,"However, it is important to note that the levels of food  insecurity among the beneficiary group remain quite high, with many indicators of food  insecurity averaging more than 70% for beneficiaries.",3525
negative,"Thus, much more room exists for the  programme to improve these indicators and further reduce food insecurity.",3526
negative,"Half of the treatment group now has access to a latrine; however, there is still  much room to improve given the importance of accessing a latrine and that half of the  beneficiaries still do not have one.",3527
negative,"However, the programme decreased  the likelihood that children are currently being breastfed.",3528
negative,"It is unclear why these two, seemingly  contradictory, results occur. ",3529
negative,"When we focus on children  under 2 years old, we see that results hold for reducing acutely malnourished children (measured  by MUAC) but fail to detect effects on other anthropometric measures among infants. ",3530
negative,The data collected on nutrition possibly were not of  the highest standard and might have led to these contrary results.,3531
negative,"Evidence to date suggests that  cash alone has not been successful at improving young child nutrition on average due to the  complexity of factors that underlie malnutrition (de Groot, Palermo, Handa, Ragno, & Peterman, 2017). ",3532
negative,"Child Protection: We do not find any impacts of the programme on parental engagement with  their children with respect to monitoring their education, health, and playing with them, which  would have been encouraged during the supplemental trainings.",3533
negative,"However, these indicators are  already at quite high levels in both the treatment and comparison groups, indicating a lack of room for the programme to generate additional impacts.",3534
negative," In other words, a ceiling effect might be  occurring for these indicators. ",3535
negative,"This indicator tops out at 5 days a week, so there is less room for  the programme to show improvements.",3536
negative,"We find a negative effect on whether the child  received food in school, with a 13 percentage point decrease.",3537
negative,Perhaps this indicates that schools  are less likely to provide food for children if they know the child receives the transfer.,3538
negative,This is  something for the programme implementers to investigate further.,3539
negative,"Effectiveness: Overall, people know about the programme and where to access information;  however, there is some misunderstanding about eligibility, payment frequency, and where the  funds originate.",3540
negative,"Despite advertising the transfer schedule 7 days in advance, more than half of  the beneficiaries (55%) report not knowing when they will receive their next transfer. ",3541
negative,"Reducing the travel time of those who must travel more than an  hour, especially those who travel upwards of 2 hours, might represent a way to improve the  programme and in turn the impacts it can generate.",3542
negative,"The programme demonstrates strong effects for improving food  security and in turn reducing the use of negative coping strategies, although there is still room to  improve across these domains with more than half of the beneficiaries still suffering from severe  food insecurity.",3543
negative,Yet another side to this story is about the limitation of the programme to move households into a  less vulnerable situation.,3544
negative,"Although the programme leads to increased food consumption,  beneficiary households remain at very high levels of food insecurity, with 89% reporting that  they skip meals due to lack of money and 74% reporting that there is no food in the household  due to lack of money, while 60% spent the night without eating and 55% spent the entire day  without eating.",3545
negative,We do find the transfer reduces some child nutritional outcomes (wasting and  MUAC malnourishment) but not others (stunting and underweight).,3546
negative,"Most cash transfer  programmes in sub-Saharan Africa do not demonstrate positive impacts on child nutrition, and  the latest theory argues that cash transfers need to be supplemented by other nutrition-related  programmes, such as education about child feeding, access to clean water, and improved  sanitation, to have an effect on child nutrition. ",3547
negative,"The programme generates inconsistent impacts to  the intrahousehold dynamics with mixed positive and negative impacts, both at low levels (3  percentage points). ",3548
negative,The research team has some concern about the ability of the study to identify impacts  accurately and attribute them to the programme.,3549
negative,"The  research team does not have baseline measures for the comparison group, thus we can only  match treatment and comparison households on observed characteristics at endline that are not  affected by the programme, such as age, gender, caregivers’ education level, and family size.1",3550
negative,Systematic differences might have been between the two groups before  the programme started that we cannot account for because they are outcomes of interest.,3551
negative,"However, the  data from Balochistan, FATA and GB show that the MCW initiative’s overall efficiency was undermined as  resources did not reach to the marginalized or poorest groups.",3552
negative,The qualitative data also reveals that health  workers lacked motivation in the absence of monetary compensation for additional work.,3553
negative,This had a negative  impact on their efficiency and job productivity. ,3554
negative,"Most key  informants from almost all provinces suggested that the provincial health departments may earmark a greater  share of their finances for this initiative, so the MCWs’ outreach can be extended to the most marginalized  segments of the society. ",3555
negative,"The qualitative data shows that some management and capacity issues such as scarcity of financial and human  resources, the exclusion of areas that are not covered by LHWS and flaws in micro-planning hindered the  sustainability of the MCW initiative. ",3556
negative,"Irregular logistical supplies, limited coordination at the service provider level, weak monitoring mechanism, lack  of financial incentives, lack of resources, and poor law and order situations hindered the smooth  implementation of MCW initiative in Balochistan, FATA and GB.",3557
negative,"The qualitative data shows that the MCW did not address these cross-cutting issues such as gender, disaster risk  and security while providing services to the mothers and children. ",3558
negative,"However, variations are apparent across regions.",3559
negative,"The initiative can be further improved through effective participation  13 of civil society and communities, adequate and timely provision of logistical supplies, and by enhancing financial  incentives for field teams.",3560
negative,"In terms of meeting policy standards, at the school level the project met policy standards for  adequate toilets for boys (46.2% of the schools) but did not achieve the same for girls (69.2% of the schools) at the time of latrine construction in 2016.",3561
negative,Children in infant  grades were worse off as the shortage of toilets was toilets was three to eight times greater  than that for girls and boys in senior grades.,3562
negative,These results show equity was not fully captured in implementation.,3563
negative,"However, the provision  of a blanket number of squat holes per school further negated equity objectives as some  schools ended up with over supply of toilets (38.5% of schools) while others faced a huge  shortage (46.2% of schools) at the time of construction in 2016. ",3564
negative,There were policy gaps that needed to be addressed to enhance WASH in schools including:  1) the package of support for MHM in schools including nationally approved national designs  for girl friendly toilets; 2) hygiene education and related child friendly materials; and 3) ensuring  satellite schools are established in places with easy access to water.,3565
negative,"The Education Management Information (EMIS) was observed to collect relevant information  to inform WASH in Schools, however there were gaps in measurement of MHM support in  schools.",3566
negative,Thus no  specific needs assessment was undertaken to determine causality.,3567
negative,NGO partners did  undertake needs assessments but these were adhoc and not collecting all the information  required to inform a WASH in schools intervention. ,3568
negative,The result was that while the project design  was largely appropriate to address the needs of targeted schools improvements could have  been made to address the specific needs of: 1) girls; 2) children in infant grades or Early  Childhood Development (ECD)); and 3) Children with Disabilities (CwD).,3569
negative,"For example, the  project did not fully address issues of menstrual hygiene management (MHM) for girls at  menarche and those of children with disabilities.",3570
negative,"For ECD, toilet and hand washing access  were a challenge as handwashing tanks were far from their toilets and the toilets were too few  for the enrolment numbers of ECD.",3571
negative,The project missed an opportunity to influence policy  direction on MHM and disability friendly WASH as these issues were not fully captured in  implementation despite a consciousness of the project’s need to address them among  implementers. ,3572
negative,This situation seemed to be influenced by two reasons: 1) the project design  not fully capturing these issues and therefore not providing a standard which left partners to  implement according to their own experience leading to variances in implementation between  districts; and 2) the lack of adequate policy guidance on standards. ,3573

negative,"This translated into the lack of  quality assurance mechanisms shared by  implementing partners, indicating need in the  relevant training provision. ",3743
negative,"Various factors had an adverse impact on the achievement of PGRP-SEE results: a)  significant time and efforts were needed to build the right regulatory frameworks and  systems to enable GRB; therefore, practical implementation of GRB has only been  possible during the second half of the project; b) the complex structure of government  institutions in BiH, which required PGRP-SEE staff to engage and implement separate  activities at the state-level and in each entity; c) the lack of high level GRB champions in  the FYR Macedonia Ministry of Finance and General Secretariat; d) The absence of a  PBB approach in FYR Macedonia and the difficulty to identify entry points in the line- based budgeting system for gender to be included and funds allocated; and e) the  challenging political environment in each of the countries including post-election changes  in leadership. ",3744
negative,"With support from the Sub- 6 Regional Office, project staff made an extraordinary effort to keep the project running  despite the challenges they faced; however, greater results could have been achieved  had the Project Manager and FYR Macedonia Coordinator been in place at the  beginning of the project.",3745
negative,"In all three countries, institutional capacity to implement GRB is still being developed and, since changes to regulatory and institutional frameworks to enable GRB are recent, more time is needed to support civil servants, CSOs and MPs to fully apply and implement it.",3746
negative,"While a number of civil servants at the ministry and municipal level have increased confidence, knowledge and willingness to apply GRB into their programmes, many capacity development beneficiaries indicated they still need support and assistance to integrate it into their daily work, in particular through on-the-job coaching and mentoring.",3747
negative,"While some of the project beneficiaries will require no or minimal assistance to sustain their GRB work, continuous technical and financial support from UN Women is still needed to fully integrate GRB in planning and budgeting systems and to further build the capacity of the ministries of finance to fully lead and support GRB implementation.",3748
negative,"The Evaluation identified several factors that are likely to pose challenges to sustainability including a) the fact that GRB is still being led by the GEMs in BiH and FYR Macedonia instead of the ministries of finance; b) the limited political will and commitment of the FYR Macedonia Ministry of Finance and General Secretariat to fully integrate GRB into strategic planning processes, the budget law and budget templates; c) the absence of GRB in the Budget Management Information System in BiH; and d) GRB capacity retention in Albania, particularly of supportive senior-level officials in light of potential staff turnover with the incoming government.",3749
negative,"While many of the lessons learned from the first phase of project implementation were applied in the design and implementation of the current project, a remaining area of weakness has been the results and performance measurement frameworks which have hampered the ability of project staff to fully capture all of their achievements and systematically measure and track progress made towards project results.",3750
negative,"Though the programme design was appropriate its greater emphasis was at the institutional and  policy level, and lesser explicit emphasis was on beneficiaries, particularly women from rural areas,  as key economic actors and rights holders.",3751
negative,"The  outputs to achieve Outcome 1 were not fully matched to achieve Outcome 1, especially the  ""increase in rate of employed and economically active women"". ",3752
negative,"While very good progress was made  towards achieving Outcome 1 in terms of the successful establishment of the JISB, design issues in  this Outcome did not address for the most part key dimensions of women's economic empowerment  and employability per se. ",3753
negative,"However, data on numbers of women  and men employed/self employed as a result of JISBs activities was limited and unavailable.",3754
negative,But capacities of rights holders (rural women) to become  engaged in entrepreneurial activities and to claim and practice their economic and social rights has  yet to be fully addressed.,3755
negative,"However, more concerted and focused  efforts are required to develop capacities of women's rights holders to become economically  9 empowered with skills and abilities in entrepreneurial activities, and enhanced knowledge about their  economic and social rights in order to practice these rights.",3756
negative,Capacity development interventions for  duty bearers and rights holders call for a better balance as the project moves forward,3757
negative,"But in terms of specific employment and entrepreneurship aspects, a majority expressed  an eagerness to receive more concrete/tangible support, such as vocational courses, business  trainings, financial support for their businesses and child care services. ",3758
negative,"However this varies, being partially achieved by the GCGE, DEO, NEA, LI and  more fully achieved by the NBS.",3759
negative,"In term of beneficiaries, women and men, their participation and involvement in the  functioning and decision making processes of the JISBs and the project is limited and there is still  some way to go for them to demonstrate ownership in the WEE programme.",3760
negative,"Therefore, it cannot be  conclusively stated that all requirements of national ownership have been met over this short  programme period. ",3761
negative,"Outcome1. was achieved through the JISBs, but requires a clear and specific focus on increased  rate of employed and economically active women and enhancing women's entrepreneurial and  income earning potential.",3762
negative,A monitoring system and digitalization of JISBs in progress will enhance  efficiency; and capacity building for rights holders stands out as a significant priority to be addressed  during the remaining project period.,3763
negative,"There is, however, room for improvement in the  gender responsiveness of research projects and research priority setting.",3764
negative,"Improvements were noted since  the portfolio review and priority-setting process initiated in 2016 which, however, only affected the work  at the end of the evaluation period.",3765
negative,HRP’s systems and practice of reporting on research products to the  PCC and of maintaining records to document research need considerable improvements.,3766
negative,Concerns were raised that HRP was spreading itself too thin with suggestions that this risk could be  mitigated by refocusing the effort on working more extensively in partnership with research centres in  programme countries and less on conducting research projects by in-house scientists.,3767
negative,Intentions to focus more strongly on implementation research have been expressed since the start of the  evaluation period and are strongly supported by a majority of interviewed stakeholders.,3768
negative,"Progress has so far been slow, and the envisaged regional  capacity-building networks are not yet fulfilling their role.",3769
negative,"Although the concept and goal of the HRP  Alliance are clear, there is little information about the strategy of how to reach this goal. ",3770
negative," the  evaluation period, the promotion of gender equality, equity and human rights received insufficient  attention in the efforts to develop the HRP Alliance.",3771
negative,Key informants agreed that the human resources mobilised by HRP to develop and support the HRP  Alliance as a capacity-building network for SRHR research are greatly insufficient.,3772
negative,External informants  commented mostly on the invisibility of the HRP Alliance. ,3773
negative,"This does, however, not replace the goal to build the regional  networks of strong SRHR research, training and mentoring centres for SRHR research as envisaged under  the HRP Alliance.",3774
negative,Such a network is also essential for supporting HRP’s intended shift of focus towards  implementation research.,3775
negative,"HRP’s work in knowledge translation and the engagement of decision-makers in dialogues on the  implementation of evidence-based solutions and policies has been effective but not very visible, especially  at country level.",3776
negative,The indicator and data used by HRP to monitor and report results under this output do not adequately  reflect the performance and achievements of the Programme in the translation of evidence into policy.,3777
negative,The issue of uptake and  implementation of the guidance was raised by interviewed PCC members. ,3778
negative,The Standing Committee is barely exercising its governance role as defined in the memorandum signed  by the cosponsoring agencies. ,3779
negative,The weak  participation of PCC delegates from countries elected by the WHO regional committees in the PCC  deliberations has been commented on in previous evaluations and has not improved substantially.,3780
negative,"In the  view of some delegates from donor countries, the processes of the PCC meetings constrain the ability of  the PCC to act as an effective organ of governance and to engage delegates in meaningful strategic  discussions. ",3781
negative,"Although it  has largely achieved or surpassed its performance targets throughout the evaluation period, the  indicators and targets are established at a very low level of the results chain.",3782
negative,"In addition, the reported output results are  overloaded with double counting and the inclusion of data that are only marginally meaningful.",3783
negative,"Staff of both departments, however, acknowledge that the division of their work in two separate  departments creates unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic hurdles.",3784
negative,"However, there was a trend towards an increase in the proportion of designated funding during  the period which, if it continues, would be an issue of concern.",3785
negative,The number and profile of donors to the Trust Fund have been steady but funding from cosponsors almost  fully collapsed except for regular contributions by WHO.,3786
negative,Applicant countries have major needs for research evidence in SRHR for the development of their  investment cases and for the implementation of their programmes.,3787
negative,Consultations between HRP and the GFF Secretariat aiming at establishing more structured and  substantive cooperation have so far not been productive. ,3788
negative,The  Programme has endorsed this shift but did not make much progress in during the 2013 to 2017 evaluation  period. ,3789
negative,"While it has a  unique position in these tasks in some niche areas, its role in most areas of sexual and reproductive health  and rights overlaps with the roles and mandates of normative UN agencies, primarily WHO.",3790
negative,"It was, however, not implemented  with sufficient energy and human resources during the evaluation period",3791
negative,"Progress in the  work on research capacity strengthening through the HRP Alliance has been slow, and the envisaged  regional capacity-building networks are not yet fulfilling their role.",3792
negative,There is insufficient information about  the strategy of how to reach this goal.,3793
negative,"These outcomes were, however, not monitored nor systematically reported. ",3794
negative,"However, its results monitoring framework developed on the basis of a Theory of Change is  weak.",3795
negative,"It only monitors results at the output level, including outputs that are sometimes only marginally  meaningful.",3796
negative,This has constrained the ability of the Programme to document its effectiveness.,3797
negative,"Governance of HRP through the PCC is appreciated by stakeholders for its openness and inclusiveness,  but for the same reasons there are concerns that it is not a fully effective organ of governance.",3798
negative,The  Standing Committee of cosponsoring partners is barely exercising its governance functions but is  experiencing a revival as a coordination platform.,3799
negative,The co-management of HRP with the WHO PDRH within the WHO Department of RHR is complex with  overlapping roles that vary by programme area.,3800
negative,"A similar situation exists in terms of inter-departmental  work, especially in maternal and perinatal health with the WHO Department of MCA.",3801
negative,"Many stakeholders, including WHO staff, however expressed a need to come to arrive at a more  stable situation of formal role divisions without creating programme silos.",3802
negative,These changes  were however not systematically monitored and reported.,3803
negative,Progress in generating sustainable outcomes through building research capacity was slow and outcomes  were weak. ,3804
negative,The process of creating a regional capacity-building network through the HRP Alliance was  started without an explicit strategy and with insufficient allocation of human resources.,3805
negative,"Although the Programme was a leader in the WHO structure in mainstreaming of gender, equity  and human rights, consistent mainstreaming in HRP’s research portfolio was not achieved. ",3806
negative,An  analysis of the expenditure database of research products for the past three biennia found that  expenditures on implementation studies had decreased rather than increased over this time-period.,3807
negative,"The current GLP delivered by Berlitz provides good equity of access to staff in all offices, although  there are still challenges to overcome related to technical issues, capacity and time for learning  during a working day, digital literacy, the time BVC classes are held, and general awareness of  the GLP programme. ",3808
negative,"Technical issues emerge as an overarching challenge for access, however the timing of BVC  sessions and dedicated time in the day for learning appear to be more of a factor for those unable  to complete a course.",3809
negative,"These technical issues fall into three categories: technical problems with  internet or communication systems / equipment, challenges with the Berlitz platform and levels  of digital literacy.",3810
negative,"Digital literacy was particularly identified in the interviews with SA & SDL  representatives, Berlitz and other UN agencies; i.e. the necessary level of digital literacy needed  to effectively engage with online learning, and the varying levels amongst the staff.",3811
negative,"Of  3 those survey respondents who had not taken a course, 49% reported needing more information  about the courses available in order to understand what is on offer and how to enroll on a course.",3812
negative,"However, there is a question around equity in regards to those who are  using their personal time to attend classes rather than allocated time within their working day. ",3813
negative,"The average attendance levels for the Berlitz programme are slightly lower than those recorded  for the previous face to face programme, however this may be affected by the nature of  recording attendance for online programmes. ",3814
negative,"This includes challenges of managing workload, scheduling and  ringfencing time in office hours, support to spend dedicated time on learning and a suitable  environment for learning. ",3815
negative,There is quite a marked difference between  different levels of satisfaction between WHO HQ and other offices which suggest the need for  more advocacy to improve understanding of the purpose and expectations of the online learning  programmes. ,3816
negative,"Going forward, areas for further consideration internally include (i) reviewing and strengthening  the organizational strategy for career development and learning, highlighting the importance  and value of language learning for WHO, and providing more support for staff to take courses in  their working day (ii) advocacy around the courses particularly in HQ to promote the value of the  GLP to staff (iii) a regional approach to improving engagement focusing on the particular issues  identified above in relation to different regions and offices (iv) strengthening the communication  strategy and capacity for disseminating information about the GLP courses available to staff.",3817
negative,"In addition other areas for consideration include (i) working closer with Berlitz to tailor the GLP to the needs of WHO staff (e.g. scheduling of BVC classes, more focus on technical language,  extra support for those who feel they are in the wrong learning level, preparation for the UN  exam) (ii) a more coordinated approach between WHO and Berlitz to address technical  challenges across the board and on a regional basis (iii) developing strategies to improve general  digital literacy for learning across the regions (v) more detailed reporting on learners  perspectives on quality, accessibility and enjoyment of the programmes.",3818
negative,At the same time an opportunity  was seen for fine-tuning its scope in light of the  evolving immunization space and for better balancing  scientific advice with programmatic issues and  implementability.,3819
negative,More systematic consideration of regional and  country needs was indicated as an area of attention  with the goal of ensuring adequate focus on all  WHO member states and of providing regionally  differentiated guidance.,3820
negative,"The need for strengthening  communication links between SAGE, RITAGs and  NITAGs was emphasised so that region-specific  questions could be taken up at SAGE and appropriate  feedback provided on how SAGE recommendations are  considered, adjusted and implemented. ",3821
negative,Room for clarification was also seen with respect to  the positioning of other WHO immunization  advisory committees1 in the SAGE decision-making  process and to the potential overlap of their roles and  responsibilities.,3822
negative,"However, several areas for  improvement were highlighted, including the agenda- setting process, the role of the chair and vice-chair, the  use of modern communication technology and the fact  that too many sessions were held ‘for information’ only.",3823
negative,Some concerns were raised about the role of key  technical partners and the potential risk of their  disproportionate influence. ,3824
negative,The need was expressed for  a more precise definition of what constitutes a conflict  of interest (CoI)in this setting.,3825
negative,"The efficacy and breadth of  dissemination of SAGE output beyond scientific  publications was seen as an area for improvement  and suggestions were made for a constituency- tailored approach, adapting means and channels of  communications to specific stakeholder groups. ",3826
negative,"Even so, organising inter‐sectoral dialogue sometimes proves to be a challenge.",3827
negative,"The translation of central health policies into implementation, both at central and decentralised level, remains a key challenge as well for many countries.",3828
negative,olicy dialogue on health financing often proved to be challenging as it deals with politically sensitive issues in UHC like (re‐)distribution and (re‐)allocation of resources.,3829
negative,"Moreover, on occasion the MoH even requested support which does not align with evidence on what works to progress towards UHC.",3830
negative,One of the major challenges the UHC‐P faced during the implementation of the programme was the small pool of technical advisors qualified and available to take up the additional health system strengthening (HSS) advisory rolesin the country offices.,3831
negative,"Nevertheless, there are some key questions that should be considered by the three partners with regards to both the sustainability of the support and how to maximize results in new countries.",3832
negative,"Roadmaps were sometimes ambitious for the crises encountered in the countries, limited timeframe of the programme and the complexity that policy dialogue entails.",3833
negative,"Support to HSS and HF require senior candidates with a rather specific set of skills(thematic, language and more), potential candidates are not always easy to identify and recruit.",3834
negative,We would recommend to increase full‐mode TA for UHC‐P on both types of TA – health system strengthening and health financing for continued expertise on policy advice.,3835
