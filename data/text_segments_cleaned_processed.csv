,segment,sentiment
0,the delivery of output under component 1 have be slow with most effort focus on support for various capacity building and technical workshop,negative
1,delivery of a global set of good practice in tuna fishery mcs the international mcs network imcsn tuna subnetwork and the mcs certification course need great attention from the project management unit and partner if -PRON- be to be complete before the end of the project,negative
2,however although key project position be fill early many project initiative be delay due to fao administrative process and requirement,negative
3,however there be a lack of capacity in some area notably communication and the project manager have to split -PRON- time between two demand job for most of the last year this negatively impact decision- making and delivery of some project output,negative
4,although reporting of the project budget be an agenda item at every psc meeting stakeholder express the need for increase transparency in the financial reporting from member of the psc,negative
5,this be partly due to a lack of clarity over role and responsibility at the onset of the project for some partner and stakeholder group with different expectation and understanding of -PRON- level of engagement in the project,negative
6,this be particularly the case for partner lead activity that do not have clear project agree end point and deliverable,negative
7,quality and delivery could be improve at the operational level,negative
8,the project logframe could be streamline to improve m&e and there be a need for more target communication outreach and advocacy effort,negative
9,however there be limited funding at the design stage which reduce opportunity for stakeholder consultation and involvement,negative
10,m&e be challenge due to the large number of poorly formulate indicator and associated target,negative
11,however ownership of the project be mixed particularly during the design stage,negative
12,the project have develop a large and diverse mix of partner,negative
13,the project do not undertake a gender analysis at the inception phase of the project or develop a gender strategy or gender action plan in accordance with the late fao guidance on gender equality,negative
14,while there be good potential for the sustainability of some project result e.g. fao be source funding to promote the port state measure template and catch documentation scheme implementation ongoing financial and institutional support be unclear for many activitie,negative
15,this limit the potential for cross- programme learning and coordination of approach,negative
16,furthermore the training of facilitator and long term engagement be inadequate the ongoing provision of free input to demonstration farmer be questionable the programme give limited emphasis to environmentally sustainable agricultural technique and target support for the poor and landless be lack,negative
17,however there be continue provision of free input under project 011 beyond the time period within which this be justify,negative
18,partnership with government be strong at local level than at national level and this may have compromise the capacity of the project to influence the wide policy and enable environment,negative
19,furthermore there be rather limited attention to empowerment of the poor and landless under this project,negative
20,there be an intentional shift of focus agree between the department of fishery and project management to fishery co management in an area where opportunity for mangrove co management be very limited but this shift be not reflect in a revised logframe and render the original logframe largely irrelevant as a project management and monitoring and evaluation tool,negative
21,the component project 010 011 and 012 be independently design with separate logical framework and reporting procedure,negative
22,project 010 be implement in a geographic area wherein the original rationale and logic could not apply and the focus be shift from mangrove co management to fishery co- management,negative
23,the theory of change of 012 be weak and this be reflect in some ad hoc intervention and a lack of strategy in implementation,negative
24,all three logframe be weak in term of define the ambition and approach of the programme to build strong sustainable community base organization and in term of target the poor member of society,negative
25,there be some limitation in term of target the most vulnerable member of society and in particular the landless under project 011,negative
26,however there be significant internal and external threat to -PRON- long term survival and more could have be do to address -PRON-,negative
27,the programme could nonetheless have integrate other drr measure more effectively into -PRON- activity such as integrate shelter with collection centre construction,negative
28,however the extent to which this occur be constrain by the specificity of earmark by some resource partner,negative
29,the quality of monitoring and reporting be mix at the project level and weak at the programme level,negative
30,the limited understanding and generally low profile of the fmm among stakeholder be reduce interest among potential new resource partner,negative
31,decision make process be ill define and poorly understand,negative
32,sub regional and regional office involvement have be negligible,negative
33,however -PRON- be see as especially problematic within fmm,negative
34,although these seem fairly well establish at the high decision- make level the underlie logic for the selection of fmm proposal within sos be still unclear,negative
35,fmm be not yet operate effectively as a pool programmatic funding mechanism,negative
36,the absence of an fmm logframe and clear operational procedure below the strategic programme leader spl level be confusing for stakeholder and undermine the cost- effectiveness of the selection process of fmm fund initiative,negative
37,mm documentation and reporting procedure be intentionally minimal but still weak at programme level,negative
38,fmm procedure have not be formally document in the same way as other funding instrument,negative
39,much of the work be of a normative nature with country level activity use to validate hq base normative study,negative
40,there be also concern at the operational level express by most strategic programme leader spls and budget holder about the stability and predictability of fmm funding,negative
41,fmm have not be able to deliver a satisfactorily stable or predictable level of funding over a full mtp or even a biennium,negative
42,the predictability issue create a number of operational difficulty relate to small and fragmented project stop go project implementation hurried decision making in funding allocation with limited consultation beyond fao headquarters and short project duration which impede efficiency and sustainability,negative
43,sustainability may be enhance if target ffpo contribute counterpart funding to the budget of -PRON- project,negative
44,while those training be essential -PRON- be not sufficient to develop value chain which require additional support to ffpos to improve -PRON- term of engagement with national regional and international market,negative
45,the evaluation find that the focus of capacity development activity should be refine from strengthen and support the ministry of environment and forest to a focus on strengthen and support the development implementation and monitoring of the cip,negative
46,the cip contain input from 40 ministry and 45 government agency of which key staff require technical and functional capacity development in regard to the cip,negative
47,therefore while valuable training effort have be undertake a more targeted approach to capacity development focus on the capacity both technical and functional need to implement and monitor the cip would have be a more realistic approach,negative
48,these mixed logical framework result should be view as shortcoming in the project design project assumption and the lack of updating of the logical framework rather than as shortcoming in the action of the project stakeholder implement the project,negative
49,agency such as the bangladesh climate change trust fund require great attention because of -PRON- dual role as a contributor to and a source of internal fund for the implementation of the cip,negative
50,area in which the cip could make improvement include provide a forum for the prioritization of programme provide an opportunity for open and transparent discussion about the investment priority programme development quality programme implementation and monitoring coordination and synchronization of programme community and private sector consultation and provide a forum where propose government programme within the various ministry and -PRON- agency that contribute to the environment forestry and climate change sector could be make explicit,negative
51,the project design use time model that be not reflective of the actual time need to complete government of bangladesh activity such as the time -PRON- would take for the psimu to be staff by government of bangladesh civil servant and how long an environment forestry and climate change cip would actually take to be develop,negative
52,the initial project design be overly ambitious in -PRON- scope and objective,negative
53,pattern of discrimination in relation to the project the ministry of environment and forest and -PRON- agency and the cip and -PRON- project have not be identify analyse and response develop for,negative
54,however these knowledge product need to be well contextualize and disseminate for optimal use at decentralized level,negative
55,field staff need to be involve in the preparation of these knowledge product for proper contextualization and eventual utilization,negative
56,that say fao also need to strengthen the capacity of technical officer to mainstream gender in -PRON- work particularly through customize advice and support from gender officer and gfp in the decentralize office,negative
57,since governance be never clearly define in the programme -PRON- lead to the programme be spread too thinly,negative
58,however -PRON- be still too early and not yet clear if the work on the ipc chronic food insecurity classification scale and the nutrition scale will be widely adopt,negative
59,however the work on resilience be not integrate with other programming initiative such as social protection and sustainable agriculture,negative
60,wfp and ifad do not participate in the design,negative
61,well balance be need,negative
62,because fao be in the early stage of -PRON- strategic re organization the corporate environment be not yet conducive to fully support such a multi stakeholder and multi sector effort indeed the igghrp help facilitate some of the need corporate change,negative
63,igghrp also lack a strategic focus on a target governance space e.g. smallholder farmer and producer organisation or a theory of change make -PRON- difficult to maintain horizontal linkage across the outcome e.g. social protection link to resilience programming,negative
64,e process and use fao internal mechanism for m&e limited m&e capacity could account for weak monitoring of governance outcome change,negative
65,however the intend result be ambitious within the give time frame,negative
66,nonetheless there be scope to improve the coordination structure with the involvement of subregional training institution and commission,negative
67,as a result the development of technical guideline may be delay beyond 2017 especially in africa,negative
68,there be also little vertical coordination and communication within participate partner organization with the exception of the fao regional office for asia and the pacific rap,negative
69,field test the research result will well enable adaptation to specific country contexts and further increase country level capacity which can also benefit non funded region,negative
70,almost three quarter of the overall funding gap pertain to the lac near east and cis region while implementation in the africa region will not be affect due to the recent funding boost from the european commission,negative
71,however participation at the decision make level varie from country to country,negative
72,however diffusion of newly acquire capacity beyond the primary beneficiary be not obvious during the mte which could jeopardize the programme regardless of the positive sign of sustainability,negative
73,the funding gap usd 3.73 million at the global office level primarily affect the research component,negative
74,in asia pacific the funding gap be about usd 6.16 million 45 percent of the budget allocate for the region,negative
75,with the exception of fao none of the participate partner have contribute financially to the programme which raise the question as to whether there be enough interest to continue global strategy activity by implement partner after the current resource partner have cease to provide funding,negative
76,this represent a miss opportunity and could result in the continued neglect of water access issue in the application of gwg principle,negative
77,much remain to be do however with regard to alliance building beyond the technical water community as note above,negative
78,although outreach and communication be consider essential to reach target audience and to achieve the desire impact on national decision maker the draft communication strategy be not effectively implement,negative
79,the focus shift however to concentrate on the more technical aspect of gwg,negative
80,still a more inclusive process in identify topic in a wide agricultural rural nexus be need for well policy linkage and resource mobilization,negative
81,there be enhance coordination between ministry of agriculture and national statistics office nso but a lack of awareness about global strategy and -PRON- contribution remain which could affect resource mobilization,negative
82,in spite of advocacy communication and dissemination effort global strategy be largely unknown beyond -PRON- primary stakeholder,negative
83,national coordination mechanisms be set- up in several country but -PRON- may have to be revitalize for future use,negative
84,apart from engagement with global initiative use the ipc such as the global report on food crisis the gsp have provide limited support for utilization of the ipc,negative
85,factor negatively affect -PRON- usefulness include the geographic unit of analysis be too large and therefore insufficient granularity of analysis limited availability of datum and poor quality datum political sensitivity of the result and the challenge of translate the result into recommendation,negative
86,much more follow up support at country level be need,negative
87,data availability be a constraint particularly in country experience occasional pocket of acute food insecurity,negative
88,but -PRON- be infrequently cite as a source of information for decision making and be not currently inform policy,negative
89,view differ amongst gsp stakeholder about whether the ipc should be play an early warning role or not although this be clearly state in manual v3.0,negative
90,the gsu have maintain -PRON- independence at global level but in some country the ipc be overly identify with fao with implication for -PRON- perceive neutrality,negative
91,furthermore some knowledge product and service should be well design and more user orient in order to enhance -PRON- utility,negative
92,great internal cooperation and coordination would enhance -PRON- efficiency,negative
93,ao data analysis and learning resource be often disseminate through unrelated platform and channel,negative
94,furthermore opportunity to capitalize on successful experience be often miss,negative
95,some however could be even well tailor to the specific need of -PRON- target audience,negative
96,fao knowledge product and service be produce in a decentralized manner and generally operate on a shoestring budget,negative
97,however quality assurance procedure be apply inconsistently,negative
98,while most focus country be on the right course -PRON- be still too early to observe the impact of access to land on the local people and on reduce hunger and poverty,negative
99,this certainly reduce the visibility viability and authority of the nutrition strategy as a guide document within fao,negative
100,however the synergy that be hope for between the ex ags staff and the rest of the division have yet to fully materialize,negative
101,a review of post allocation indicate that esn have currently a comparable level of professional post 30 as agn use to have in 2012 2013 28 while the number of general staff post have be halve from 18 to 9 over the same period,negative
102,in fact esn have have a number of vacancy which -PRON- use to hire human resource on a short term basis through consultancy contract,negative
103,human resource and skill set be insufficient both to meet this grow demand and to cope with the challenge of a relatively new area of work require new skill and practical experience e.g. in inter sectoral policy dialogue planning and programming and relation with the private sector,negative
104,a nutrition trust fund set up by fao after the icn2 conference be never promote to donor and never accrue to,negative
105,those related to mainstreaming of nutrition in the field programme and policy work of the organization have see slow progress,negative
106,the institutional disconnect between ministry of agriculture and ministry of health and between the correspond un agency be still present in many country,negative
107,member country increasingly associate fao with nutrition as evidence by -PRON- request and priority express during the 2016 round of regional conference but fao do not always have the capacity to respond to -PRON- demand,negative
108,the lack of corporate wide approach to nutrition extend to monitoring and evaluation which be not systematically pursue in fao nutrition sensitive programme,negative
109,so far these challenge have predominantly be approach through direct nutrition intervention mainly implement in the health sector yet improve diet through well agriculture and food system so call food base approach potentially offer more sustainable solution to all form of malnutrition,negative
110,current effort in this direction should be expand to help team at headquarters and the different region learn from each other include horizontal learning from region to region,negative
111,however there be a potential overlap between output 1.1,negative
112,the organization should not limit -PRON- to a decline emergency crisis response portfolio which in many case e.g. in protract crisis rely on ill adapt short term humanitarian funding,negative
113,capacity appear less robust in disaster risk reduction and management insurance and cash base approach and almost nil in conflict and political analysis,negative
114,there be potential for deep integration and further synergy through exchange of datum set integration of geographic information system and the sharing of datum collection tool such as tablet and satellite datum link service,negative
115,at national level the degree of engagement in strategic programme 5 still depend much on the profile skill set and preference of individual fao representative rather than on the relevance of strategic programme 5 to the country context and government priority,negative
116,effort be be make to fill vacant position and hire new staff in key technical unit but this may not be enough,negative
117,this be because as fao expand -PRON- portfolio in emergency and rehabilitation activity the organization use humanitarian resource channel that be relatively easy to access than development funding,negative
118,most of the personnel work on strategic programme 5 national and international be hire under consultancy contract with extremely short contractual period,negative
119,fao lack a formal programme level connect the project and the country programming framework hence the recourse to country resilience strategy,negative
120,while this may be adequate for one off response to sudden onset disaster -PRON- have prove problematic when implement recurrently as be often the case in protract crisis,negative
121,many technical unit engage in resilience relate policy in a scatter manner,negative
122,in africa and the regional office for the near east and north africa the regional initiative be only fund by fao resource and therefore rather small and use to fund catalytic country level initiative,negative
123,so far many of these service such as the community animal health worker or farmer field school have not be aggressively promote by fao,negative
124,fao could strengthen -PRON- strategic position by deepen -PRON- involvement in resilience,negative
125,while silos be break within strategic programme 5 there be potential for more collaboration between strategic programme at headquarters,negative
126,seize the opportunity present by the current interest in resilience require continue and strengthen operational and technical capacity together with increase investment in resilience programming,negative
127,resilience programming be not fundamentally new to fao,negative
128,insufficient attention have be pay to knowledge management so far,negative
129,however there have be no systematic staff training in resilience programming and only modest effort towards the development of knowledge sharing network,negative
130,a thorough stakeholder analysis may have prevent these problem,negative
131,the logical framework and m&e plan however be never adapt to the new activity of the big2050 initiative,negative
132,component 2 activity relate to the bocaina mosaic come to a standstill around 2016 due to a misinterpretation of -PRON- attribution during project formulation,negative
133,argue that project outcome be not alter by this significant change no formal gef approval be seek for -PRON-,negative
134,all together the result of the component be consider moderately unsatisfactory,negative
135,the activity relate to the strengthening of the bocaina mosaic include the establishment of a permanent executive structure be largely base on a misconception at the time the project be conceive,negative
136,bod biological oxygen demand value have not be reduce,negative
137,the main flaw to be consider be the lack of a thorough previous stakeholder analysis and the lack of consideration of gender issue,negative
138,however at project conception -PRON- be wrongly consider that the mosaic be to have an executive character where in reality -PRON- be merely consultative,negative
139,change in fao regulation and procedure over the course of the project cause some implementation problem due to the require adaptation,negative
140,under component 2 bocaina mosaic activity come to a standstill due to lack of interest among -PRON- member,negative
141,conclusion 2,negative
142,conclusion 5,negative
143,at the time of -PRON- inception fao have limit or no field presence in the participate country relatively small national programme and have only recently start to establish -PRON- first central asia sub regional office in ankara,negative
144,the ftpp be design without a robust result framework or theory of change toc,negative
145,there be no procedure apply for ensure the relevance of project activity to the beneficiary,negative
146,ftpp be a highly fragmented programme consist of 28 small autonomous project which do not facilitate collaboration to any substantial degree,negative
147,with very few exception the implementation have not include partner that can facilitate result in the field,negative
148,despite the gender issue inherent in most project for example no gender analysis be conduct,negative
149,the output could be significantly improve particularly through a great focus on the need of beneficiary,negative
150,the output could have have a great impact by build on exist project or by be continue and expand by partner organization,negative
151,the draft policy and strategic plan be either not approve or the approval be still in process,negative
152,however the programme start without either a real design or result base framework,negative
153,in particular the bureaucracy involve contribute to serious delay in the implementation of the programme,negative
154,a demand drive programme with adequate ownership require significant involvement from stakeholder at both the regional and national level in programme design and planning,negative
155,most of the scatter and small project be unable to achieve impact in isolation as the challenge -PRON- address be often interdependent,negative
156,this be especially the case for field orient programme such as cattle production watershed management and home base nursery where the activity be develop around community organization,negative
157,the operational and financial framework be not very successful in establish an effective field programme,negative
158,in another example although the concept of environmental sustainability be build into the design of several project -PRON- be not integrate into the project activity,negative
159,long delay be experience in programme implementation and the delivery of project output,negative
160,the limitation in project funding and duration affect the scale and scope of the project output,negative
161,the ownership by ministry in recipient country differ but be generally limited,negative
162,the selection and approval process for project as conduct by fao and the government be find to be ineffective,negative
163,the programme aim to be demand drive,negative
164,the small project i.e. those with short duration and limited budget sometimes lack focus on what -PRON- could realistically achieve,negative
165,in a number of case a lack of institutional development limit the potential of technical intervention,negative
166,consequently strengthen decentralized office capacity to effectively engage with un country team will become increasingly important,negative
167,this will require great attention to the scale and impact of investment operation than merely step up resource mobilization for programme delivery,negative
168,at the same time -PRON- need to be package into more concrete programme intervention relate to major challenge and incorporate result chain and narrative align to the priority of resource partner and sdg target,negative
169,in this regard the 40 sdg target 20 interconnect action and 12 focus area for resource mobilization provide new and alternative opportunity to design flagship programme that be cross so from the outset,negative
170,the integration of cross cut theme have not be systematic with the exception of climate change,negative
171,the main shortcoming affect the relevance of the project evaluate be the decision to fund a large number of project through two different funding window at the same time,negative
172,furthermore the vast majority of immediate action project do not monitor the adaptability and productivity performance of pgrfa,negative
173,as a result the strategic action plan in most case could not be fully implement,negative
174,however the call for proposal focus primarily on food security with insufficient emphasis on nutrition also gender differentiated approach in project execution have not be sufficiently prioritize,negative
175,however the formulation of a large number of strategic action plan without clear funding source identify before project closure be not consider good value for money,negative
176,however some of the outcome set forth under component 1 and 2 be not achieve for example the conservation of endemic biodiversity include agrobiodiversity or the implementation of information system regard the state of biodiversity in the chimborazo reserve,negative
177,in addition the gadpch have limit capacity to directly execute large project and manage a wide range of participant as be evidence by -PRON- decision to assign the project under the environment coordination committee instead of the planning coordination committee,negative
178,the evaluation identify some weakness in particular the establishment of a comprehensive overview as regard land use planning and sustainable development in the province,negative
179,however the project do not apply the monitoring of the participation of woman or young people age 15 to 25 in the training event and in the different initiative implement or specific datum to determine whether the project have contribute towards improve -PRON- right such as for example -PRON- level of access to training and financial resource,negative
180,however take into consideration the significant budget cut in the country since 2016 -PRON- be probable that the level of replicability will be low in the next few year due to -PRON- high cost,negative
181,in particular the conservation and sustainable use of natural resource be mainly focus on the harvesting of water resource in the upper paramo basin and sub basin and the optimization of -PRON- use the application of a pilot model of compensation mechanism for the payment for environmental service psa,negative
182,other important factor identify be the absence of risk management in planning and the lack of monitoring of result back up by a communication strategy and an appropriate institutional arrangement gear towards reduce the inter institutional interaction difficulty experience particularly under component 2,negative
183,however the execution of some output complete in the last month of the project could experience sustainability difficulty as a result of not have a formal subsequent transfer of technical monitoring and take into consideration that the project do not establish some activity to support the conservation and the proper management of the paramo such as for example a system to monitor the outcome and tangible change at an environmental social and economic level,negative
184,however -PRON- have only manage to partially fulfil the high level objective in other word the development and environment objective of the project,negative
185,however -PRON- be necessary to extend the duration of the project by about two year and 20 percent of the gef fund be execute in the last six month,negative
186,in particular the high staff turnover in the opim the gadpch and the cantonal and parish dag the lack of clarification of the responsibility of the opim and of fao ecuador particularly at the beginning of the project after the change in opim staff in 2013 and after the mid term evaluation at the end of 2015 and the lack of monitoring of the outcome and risk management by the opim technical team to mitigate the problem associate with the slow execution of the project in time,negative
187,in term of the replicability of the infrastructure project -PRON- be find that the gadpch and the cantonal and parish dag have not be able to assess -PRON- cost efficiency to date17 in order to prioritize the work to be replicate in accordance with the ludp priority,negative
188,although the project be see as an important first step -PRON- do not possess adequate resource namely the time and budget to achieve the objective as plan in the project document,negative
189,only 2 percent of the target area be reach and despite implementation of most project activity no direct outcome be fully achieve,negative
190,the selection of the execute partner sodefor do not take into account -PRON- limited capacity to manage fauna and community live outside of forest area,negative
191,the limited implementation capacity result in delay implementation of certain activity,negative
192,this suggest that more institutional and individual capacity building awareness raising technical and financial support be need to ensure environmental and socio economic impact,negative
193,to this end fao should also ensure a focus on strengthen capacity to develop evidence basis for inform advocacy message and policy that include cost value of policy choice or of policy inaction for instance in relation to environmental sustainability or deforestation,negative
194,fao therefore need to more loudly share lesson from pilot project and from -PRON- experience and expertise,negative
195,a long term strategically orient approach to policy engagement by fao in collaboration with other member of the un country team and back by the fao regional office for asia and the pacific could provide a way to move away from an ad hoc approach to policy engagement towards a long term approach limit risk concern through partnership with un country team and other development partner,negative
196,give this approach there be equally a lack of clarity and mode of project financing both of which be associate with delay in activity onset,negative
197,-PRON- also limit the planned adaptive learning from resilience to climatic change,negative
198,a delay decision to procure service of a consultant to support the instituting of the livestock identification and traceability system lit be a miss opportunity for strengthen market and disease control regulation,negative
199,furthermore tail end famer already face water scarcity be deprive of this important intervention,negative
200,on the institutional capacity development strengthening and transforming community- base organization cbos and farm service centre fscs be not achieve to the extent that be plan under the project,negative
201,activity such as establishment of vegetable production unit fruit plant nursery fruit orchard and distribution of seed silos be expensive not very strategic and not reach to a broad range of beneficiary,negative
202,however the evaluation note that other mangrove consultation framework already exist for instance the cameroon mangrove network and the project could have focus on strengthen these network,negative
203,the project have not yet put in place a strategy to use the result of permanent plot monitoring after -PRON- closure,negative
204,however the final act of approval for the classification of these protect area either douala edea national park or ramsar site do not solely depend on the project,negative
205,furthermore the evaluation of protect area management effectiveness which be a requirement of this project and of gef project in general have not be carry out,negative
206,indeed the result and effect obtain appear to be low than expect,negative
207,however the study carry out by the project do not always highlight gender specificity,negative
208,the project could have improve -PRON- performance by add a lobby and political advocacy component in order to mobilize these high level political actor in -PRON- favour and improve result and output,negative
209,the report repeatedly highlight the weak involvement of the private sector as a major issue which be nevertheless a key actor as a user and potential polluter of mangrove ecosystem,negative
210,accord to the viewpoint of the various institutional actor and the beneficiary -PRON- this aspect remain the soft underbelly of the project 's achievement in term of the financial and human resource make available,negative
211,however the objective of strengthen resilience to climatic shock do not clearly translate in design and logframe e.g. in geographic targeting criterion in outputs/ activity no early warning system at village level no contingency plan,negative
212,however the design be not well balanced to ensure the adoption of a multisectoral approach in all jrp village and throughout the duration of the project the wash component cover a limited number of village in a single locality,negative
213,the need to follow up be to be expect and an exit strategy should have be anticipate include on orientation activity and budget at design stage,negative
214,the absence of capacity building plan for implement partner and local authority and of plan transfer of responsibility challenge the sustainability of the jrp see recommendation 2 and 3,negative
215,moreover some output 4 and 5 activity be monitor as a package through aggregate indicator that could not provide quantifiable evidence of what exactly be implement,negative
216,feedback to the community and project documentation adjustment to the cap be not clearly include in the design,negative
217,the revision of the cap by technical expert reduce potential ownership and buy in of the process by the community,negative
218,the initial breakdown of the budget by component be not update to include the priority define during community consultation or the increase in the number of village and the reduced number of target people even though these change have an impact on the need to be address by each of the four component,negative
219,agency specific procedure for partnership or procurement create some difficulty and reduce the potential achievement of an integrated and joint approach,negative
220,while this could have be an opportunity to strengthen the capacity of ministry to work together and develop multisectoral strategy jrp do not make the most of -PRON-,negative
221,this would have enable proper feedback from community on activity carry out during the year and ensure the update of action plan,negative
222,however behaviour change be a long term process and result need to be consolidate,negative
223,a reduction of the period dedicate to the implementation of output 2 to output 4 activity have have an impact on overall achievement,negative
224,a well assessment of the context to include a realistic number of target village from the outset and the inclusion of a pre established mechanism to answer climatic shock in the design would have ease the management of the jrp management and respect of the timeframe,negative
225,wait for a cap to be validate to start -PRON- implementation be superfluous and only delay the beginning of the activity,negative
226,this be due to a lack of investment with only 5 percent of the programme budget for wash and impact of flood but also due to difficult coordination with the aquaforeast project,negative
227,moreover while coordination within the jrp be already an issue -PRON- can be consider overambitious to ask the programme to coordinate with an external project,negative
228,wash component raise an issue of sustainability consider there be no effective water management committee no fee be systematically collect for most water source and locality service be weak,negative
229,however most of these effect would have to be assess at a later stage also consider that annual survey do not show clear overall improvement of livelihood at this stage,negative
230,field team could not ensure monitoring and follow up of activity to consolidate the achievement of the programme and this represent a risk for the quality of intervention as well as for -PRON- sustainability,negative
231,well preparedness and anticipation would have help to well respond to need and in particular to provide early assistance for livestock owner affect by drought,negative

307,however question remain about what the moderate end of the scale actually measure in some country and discrepancy between fie and the prevalence of undernourishment pou still require clarification,negative
308,the risk for fao be to find -PRON- unable to address legitimate technical concern about an sdg indicator -PRON- be custodian for,negative
309,-PRON- advocacy effort be mainly target statistician and other partner work with statistic,negative
310,this potential for disaggregation be only partially utilize to date most fie datum be collect at household rather than individual level which mean that disparity in access to food within the same household can not be assess,negative

354,land remain a contentious issue in all the fpam country and the impact of this on any similar project should not be underestimate,negative
355,local institutional capacity e.g. at village level remain low,negative
356,there remain gap in the quantification of the impact of project activity,negative
357,whilst the original design of the project acknowledge the complexity of deal with customary land tenure the lack of capacity and the complexity of develop mechanism for sustainable financing -PRON- nevertheless set target that be beyond the capacity of the project the country and local community to implement,negative
358,the circumstance face by the project during implementation in fiji be unanticipated and -PRON- impact delivery of the project for a period of at least six month and likely impact the project for an overall period of 9 to 12 month,negative
359,moreover neither document provide to the evaluation team during the final evaluation nor interview undertake with project team member indicate that the project deliberately address adaptation to climate change,negative
360,the effectiveness in produce protect area management plan and implement high- priority management activity be affect by the complexity of customary land tenure,negative
361,more attention should be pay to certain area that be critical for the achievement of national development goal e.g. income generation and job creation,negative
362,however in some area specific value addition or distinctive institutional expertise be not evident,negative

364,more effort should be make in the application of global norm to the local context and in share country experience with regional and global stakeholder,negative
365,the forthcoming cpf should develop an overall strategy and priority area approach that will help ensure synergy among intervention,negative
366,fao also utilize the knowledge with local institution in particular those under national agricultural research system by work with -PRON-,negative
367,while fao provide quality service in implement project -PRON- approach be not always efficient due to -PRON- institutional requirement,negative
368,insufficient attention to market aspect be partly due to the composition and dynamic of the project task force,negative
369,small scale project be most useful when use as a pilot activity or seed money for large initiative,negative
370,although the cpf acknowledge the importance of gender mainstreaming -PRON- be not always integrate at the operational level due partly to the absence of systematic gender review,negative
371,although there be an abundance of study analysis and assessment for evidence- base policy making in pakistan -PRON- be underutilize by decision maker,negative
372,fao have not yet integrate response to climate change into -PRON- programme,negative
373,further research awareness raising and strategy be need,negative
374,-PRON- should also work to modernize regulation and policy to create an enable environment for sustainable agricultural development in pakistan,negative
375,fao would need to transform and expand -PRON- partnership and delivery mechanism build on -PRON- core competency and address institutional and regulatory structurally important challenge,negative
376,this make -PRON- difficult for the government to absorb the material and act appropriately,negative
377,fao be invite but miss the opportunity to participate in the workshop,negative

383,effort to build the capacity of the non g20 participate country could have be more effective if base on an initial assessment,negative
384,the annual nature by tranche of dgf funding present some challenge,negative
385,since there be no dgf funding specific activity planning process beyond the result framework -PRON- be not possible to track execute activity against plan one and specific result or output against specific activity,negative
386,the main shortcoming affect the relevance of the project evaluate be the decision to fund a large number of project through two different funding window at the same time,negative
387,however the formulation of a large number of strategic action plan without clear funding source identify before project closure be not consider good value for money,negative
388,furthermore some overlap be identify among project in term of the country cover and the strategic action plan be formulate without information and datum flow from the immediate action project,negative
389,this have result in a large number of farmer discontinue the use of pgrfa distribute,negative
390,in the case of gender equality project proposal and implementation report mainly focus on report the number of female participant which in 11 of the 12 immediate action project average only 12 percent.3,negative
391,the evaluation identify only two case where the strategic action plan have secure adequate funding to implement -PRON- main action in the post project period 2014- 2016,negative
392,these have not be implement yet but the new aap framework appear to have some conceptual weakness,negative
393,for example the difference between the west bank and the gaza strip be not always account for in the design of project that target both area,negative
394,however more attention should be pay to the implication of the activity on beneficiary e.g. risk or trade off for beneficiary and the indirect effect of distribute asset,negative
395,while project claim to be implement resilience build activity these be often focus on asset building rather than address the underlie issue that create perpetuate or increase the vulnerability of the target population e.g. progressive erosion of natural resource or reduction of access to resource and labour commodity or service market,negative
396,notwithstanding solid partnership with key actor fao display weakness when partner with local non governmental organization ngos and community base organization cbos whose work be mostly limit to service provision regulate through letter of agreement loas,negative
397,presently the office rely on emergency work to cover -PRON- running cost and on a share of project budget reserve for administrative and operational cost,negative
398,the difficulty of access for staff travel between the wb and the g be a serious constraint to joint work and have the effect of isolate the office in the gaza strip,negative
399,inclusion and exclusion error in target limit the involvement of community in the identification and definition of targeting criterion,negative
400,where activity be less relevant this be link to some recurrent weakness of design,negative
401,training provide as part of the intervention receive mixed feedback,negative
402,the physical and institutional constraint of the palestinian authority together with the lack of preliminary beneficiary consultation and assessment of -PRON- need by fao have limit ownership and undermined sustainability of some capacity development activity sometimes this lead fao to emphasize achieve output rather than intervene on process that would instead ensure local ownership and sustainability,negative
403,no reference to early recommendation be find in project proposal and action plan and there seem to be no system in place to ensure that lesson be learn and mistake be capitalize upon,negative
404,the current method of target woman as beneficiary be not adequate and do not equate to gender programming,negative
405,ngos and ips would like to play a great role when work with fao and to be engage in a more equal partnership,negative
406,more could be do to factor in risk and protection at the community level and to protect and support livelihood,negative
407,this be due largely to the limited expertise of fao representation on climate relate issue and have be particularly the case in small island develop state sids,negative
408,regard funding possibility through the unfccc a significant lose opportunity have result from fao not have obtain accreditation for the adaptation fund though -PRON- be currently seek -PRON- for the green climate fund,negative
409,furthermore the market access dimension of food security and livelihood be not fully address,negative
410,few and small transboundary approach be find although increase region wide programme would be particularly relevant for sid,negative
411,however there remain substantial gap in gender mainstreaming particularly at country level due largely to the limited resource the agency have devote to -PRON- and the weak understanding of gender by technical staff,negative
412,globally fao recognize that climate change will adversely affect woman more than man but only one project in the 11 focus country visit focus on address the specific issue that woman face and develop -PRON- ability in decision making,negative
413,this be a miss opportunity for fao to strengthen -PRON- work in country and develop member country capacity,negative
414,where ngos have lead important climate change knowledge and advocacy network involve other major stakeholder fao have not participate although -PRON- information on the subject could be useful to -PRON-,negative
415,the agency have be less active organized and strategic than -PRON- need to be in utilize potential opportunity for funding and develop common agenda with donor member country and development organization,negative
416,at the same time give the generally slow implementation of all fao gef project there be a concern that the agency may not be able to contribute to ccam as much as expect through -PRON- gef portfolio,negative
417,generally speak and although there have be important exception and significant improvement in country office engagement over the evaluation period country office have not proactively and substantively interact with ministry of agriculture to understand and propose solution to national climate change issue as -PRON- relate to agricultural system and -PRON- have engage even less with ministry of environment the lead government agency on climate change and with other relevant public agency,negative
418,as fao no long focus solely on assist member country to increase agricultural production in the traditional sense the csa concept have not entirely reflect -PRON- work,negative
419,there have be a significant lack of clarity within fao on the meaning of climate change adaptation as -PRON- apply to project for emergency response drr and incremental climate change,negative
420,the evaluation find few partnership with knowledge organization at country level in which fao draw on the broad intellectual capacity of research institution or university with equal or great skill,negative
421,consider the central role of the private sector in agriculture and value chain there have be insufficient fao partnership with the sector on climate change,negative
422,although the uptake of knowledge among mushroom producer be high challenge such as the high cost of spawn and lack of starter capital prevent -PRON- from improve -PRON- outcome,negative
423,on the other hand although youth have be welcome to participate and benefit from the project activity the project design and implementation do not provide specific support to engage youth in agriculture,negative
424,on the other hand planning and coordination of intervention among project partner have not always be smooth result in less effective support to ffs community,negative
425,however some of the more recently implement project activity e.g. the knowledge management system ffs network have not yet create sufficient ownership and will need to be support far,negative
426,go forward additional and complementary support will be require to sustain the production increase result from the project support as well as some recently implement network activity,negative
427,although the project formulation and implementation have consider equity in the access to knowledge capacity and investment -PRON- do not initially address gender equality and gender empowerment as a result,negative
428,weakness in link information and coordination to fns policy process and outcome be identify,negative
429,furthermore the sequencing of strategy research on exist policy and the implementation of the information system after the training and institutional setup make -PRON- difficult to establish or recognize programme impact base on fns outcome,negative
430,however in a post training survey to evaluate progress on workshop topic test for competency be not monitor particularly at the organizational level include non state actor and environmental level where significant capacity development be envision in the programme document,negative
431,technical support and exchange visit however involve a relatively limited number of people,negative
432,this make -PRON- difficult to fulfill the intent of the programme outcome as reflect in the theory of change or programme document,negative
433,although the state level database and information management officer collect information on spreadsheet this do not resemble an intentional information system,negative
434,however fns strategy process be late to begin and therefore have not be complete by the time of the evaluation,negative
435,random action in local community cause delay that need to be quickly resolve to minimise delay,negative
436,sustainability of some livelihood result may also be doubtful mainly due to a lack of access for beneficiary in local area to the improved input demonstrate in train course,negative
437,the main implementation gap be minimal effort devote to livelihood support aim at encourage beneficiary household to diversify -PRON- livelihood activity and land rehabilitation work in upland watershed area in project province,negative
438,support for beneficiary to diversify farming system and improve -PRON- livelihood resilience receive minimal support from each project,negative
439,a dedicated capacity building component within the project design would have also be useful,negative
440,however increase livelihood as an objective in all three plan and adoption of eafm by the country will help to promote gender consideration in the management of trawl fishery,negative
441,gender and human right issue be not explicitly address in the rebyc ii cti design,negative
442,a number of operational issue relate to the implementation of the project such as the part time nature of the project regional coordinator the lead technical officer not be locate in the region and the lack of a dedicated editing and translation budget have a negative impact on project outcome and impact,negative
443,furthermore there be a need to capacitate the somali government on the ipc in order to create a high level of ownership among these institution,negative
444,the collaboration appear to be base on ad hoc informal or personal collaboration rather than strategic joint planning at management level this should be address during preparation for the next phase of fsnau,negative
445,the evaluation find that the collaboration between fsnau and few net have not result in add value or synergy e.g. with regard to inform humanitarian response,negative
446,the project do not adhere to the requirement define in the fao policy on gender equality,negative
447,problem be observe however in relation to the nutrition datum as the survey result be not comparable with result for other country,negative
448,in contrast the evaluation find the approach to agriculture too narrow include only cereal production thereby leave out important livelihood activity such as irrigation agriculture in pastoral society,negative
449,however even in the current phase there be a funding gap of approximately usd 5 million out of a total budget of usd 26.1 million the next phase will likely face similar funding issue,negative
450,there remain however a need to mainstream gender into the project design and to disaggregate gender in datum collection and analysis,negative
451,the evaluation however find a communication gap with regard to inform stakeholder particularly donor about the capacity development strategy and intervention,negative
452,however a number of issue remain unresolved in particular the income generate from project and the joining of operation financial and administrative function under a single unit,negative
453,nevertheless the lack of in depth monitoring and evaluation datum do not permit a comprehensive evaluation of the dissemination and uptake of result from the programme,negative
454,this be particularly so in the horse breeding project and be also a feature of the aquaculture project,negative
455,socio economic governance and management issue remain the responsibility of moewa to a great extent,negative
456,ksa universities of which there be many produce large number of suitably qualify graduate who could occupy many of the position currently take by international expert,negative
457,all project have problem with fao and moewa coordination and linkage,negative
458,for example several project address issue of irrigation but only to enhance irrigation efficiency or to use treated waste water for irrigation,negative
459,however in the implementation process the approach to capacity development be not comprehensive and the focus remain on provide training,negative
460,fao have pay little attention to strategic partnership at national regional and international level and there be mixed result at the project level regard long term partnership,negative
461,fao have inadequate capacity in the country to integrate social development issue poverty reduction and social inclusion and have no clear approach to mainstreaming gender issue,negative
462,similarly a review of programme document relate to gender reveal a lack of conceptual integration of gender analysis,negative
463,a major failing of the technical cooperation assistance programme be that -PRON- be operate as a series of independent project and therefore take no advantage of the benefit of information exchange and cooperation among staff of the various entity,negative
464,furthermore pro poor approach and gender mainstreaming be not always adequately consider at the design stage,negative
465,the lack of a function monitoring and evaluation system limit attribution of the result,negative
466,the breadth of the programme which have sometimes affect the quality of implementation represent a managerial challenge,negative
467,the lack of robust monitoring and evaluation system limit the availability of datum on and attribution of result,negative
468,more could have be do to evaluate interest at the individual level for project training and the lack of a proper need assessment limit the relevance of the project activity to shift national need,negative
469,more could have be do to evaluate interest in the institute in advance with a view to build engagement of potential beneficiary,negative
470,due to a lack of sectorial focus the resource need be not available and capacity be not develop in accordance with demand or in a holistic and sustainable manner,negative
471,the lack of business orient training for beneficiary negatively impact the financial viability of the farm,negative
472,many continue to rely heavily on external financial assistance in the form of free resource and material from the government and fao,negative
473,delivery of technical skill be often not accompany by the necessary functional skill particularly management skill at the individual and group level,negative
474,there be a lack of clarity of role and responsibility at many project site specifically in relation to the operation of the group,negative
475,poverty reduction objective have more linkage with social protection intervention and the support for productive enterprise to viable small and medium enterprise and value chain development,negative
476,this represent a miss opportunity to forge strong linkage with casp and other government programme such as the kwazulu natal agribusiness development agency and those in mpumalanga and other stakeholder at the national level include united nations agency civil society and the private sector,negative
477,this produce limited long term result for rural community,negative
478,when the project be terminate there be an impression that senior manager in provincial government need to be engage in accordance with the norm of conclude such project,negative
479,the lack of viability of many of the operation lead to increase debt burden against a background of a dwindle work capital base,negative
480,at every level the project structure require clear motivation or reward for good performance and penalty for poor or non delivery of desire outcome,negative
481,however there remain limited evidence that component i or ii be design and implement base on an adequate and timely need assessment,negative
482,however largely due to the poor timing of the training need assessment study there be limited evidence that the capacity development gap identify be address during the lifespan of the project,negative
483,the capacity development of farmer however remain overshadow by broad organizational challenge inherent in communally own farm include protract internal conflict within beneficiary group,negative
484,there be an emphasis on primary production with limited focus on the development of market linkage,negative
485,although the project endeavour to engage agricultural extension advisor at the municipal level the engagement mechanism at high municipal and provincial level do not enable planning to benefit from bottom up insight and contextual reality and limitation be often underestimate,negative
486,within the context of the beneficiary group cooperative be largely see as poverty alleviation and livelihood strategy for the poor not as avenue to create sustainable employment for rural household through small and medium enterprise development,negative
487,in addition the female producer be not well informed about how to package -PRON- product,negative
488,however the capacity be not develop to the require level as many training be provide by fao staff rather than the group leader,negative
489,however the level of coordination be still in the early stage and be not strengthen in a way that will continue after the project,negative
490,due to the evd crisis many of these activity as well as the district coordination mechanism be however disrupt,negative
491,with regard to the civil servant participate in the workshop only very limited capacity if any appear to have be create,negative
492,furthermore the project be only partly adhere to the fao policy on gender equality,negative
493,with regard to other normative product e.g. the ffs module 10 there be limited if any reference to the need of these group,negative
494,due to the evd a no cost extension be grant however even if some activity have be launch before the evd crisis condition have change and -PRON- be therefore not only a question of pick up the activity one year later,negative
495,however the secretariat be not yet fulfil -PRON- objective of work with and support decentralized district structure to facilitate the development of integrated district development plan,negative
496,at district level effort have be make to establish fns district coordination network however due to the interruption cause by the evd crisis the coordination network be still in the process of be establish and be not yet fully functional,negative
497,less have be achieve with regard to capacity development in relation to rtf with the exception of civil society representative the project do not seem to have lead to an increase capacity at district level and only partly at central level,negative
498,in indonesia both consultation with research institution and the letter of agreement process for ca validation could have be improve,negative
499,some of the recommendation make in the assessment could have improve gender response in project implementation,negative
500,late research involvement in indonesia weaken validation of ca for policy inclusion although this be finally underway in the no cost extension phase,negative
501,the lack of strategic planning on policy change couple with delay in start and progress the research validation of ca in indonesia late ca and ffs handbook in timor leste and an inadequate handover plan for ca equipment in timor leste prevent the completion of the enable environment outcome by the end of the project,negative
502,develop a thematic ca project cluster in two neighbouring country could have deliver significant and sustained synergy and some reduction in cost,negative
503,this reflect a gender- neutral rather than an empowerment approach to local gender role,negative
504,the fao and wfp co chair sometimes struggle to play a more neutral coordination role,negative
505,the office be gear towards development and nation building rather than emergency,negative
506,there have be very limited assessment of seed security in these area except in northern bahr el ghazal where the implementation of itfs be well adapt to address lack of access to seed,negative
507,a review of what be currently term ff and what constitute good practice in ffs would be timely and the production of guidance material to introduce an element of quality control to the range of intervention currently term ff,negative
508,this should now receive more attention through the apfs,negative
509,fao have not develop specific targeting criterion or guidance for -PRON- ips,negative
510,where there have be delay in implementation for seed distribution and itfs effectiveness have be undermine,negative
511,lesson need to be learn from this and other operation where delivery of seed have be late eg in central african republic,negative
512,vaccination of as many animal as possible as widely as possible risk leave herd susceptible to disease if herd immunity level remain low and drug supply be inadequate,negative
513,-PRON- be too early to judge the effectiveness of apfs for livestock activity as implementation be still at an early stage,negative
514,with a few exception there be little evidence of the roll out of training fao expect at beneficiary level,negative
515,in this context the role of the private sector deserve attention especially in state less affect by the conflict despite the challenge,negative
516,consultation with affected people in need assessment be more limited,negative
517,-PRON- be the responsibility of the over stretch m&e team with limited back stopping from the regional office or from hq,negative
518,for example -PRON- design of seed multiplication project could have take account of previous seed sector development,negative
519,the m&e unit be under resource which limit what -PRON- be able to do -PRON- ability to become more result and impact orient and to influence and inform programme team,negative
520,-PRON- do not yet have the capacity to provide technical support and oversight to a country programme that be respond to a major humanitarian crisis although faoss have benefit from technical expertise from other country office in the region,negative
521,as with most of the international aid community faoss be insufficiently prepare for the sudden outbreak of conflict in december 2013,negative
522,in practice limited staff capacity mean that this have be minimal,negative
523,the duplication of similar activity undertake by different development partner eu iica fao bilateral agency be further stretch the limited absorption capacity of small ministerial team result in a lack of continuity in implementation and follow up over time,negative
524,the function of the slc gender focal point be currently cover by a technical officer who have little time available to effectively carry -PRON- out,negative
525,there be however some variation in the degree of completion of these fsn policy,negative
526,however in practice the newly collect agricultural datum often remain within the control of the ministry of agriculture and be insufficiently share with economic actor and customer,negative
527,however in spite of a few very positive example the technical assistance in this area be insufficiently build upon and aggregate over time make -PRON- difficult to achieve a lasting impact,negative
528,there be also limited fao programmatic engagement on these issue apart from two case in dominica and antigua and barbuda detail in the report,negative
529,gender and youth be insufficiently address by fao programme,negative
530,however this report have note weak link with market and the private sector in a number of programme area such as food and feed system value chain and mis development and use,negative
531,nonetheless more focus and commitment to gender equality could have be give take into consideration the key role woman play in household food security and nutrition as well as in the economic activity relate to agriculture development in timor leste,negative
532,however insufficient financial resource and inadequate institutional decision could jeopardize the system regardless of the positive sign for sustainability,negative
533,gender be scarcely consider in the project design or during the project implementation,negative
534,however the project do not foresee any activity that could lead to well employment opportunity or the application of the acquire knowledge by student,negative
535,the lack of a tailor monitoring framework for the project make -PRON- difficult to closely monitor the implementation and identify measure to avoid delay,negative
536,the disproportionally large input of fao hq- base consultant may not have be the most efficient solution,negative
537,as a result of the large number of activity and time delay and the subsequent partial achievement of the output the last two outcome in which the professional community and government advocacy activity would have create an enable environment be only achieve to a limited extent,negative
538,the lack of engagement with government and limited employment opportunity for student which be leave out as an assumption will further hinder this contribution,negative
539,thus far the development of capacity outside of university enable environment have be minimal,negative
540,the turnover of consultant lead to a loss of institutional memory and additional time and effort,negative
541,further consideration of the local context would have enable more effective implementation,negative
542,both enaf and enact struggle with operational delay due to an underestimation of time need a disproportional focus on develop and revise the enact course at the expense of other activity such as dissemination and advocacy and capacity issue with the partner,negative
543,however there be often little coordination across sector at country level and the infrastructure build for sow reporting and monitoring often collapse after report submission,negative
544,technical unit have invite researcher to contribute chapter to flagship report for little or no compensation,negative
545,while fao have attract a grow amount of extra budgetary funding for grfa activities these voluntary contribution have not increase proportionately with the volume of work,negative
546,however opportunity exist for improved coordination e.g. between the treaty and fao unit deal with pgrfa as in the case of the global partnership initiative for plant breeding capacity building gipb which could have benefit from be well integrate in an overall policy framework on sustainable use,negative
547,while fao have maintain -PRON- unique role as a neutral policy forum for grfa other institution some grow out of fao have enter the field and fao have lose some visibility and support to new initiative,negative
548,opportunity for further coordination exist for example between itpgrfa and fao unit deal with pgrfa as in the case of gipb which could possibly have benefit from be well integrate into an overall policy framework on sustainable use,negative
549,in many country reporting arrangement be not institutionalize and coordination across sector be not develop,negative
550,focal point on plant animal forest or aquatic genetic resource be seldom engage in cross sectoral coordination arrangement for sow reporting often dissolve after report submission and have to be develop again each time,negative
551,at the same time through cgrfa fao be give the mandate for additional sow report aquatic genetic resource and biodiversity be currently under preparation in addition to the three already finalize sow and cgrfa have commit to the third plant genetic resource and the second forest genetic resource sow report,negative
552,many aspect of grfa work require a long time horizon as legislative and regulatory change concern the conservation and management of grfa e.g. access and benefit- sharing or intellectual property right often involve slow political process,negative
553,while this assumption be highly relevant in the context of somalia a more detailed explanation on the specific target group possible livelihood and diversification strategy in each livelihood zone could help the programme team to refocus some of -PRON- intervention,negative
554,at the same time such initiative be challenge and -PRON- be important to take into account the inherently conflictual process at play,negative
555,this appear to be a miss opportunity as the consultation have the potential to provide very useful information for programming,negative
556,in practice this mean that fao often encourage wfp to intervene in the same area as a way to provide a critical mass of support over several season,negative
557,however in one locality baki somaliland challenge relate to market access result in producer incur high transport cost and high perishability risk,negative
558,a contribute factor be that fao also lack an organization wide definition of the programme approach as well as a broadly agree upon rationale as to why -PRON- may be an improvement over the project approach,negative
559,many donor state that intrinsically -PRON- see the benefit to a programme approach e.g. more cohesive nature of planning but that -PRON- do not impact -PRON- direct relationship funding or otherwise with fao,negative
560,many respondent explain that fpmis continue to be too cumbersome for the need of the programme approach,negative
561,however this potential still need to be translate into concrete result,negative
562,to date this have yet to be prove,negative
563,while this may indeed build ngo capacity the long term impact and result be unclear,negative
564,the programme offer a long list of activity but these do not seem to contain novel implementation practice to take advantage of the transformative potential that the resilience agenda may have have,negative
565,-PRON- be difficult to see how one officer who be not even a full time staff member of the programme can realistically provide the attention and support need for a programme of such scale and complexity,negative
566,the evaluation have find evidence that intra community conflict arise as a result of some programme activity focus on natural resource management,negative
567,question can also be raise in relation to the sustainability of benefit of cfw intervention on community asset although field assessment indicate much appreciation for the training offer on how to manage and maintain the infrastructure construct or rehabilitate through cfw,negative
568,also seasonal wfp food distribution and -PRON- repercussion on grain price as indicate by a number of -PRON- community level respondent represent additional constraint on the ability of agricultural producer to obtain profitable price at the market,negative
569,many of the corporate tool require to implement under a programme approach do not exist yet,negative
570,the lack of a joint beneficiary database or other mechanism e.g. joint planning feeding into programme and field level coordination among agency that allow for assurance that all household receive the input from each agency make -PRON- impossible for the claim to be prove,negative
571,engagement with somali community by management and nairobi level staff be constrain by the security situation and link programme design decision making to ccap and seasonal calendar remain challenging,negative
572,today however the presence of the federal government and strengthening of federal member state may call for a reflection by fao somalia on the role that emerge government institution may assume in service delivery,negative
573,however the nexus between conflict and natural resource management be not give sufficient attention in programme implementation,negative
574,the existence of a nearly two year gap in a top leadership position have have negative impact on the fao somalia programme in term of funding teamwork and capacity to forge change,negative
575,there be however no indication that donor coordination be impact by the transition to the programme approach,negative
576,however not all three un agency work at the same level e.g. household community school and target the same people be a highly complex exercise especially as each agency already have ongoing operation before the development of the jrs and the jrs do not result in new programme but only the reformulation of pre existing intervention,negative
577,but to outsider donor most notably there have always be an expectation that un agency be collaborate in the field to ensure that no duplication occur and all comparative advantage be take,negative
578,however the implication of these change role for the programme remain unclear,negative
579,change in the governance system underway since 2012 will affect the modality of intervention on the ground,negative
580,while sap development be highly consultative participatory and reflect a consensus of the eight boblme country the sap do not convincingly define a set of strategy by which the priority issue will be address,negative
581,-PRON- be evident that the majority of the identify issue be common to the boblme country rather than strictly transboundary -PRON- do not necessitate all the bay of bengal country act together to address -PRON-,negative
582,the substantial review work should have be draw to a more effective conclusion provide guidance on future strategy for effective work in this field include specifically how this may be address in the sap,negative
583,no specific regional mpa action plan be prepare and no separate boblme mpa project be develop,negative
584,the evaluation conclude that policy work should have be integrate with the work on management strategy e.g. icm critical habitat mpa fishery,negative
585,however no specific action plan or recommendation be prepare and -PRON- seem little far direct work be do on policy harmonisation,negative
586,this forum be not form and the rfmac be defer as effort be put into develop ecosystem approach to fishery management eafm capacity,negative
587,accord to the project document prodoc the five component comprise 13 sub component and 150 action evidence the complexity of the project activity and pose challenge to management,negative
588,in addition the logical frame indicator refer to the general objective and as such be to a great extent beyond the project control and the project contribution to the objective be not measure,negative
589,this have hinder the due appropriation of the project,negative
590,the project develop with the gef financial resource and aim at the conservation of biodiversity and protect area should use the mett as one of the cus monitoring tool,negative
591,however -PRON- remain a weak than -PRON- should face difficulty regard -PRON- structuring and work reduce -PRON- effectiveness,negative
592,the attribution of the project and -PRON- partner be unclear partially due to the limited identity of the project,negative
593,regard direct and indirect mitigation i.e. through the support to intervention on threat consider to be critical and the organic pollution from enterprise in the municipality the datum analysis perform by the evaluation team show that the action of coordination and partnership with the responsible officer at municipal level should be reinforce,negative
594,the public awareness raise action and environmental education propose by component 4 be virtually uninitiated,negative
595,as regard procedure and action orient to reach the specific objective of enhance the institutional capacity on environmental planning and management on ecosystem ground at municipal and regional level despite the execution and support to a wide range of activity relate to ecosystem the institutional training activity and above all the training to group and member of forum and collegiate body still require greate effort and continuity,negative
596,finally the evaluation of the big project activity conclude that the action on sensitivity public awareness about the importance of the result of the big ecosystem integrate management demand effectiveness base on an information communication and dissemination plan,negative
597,there be little understanding of reach beyond the people directly involve,negative
598,however cip be uneven in clarify the extent to which these issue would be address through improve planning advocacy and monitoring,negative
599,the evaluation find relatively strong evidence that multi sector and multi- stakeholder approach have bring about increased awareness of nutrition issue and improve priority setting in the eight country evaluate and that reach play a role in this,negative
600,less progress be make on investment case and this plan output be remove from the priority in view of other initiative such as cost of hunger profile,negative
601,however plan in all eight case remain unimplemented because funding be lack,negative
602,along with other partner the initiative contribute to significant enhancement in institutional capacity although sustainability can not be guarantee,negative
603,country- level stakeholder have differ opinion as to whether reach should or could have a coordinate function among united nations agency,negative
604,however across all country and stakeholder group reach be not strongly associate with have specifically advocate for equity and gender or with have progress on the agenda in this area,negative
605,there be some loss in programming efficiency because of delay in the placement of reach facilitator in all country,negative
606,in neither case be there a specific cost analysis to address these perception,negative
607,also note be the need for a more strategic and cross- sectoral reach steering committee strong induction and support to facilitator during start up and clarity with regard to country level process,negative
608,most global stakeholder know little about reach,negative
609,however there be limitation to apply a standard model that be not sufficiently attune to local reality under tight timeframe,negative
610,however there have be an element of overshadowing by the sun movement which have contribute to reach be relatively less know and understand,negative
611,the reach theory of change do not take sufficient account of factor from outcome to impact level such as the importance of high level political commitment from government the political economy of the united nations and the lack of clear accountability and incentive for support within the united nations,negative
612,in a crowd global landscape the existence of reach continue to be question by some nutrition actor,negative
613,there have be insufficient attention to the effect on the sun movement when reach end,negative
614,the validity of the reach theory of change be challenge by major assumption from the outcome to the impact levels.9,negative
615,in particular collaboration among united nations agency at the level require for bring about the envision change be consistently weak in part because of an absence of incentive for collaboration,negative
616,the intended two to three year year catalytic phase of reach be insufficient,negative
617,give the support that reach have provide to sun at the country level strong concern be express that sun will likely be affect by the transitioning of reach to new modality especially if facilitator position be discontinue,negative
618,the achievement and weakness of reach reflect the quality of -PRON- design and implementation,negative
619,ao have be unable to provide a sufficiently clear explanation of why empre be the good approach to tpds and fst across all component which have have implication at the level of result,negative
620,the rapid onset of emergency response initiative be less sensitive to gender dimension which probably reflect the press need to focus on the rapid onset of disease outbreak or threat during an emergency,negative
621,this reliance have coincide with a reduction in the breadth and depth of donor funding,negative
622,the new and relatively poorly funded and under staff component forest health and aquatic animal health tend to focus on preparedness and response activity,negative
623,these cut have result in reduce in house expertise in many priority area for empre approach,negative
624,the capacity to deliver empre component continue to be reduce and be insufficient to meet demand,negative
625,fis performance have remain behind with regard to the livestock sector,negative
626,in order to optimize the contribution of afis output towards decision making the fsc be to be further empower and the food security technical secretariat fst need to be move from the nbs to the fsc secretariat,negative
627,however in south sudan the food security information gap remain vast,negative
628,the use of afis limited resource need to be prioritize,negative
629,datum generate be not adequately disaggregate by gender,negative
630,information system be not yet ready to be run solely by government which need continue capacity development,negative
631,however some constraint still exist at the national level in relation to institutional readiness result in the delay implementation of technical and operational management decision,negative
632,however a more targeted focus may be require in the future which take into account the financial incentive of those actor involve in enterprise development,negative
633,the gender perspective need to be address at the fao office level as well as across programme and intervention at the country level,negative
634,a full time gender expert should be hire if that be not possible in the short term the slc should provide guidance at the subregional level,negative
635,prior to 2013 mofp be challenge by the absence of fns policy through which the national requirement could be address,negative
636,among the possible post harvest loss strategy the application of cold chain principle be not well understand by farmer e.g. storage room with air conditioning,negative
637,a more active role that include work and engagement on the ground with potential new partner namely the private sector and the ngo sector will be instrumental in sustain the new biennial cpf consolidate the work in motion,negative
638,this be due to a lack of resource but also to the fact that the country office fail to take an active position on these topic,negative
639,at the same time this effort at alignment remain quite formal and be less evident at the project level,negative
640,however the format of the document and the process through which -PRON- be produce could be improve and -PRON- goal remain too ambitious,negative
641,fao rarely provide direct technical assistance for other agency and be sometimes perceive as not be able to play an advocacy role on sensitive but important issue,negative
642,most of -PRON- be promote through regional project which be often develop with only limited input from the country office,negative
643,however there be room for further strengthening of partnership particularly those just begin with civil society and the private sector,negative
644,however most activity concentrate on training individual rather than address the organisational capacity or create an enable environment,negative
645,staff have not be systematically brief or train on the topic and what be aim to be achieve in this aspect be unclear,negative
646,there be too many project that be too small and this affected efficiency and potentially wide impact,negative
647,this inevitably affect the quality of -PRON- work,negative
648,the design of some project and activity be not inform by a strong understanding of the context and lack a corresponding theory of change to bring about long term more significant change,negative
649,the total output be rather limited however which be compound by gap in dissemination and the lack of a proper communication strategy,negative
650,fao focus largely on support at the national level although there be a great need for support at the provincial and district level,negative
651,generally the work to support change at the government level be more successful than the work aim to make an impact in the field,negative
652,for emergency operation this be consistent with the finding of previous evaluation,negative
653,finally there be key area of work in which fao provide critical support and have a great potential to continue play a central support role but where opportunity be miss,negative
654,project implementation at the community level be find to be less than optimal,negative
655,however project outcome could have be improve by involve other partner in support a self sustained network of nutrition educator at an early stage,negative
656,in the case of enaf a large proportion of the delay come as a consequence of the delay face by enact,negative
657,the disproportionally large input of fao hq- base consultant may not have be the most efficient solution,negative
658,as a result of the large number of activity and time delay and the subsequent partial achievement of the output the last two outcome in which the professional community and government advocacy activity would have create an enable environment be only achieve to a limited extent,negative
659,the lack of engagement with government and limited employment opportunity for student which be leave out as an assumption will further hinder this contribution,negative
660,as a result the only potential effect on gender equality be unintended namely the increase of attractiveness of nutrition study to future male student,negative
661,although adoption of the course in pilot university seem likely at this time more effort be need to anchor enact approach within organization,negative
662,this result in miss opportunity for link to government and community scale up and enable a lasting impact,negative
663,however the project do not foresee any activity that could lead to well employment opportunity or the application of the acquire knowledge by student,negative
664,gender equality and the inclusion of woman be not sufficiently include in the project design or implementation and no gender analysis be conduct,negative
665,at a number of point -PRON- have emerge that ilo constituent at national level often lack capacity sometimes interest in the area of extend the social protection floor,negative
666,internally this will probably involve introduce change to the current configuration of technical support in the various programme link -PRON- to employment policy development with the aim of improve the coherence of ilo policy message at country level,negative
667,repeat assistance to country under the same outcome indicator and country programme activity under overlap outcome indicator do not adequately reflect the support and progress be make within the broad policy cycle,negative
668,however the reciprocal support could be reinforce to achieve a clear understanding of the service and tool that be require to meet the condition set out in the convention,negative
669,this be partly due to national budgetary constraint and internal government coordination issue,negative
670,country case study show that this be not automatic and situation can arise where specific group end up in disadvantageous situation,negative
671,however the ilo should improve the impact and sustainability of -PRON- strategy and capacity by articulate a long term vision of how country can support employment policy through all stage of the employment policy cycle,negative
672,the exist indicator framework for the strategic objective on employment do not support clear understanding of country level outcome achievement and progress within broad ilo employment policy initiative which may reinforce internal fragmentation,negative
673,the impact of this programme at this stage at national level therefore remain potential rather than actual,negative
674,on the other hand the programme have in several instance work at arm length with some of the department concern,negative
675,at present -PRON- be not clear who outside of the office have right of access to what,negative
676,there be a risk that a considerable amount of dedicated work will be waste and the intellectual capital in which the ilo have invest will be squander,negative
677,external donor to the programme appear to not have be demand in -PRON- monitoring expectation,negative
678,for example a flagship publication7 put out in september 2004 be issue as a ses product rather than an ilo endorse set of policy however with little clarity as to why this distinction be be make,negative
679,there be little evidence however that much of the analytical work have be convert into actionable policy recommendation,negative
680,furthermore an innovative5 programme explore issue of potentially great importance for the ilo have be run without any visible monitoring system to show how the innovation be evolve in the light of experience and to inform senior management about consequent development,negative
681,interaction with the international advisory board set up at the outset to help the programme appear to have flag after several years6,negative
682,at this moment the programme appear to have lose momentum within the ilo and to be on the verge of dissolution,negative
683,there be little evidence that the management system of the ilo provide the supervision necessary to monitor and give feedback on this largely exploratory research programme or to attenuate the tension that may arise between a unit that be potentially redefine organisational practice and the way that exist programme and unit may be expect to work in the future,negative
684,however while the finding should not necessarily be generalize to the entire portfolio of technical cooperation tc project case study indicate that ilo assistance be not always direct toward key issue that impinge on the ability of the labour inspectorate to carry out -PRON- duty and enforce the law such as the limitation of the central authority limit the capacity of court to adjudicate case lack effective mechanism for collect penalty and lack robust case management system and reliable labour inspection statistic,negative
685,however some aspect of design could be improve primarily with respect to the scope of engagement and sequence of activity,negative
686,from a broad institutional perspective while the office have establish planning and control system some deficiency be apparent,negative
687,in interview conduct as part of this evaluation constituent offer different assessment of progress on compliance,negative
688,while ilo seek to support member state in keep with international standard as reflect in convention nos,negative
689,howe- ver the likelihood that improvement in the capacity of labour inspectorate will be sustain varie across country depend on the extent to which change have be codify in policy procedure and system as well as the degree of political commitment institutional leadership and ongoing budget support,negative
690,however result vary across country and lack of consistent datum limit analysis,negative
691,there be several reason for this a professional and cultural divide between the development staff implement programme and the lawyer in the normes department with weak incentive to work together more coherently an almost total preoccupation in term of work load with the supervisory system by staff in the normes department difficulty by staff in other technical area in understand the legal process of il and continue difficulty in some programme area more than other in integrate il into technical cooperation,negative
692,however this and other outward look activity of the office be curtail principally by the overwhelming attention give to service the supervisory system,negative
693,make the link between ilo support and satisfactory outcome will always be an imperfect science,negative
694,however this be where the implementation of il outside the formal sector must make progress if -PRON- be to benefit a large proportion of the population,negative
695,one must recognize that the resource of the office be not sufficient for all of the mandate and action -PRON- be request to assume,negative
696,the evaluation conclude that across the office more work be require to satisfactorily mainstream the il,negative
697,some mean of generate more field experience and understanding of field condition among norme department staff would bring benefit overall to tc programming and to the efficiency of the supervisory system,negative
698,the challenge to coordinate the technical cooperation and integration of il identify more than twenty year ago still remain,negative
699,extend the il into the informal economy be a considerable challenge with none of the modality propose by the office so far make great headway,negative
700,this occur despite some inconsistency in high level strategy statement orient action towards the gap identify through supervisory mechanism,negative
701,however as long as the fprw outcome be mirror in separate organizational unit the 2008 declaration 's policy call for synergy be the only overriding incentive for manager to blend and combine outcome link regular budget rb financing,negative
702,these vary in depth and scope from project to project,negative
703,these linkage be not uniform and be not always monitor or acknowledge but -PRON- either do occur or have the potential to occur,negative
704,there be no coherent strategic justification for the prioritization of different fprw principle nor should there be since ilo policy see constituent demand as the main driver of dwcp content despite the obligation in the 1998 declaration,negative
705,positive development reflect the office 's support for improvement in the realization of fprw may well occur at a level that be not suit to supervision in term of ratified convention,negative
706,rating in the evaluation 's survey of office director and constituent be more mixed with some unsatisfactory level,negative
707,these effort be constrain where p&b outcome and rb resource that flow with -PRON- correspond with organizational unit,negative
708,this assessment be very obvious when resource be present in term of outcome 14 15 16 and 17,negative
709,collaboration be possible but be base on the pragmatic self interest of the organization involve,negative
710,on examination -PRON- be find that not all global outcome strategy be orient to the need express by constituent globally or to the gap identify through supervisory mechanism,negative
711,the country case study and survey result show mixed result in term of the integration of fprw principle into united nations un programming document,negative
712,institutional factor be report to limit real operational synergy and successful case may be unique,negative
713,in fact resource be be allocate to fprw support but be not recognize as such because of the way project be link to cpos,negative
714,there be clear imbalance in extra budgetary resource with those available for the elimination of child labour lead other fprw category although child labour have attract substantially less resource in recent year,negative
715,currently global product be infrequently use as a mechanism for improve efficiency i.e. provide common fprw support to constituent globally,negative
716,however the fact that element be develop individually to comply with monitoring requirement do not necessarily respond to this prerequisite as -PRON- do not transmit the deep understanding need to strengthen sustainability,negative
717,however no specific approach have be take to the implementation of a plan as guide by the key element specify in the ilc resolution in 2004 which call for an office wide approach,negative
718,moreover -PRON- prevent the establishment of a common vision,negative
719,however a common strategy for all sector of the office aim at achieve the long term objective of the resolution have not be develop,negative
720,to this end planning of specific activity for the implementation of the overall strategy or the sub strategy would be need,negative
721,this indicate that there may not be a problem with migration tool per se but with -PRON- placement as a crosscut issue in the generation of integrate programmatic framework embody by the dwcp,negative
722,ilc resolution programme and budget reflect the ilc conclusion on the need to mainstream activity and strengthen the international migration programme,negative
723,the consequence be that despite continue regard for -PRON- expertise and confidence in -PRON- approach and tool the ilo be not sufficiently present in operational activity in the field of international labour migration,negative
724,there be a clear gap to be fill by a comprehensive office wide internal strategy paper that formally recognise the cross cut nature of the labour migration issue which require a designation of responsibility to all part of the office so that everyone be require to consider -PRON- in -PRON- work,negative
725,however there be room for further cooperation with member of the gmg and other international and regional organization,negative
726,this seem to exclude the many other activity under the other 3 strategic objective of the office,negative
727,enhance the coverage and effectiveness of social protection for all as define as outcome 3b.2 in the 2006 2007 biennium and be list as intermediate outcome,negative
728,migration be a crosscut issue that fall under the various sphere of action of the ilo but the current programme and budget reporting mechanism make -PRON- nearly impossible to obtain information on expenditure realize by the different sector in support of this activity,negative
729,ideally the strategy should have an implementation plan with indicator milestone and target,negative
730,relevant international labour standard on migration be not well reflect in dwcps accord to analysis conduct by the evaluation team,negative
731,still there be a number of interview response state that ilo have lose a significant amount of ground in osh relate global issue,negative
732,strong regional disparity should be consider as a factor in future prioritization process figure 3,negative
733,priority be be give to build government and local organizational capacity to develop and implement policy change that can be link to the ratification of ilo convention and to the application of osh standard and code of practice,negative
734,in general tc project would benefit from more safework involvement during the identification and design phase to ensure more emphasis be place on capacity building and sustainability,negative
735,only a few provide detail on situational analysis client and outcome analysis identification of strategy and assumption management plan and implementation process,negative
736,in addition progress reporting and evaluation be not consistent in assess progress against objective i.e. no consistency of achievement between p&b document and programme implementation report for outcome 6,negative
737,howvere measurability and quantification be well the close -PRON- come to the implementation of convention recommendation and protocol,negative
738,constituent and expert also note a lack of resource and product relevant to middle- and low income country,negative
739,however the information flow between project field office and headquarter be not clear and often dilute accountability for delivery,negative
740,some of -PRON- such as the osh management guideline only show an impact year or even decade after -PRON- introduction,negative
741,as mention for the 19 convention under the osh heading accord to the website structure 39 ratification have be count,negative
742,the ratification figure for africa the arab state and particularly asia represent 21 of all member state and show only 7 of the osh convention,negative
743,reliable datum on occupational accident and disease be a necessary precondition for impact assessment and prioritization of osh activity,negative
744,evidence gather through this evaluation indicate that safework could have improve the efficiency of osh activity through well coordination and communication between field and headquarters staff and project management,negative
745,there be significant limitation in national level datum collection monitor system workplace level awareness particularly in under serve sector such as agriculture small business and the informal economy and quality and report on inspection,negative
746,an assessment of the immediate impact of safework product and activity be difficult,negative
747,while ilo intervention such as well work and well factory could turn partner country into ethical sourcing option for global buyer and consumer and lead to improvement in the more visible or physical problem there be a number of labour right issues12 that remain unaddressed,negative
748,in addition the strategic management module do not allow the contribution make by the various ilo unit to be measure in a systematic manner,negative
749,each strategy have a unique set of sub issue that have far reach implication,negative
750,-PRON- be questionable to hold sector accountable for the indicator contain in the p&b while the work to be do for sectoral activity be plan under a different and autonomous procedure over which -PRON- have little control,negative
751,there be in fact little in the way of a cogent strategy to achieve outcome 13 at least in the generally accept sense of the word,negative
752,however the difficulty of value -PRON- sectoral work which be by and large normative in nature may preclude the ilo from be able to demonstrate the comparative advantage of -PRON- sectoral work in the un development system of the future,negative
753,this incoherence may have lead to inconsistency and error in reporting,negative
754,more work however need to be do,negative
755,the evaluation team be therefore put in the invidious position of evaluate strate- gic performance with a lack of clarity about strategy and with poorly define performance indicator,negative
756,while skill development have clear synergy with other crosscut work of the ilo the p&b process in place at the time the evaluation be carry out may have create a disincentive for collaboration,negative
757,give the high demand and need however further guidance may be need on organizational priority include geographical focus,negative
758,this lack of coherence and alignment could have lead to inconsistency and error in reporting as country office may have be face with the difficult choice of either adhere strictly to the strategic policy framework or adjust -PRON- reporting to fit well with the global result framework,negative
759,nevertheless a number of constraint to operational efficiency and effectiveness be identify through the survey include issue relate to access to technical expertise time require for internal decision making and funding include adequate access to both financial and human resource,negative
760,this be observe by the evaluation team which cite case where the sustainable result for individual be positive although the sustaina- bility of the intervention -PRON- be not certain,negative
761,however the field visit do not find much hard evidence of this,negative
762,a number of significant constraint to operational efficiency and effectiveness be identify through the survey,negative
763,an examination of expen- diture on skill by country raise some question about relative return on investment,negative
764,however no datum be available on the actual number of country assess as have attain this goal,negative
765,the fact that evaluation topic be set on a yearly basis have impede both use and consultation,negative
766,-PRON- be the only un system organization to follow this pattern,negative
767,however there be little effective connection between evaluation and result base management within the office,negative
768,there have be train initiative but the result have be uneven and there be an express need for additional training at all level include for stakeholder,negative
769,at the same time the full potential of institutional learning from the evaluation have not yet be realize,negative
770,there be little connection between the high level evaluation and result base management represent by the strategic policy framework biennial programme budget or programme implementation report,negative
771,as with the accountability objective the iee find that use of the evaluation for management purpose be uneven,negative
772,a second issue be the nature and unpredictability of exis- te donor funding for social protection which often result in rather small short project that be not conducive to support long term process of change,negative
773,gender integration differ across country programme but generally lack explicit focus and monitor where there be no specialized gender support capacity,negative
774,the available datum do not allow a comprehensive assessment of the achievement of these goal,negative
775,however country and global operation be to a large extent finance through technical cooperation resource,negative
776,to date few ilo- support country level decent work strategy consider private sector enterprise development beyond the potential for enterprise level job creation,negative
777,the review of the project however show that transition from a largely technical cooperation approach focus heavily on training take time and may not be as readily finance by donor,negative
778,without this ilo country office tend to respond to short term and pragmatic approach to enterprise development which government demand and donor fund tend to overlook opportunity for long term and more systematic change in the hope of offer simple solution to complex problem,negative
779,a more concentrated effort and more target through sector community and vulnerable group would add focus increase visibility and potentially have a high impact,negative
780,the dependency on two donor however pose uncomfortable risk for this promising area of work which could flounder if funding be not sustain,negative
781,the work to promote enterprise association and cooperative enterprise be find to have great potential but be currently underdeveloped in large part due to limited fund and as yet too few case of cooperative approach be integrate into small enterprise development technical cooperation,negative
782,there be also a need to reduce external and internal user barrier and to integrate content and message to encompass the broad decent work agenda,negative
783,however the level of effort across the various indicator have be uneven with more effort and resource focus on entrepreneurship project and programme than on other pillar,negative
784,there be currently no clear orientation and coordination within the office on how the sustainable enterprise strategy could tap such resource in the long term for small enterprise strategy development at the country level,negative
785,this engagement need to go beyond private sector partnership and the office be struggle to articulate an actionable strategy,negative
786,-PRON- be weak in term of explicit development orient objective reduce -PRON- value add and relevance as a framework for the implementation of ilo tc during the period in question,negative
787,the low level of coherence be find in country that do not have formal ilo representation,negative
788,in none of the case review be the dwcps cost and anchor in budget,negative
789,however -PRON- be not clear whether the overhead charge by other agency and ngo be an accurate or realistic reflection of -PRON- administrative cost or whether -PRON- include the same element in -PRON- calculation as the ilo when determine support cost,negative
790,these be mostly associate with delay in recruitment or procurement,negative
791,this result in infrequent or insufficient field mission particularly with regard to country portfolio and policy development and result in miss opportunity,negative
792,overall dwcps tend to be conceptual document consist of broad sectoral analysis follow by pro- pose priority with outcome and indicator,negative
793,there be substantial routine business inefficiency associate with the practice of give out of country manager onerous portfolio,negative
794,the evaluation therefore conclude that there be currently insufficient datum to enable the impact of ilo tc to be evaluate,negative
795,the reliance on second phase funding be observe to face increase challenge since traditional donor fun- ding be decline in many country,negative
796,coordination activity by yep to support internal coherence and complementarity have be hinder by -PRON- limited empowerment and lack of dedicated human resource,negative
797,however the evaluation find some bottleneck link to the public private partnership ppp approach be implement in the america and mismatch between youth employment as a priority and regional capacity for support -PRON- in africa,negative
798,the degree of youth employment coordination among various ministry government agency and the social partner have be report as generally low for many of the country where the ilo be work on youth employment,negative
799,as some evaluation case study indicate more work have to be do to generate among ilo partner an integrate approach specifically focus on youth employment,negative
800,the approach adopt appear to be an application of the overall ilo initiative on employment generation rather than on an integrated vision and methodology specifically address youth although the ilo -PRON- have develop approach that respond to the specific need of young people such as the life cycle approach and other policy tool,negative
801,however the cross cuting nature of youth employment require integrate and innovative approach base on shared knowledge a high level of internal communication and organizational resource to provide integration,negative
802,the multi faceted character of intervention require multi disciplinary approach and this be why youth employment initiative be normally multi departmental,negative
803,there be a number of area where coordination could be strengthen,negative
804,as already mention current coordination between headquarters and the field mostly involve staff attach to the employment sector,negative
805,however many of these country still face capacity gap in i develop youth employment policy and programme ii identify the main institutional problem and need iii devise strategy and iv allocate appropriate human and financial resource,negative
806,in many country government have not take the necessary step to address the magnitude of the youth employment challenge,negative
807,as the lead technical un agency the ilo will have to develop not only the expertise but also the organizational and management system to reduce the high transaction cost associate with multi agency process,negative
808,the integrated multi agency and multi sector approach that have evolve for youth employment have prove challenge for the office to manage give the high transaction cost associate with the new planning decision making and implementation process for joint programming and the rapid increase in the number of joint programme which the ilo be call upon to technically support,negative
809,on the negative side the number of ilo project that include gender equality in outcome output and activity have decrease over the action plan period,negative
810,d as a branch require more resource to be able to fully implement the plethora of demand place on -PRON- from ilo staff and constituent,negative
811,some type of gender analysis framework be require across the ilo,negative
812,an action plan must be accompany by other measure such as a strong focus on attitude change within an institution a capacity amongst staff to be able to choose the appropriate response in a give situation and perhaps incentive structure reward and sanction,negative
813,ilo probably require an update vision on gender equality outline where the ilo be go with gender equality and what be expect and why,negative
814,the 2016 17 p&b lack of an outcome on gender equality and non discrimination which many ilo staff be anxious about,negative
815,because no specific funding be allocate for the action plan the evaluation could not conclude on efficiency of resource use,negative
816,gap that remain to be address in the next action plan include link to the sdgs adopt a broad empowerment approach and a well focus on rural woman particularly with two out of ten ilo p&b outcome both very much link to rural area,negative
817,an action plan must be accompany by other measure such as a strong focus on attitude change within an institution a capacity amongst staff to be able to choose the appropriate response in a give situation and perhaps incentive structure reward and sanction,negative
818,nearly three quarter of project be classify with no or only few objective outcome output or activity to promote gender equality,negative
819,the formulation of gender equality and non discrimination marker for the 2016 17 p&b be important and require in house collaboration as well as a review of good practice from other un agency,negative
820,amongst many constituent gender equality issue be not often raise as a priority so -PRON- can be difficult for a typical ilo technical specialist to put the issue on the agenda particularly in patriarchal institution and society,negative
821,-PRON- be difficult to assess the extent the ilo action plan have be an effective instrument to help ensure gender be integrate across each of the four ilo strategic objective because reporting be mainly limit to how important gender equality be for a particular outcome or output without an emphasis on the impact,negative
822,however in most of these case -PRON- appear to be more specific to the post crisis context or base on a bottom up approach involve intervention tailor to the local context and to the local need in order to promote local economic development and the empowerment of local community,negative
823,however give that in opera- tional term ilo be not a humanitarian agency -PRON- have often play a secondary role in the humanitarian field,negative
824,however some of the main challenge include issue relate to ineffective project management the lack of skilled staff and understaffing insufficient funding and other funding issue a lack of recognition of the time need to generate result and finally insufficient commitment of key actor such as stakeholder or beneficiary,negative
825,this mean that the dwcp be not readily evaluable in part because of the nature and definition of outcome and in part because of the difficulty in gain sound evidence link dwcp activity to outcome,negative
826,the general view be that resource mobilisation need to be consider much early in dwcp development i.e. at the dwcp design stage,negative
827,in some country there be a strong call for the use of local language particularly for documentation to enable well participation and transparency,negative
828,underlie concern include the role of rating -PRON- interpretation the perspective(s -PRON- represent the coherence between -PRON- the availability of performance datum and limitation in aggregate rating,negative
829,the main focus on decent work issue be in assess the contribution of dwcp initiative to the outcome,negative
830,this would help not only to ensure that the underlying structural issue be take into account prior to the review be undertake but also that desirable process be follow which appropriately engage the stakeholder at country level,negative
831,overall the cpr encounter a range of structural problem that impact on the dwcps and make -PRON- difficult for the review team to review the cprs effectively,negative
832,the dwcp may not have be ratify and adopt by the government or may have be affect by change political will,negative
833,deficiency in the design and monitoring and evaluation framework for the dwcp mean -PRON- be difficult to assess how well individual initiative be contribute to dwcp outcome and result base management rbm,negative
834,in term of management the cpr seem to be a one off snapshot rather than an ongoing monitoring and review process lead by country authority,negative
835,there be little control over the resource need to implement the dwcp strategy,negative
836,the ilo need to operate as a broker in resource mobilisation,negative
837,problem in communication affect knowledge and ownership of the dwcps the ability to work together and the understanding of the dwcps beyond a limited range of stakeholder,negative
838,to enhance the cpr process -PRON- be recommend that the review be tailor to the specific need of each dwcp and country use a principle base approach rather than adopt a standard formula and assessment criterion see appendix 5,negative
839,risk management strategy also need to be give more attention as part of the dwcp design process give the structural issue encounter and -PRON- potential impact on the viability of the dwcp,negative
840,the perceive lack of time for engage constituent be a common issue affect both review and evaluation but may have have a more significant effect on the cprs give the more participatory approach require,negative
841,in the field some constituent say -PRON- need more involvement during the entire design and implementation of policy and programme not just at the beginning of the process,negative
842,at the same time the review of implementation report suggest that such project be not usual and that project involve entrepreneurship training be far more common,negative
843,more could be do to ensure that gender consideration be include throughout project delivery,negative
844,the fact that youth employment work be disperse throughout the ilo make this kind of analysis even more problematic,negative
845,de- mand for guidance and service from headquarter hq at the country level still exceed supply,negative
846,the evaluation find that a well balance between supply side and demand side drive initiative be need,negative
847,this be in contrast to the area where -PRON- believe the least difference be make youth right at work,negative
848,this involve achievement that be beyond the control of the ilo start up time that be systematically underestimate the challenge of overcome institutional inertia and general unwarranted optimism that everything go accord to plan,negative
849,a single technical cooperation objective would however force those develop the intervention to carefully match component in a more tightly integrate scheme,negative
850,yet poverty be not specifically discuss and consequently project occasionally lose track of the ultimate impact that address poverty condition should have,negative
851,however there be still some way to go before initiative address gender as a force for change in development,negative
852,whether or not the degree of achievement be commensurate with the need and ambition of the project let alone the resource allocate to the initiative be a separate matter,negative
853,too few programme establish baseline to measure progress,negative
854,nevertheless little be say in evaluation report about how -PRON- be function,negative
855,technical cooperation design have emerge as one of the major shortcoming identify with evaluation frequently point to overambitious objective unrealistic time frame and inadequate resource,negative
856,the management of technical cooperation activity be generally a challenge,negative
857,activity be not solely locate within migrant and do not always relate to outcome 7 more migrant worker be protect and more migrant worker have access to productive employment and decent work,negative
858,not all migration project and other activity be label as such and the current programme and budget indicator and target with -PRON- focus on individual country instead of bilateral regional or inter regional approach be also not helpful in this context,negative
859,structurally this place migrant close to work on labour market institution,negative
860,human resource constraint appear as a key reason for any loss of momentum in recent year,negative
861,however the 2008 evaluation also call for increase internal coordination and coherence to do justice to the cross cut nature of labour migration and despite effort to mainstream labour migration across the office in this area the ilo still lack a clear strategy and a well function reporting system,negative
862,nonetheless next to the multilateral framework an additional supplementary companion would be useful in order to provide continued update of good practice example of practical implementation and more specific insight into area not currently cover in depth by the ilo multilateral framework on labour migration,negative
863,as highlight in a number of evaluation for example in africa the americas and the caucasus region obstacle and barrier be particularly strong in area which have experience civil strife or faced transition to democracy,negative
864,the need to have long term commitment and a more incremental approach to achieve positive outcome and sustainability be recommend in many report relate to capacity building and sound industrial relation include non ilo intervention such as in the eu particularly in country where social dialogue and tripartism be face substantial barrier,negative
865,the subsequent recommendation stress the need to strengthen capability in area such as labour law and labour administration,negative
866,social dialogue capacity and sound industrial relation be important external factor often hinder positive outcome,negative
867,there be also obstacle specific to certain type of intervention,negative
868,although the evaluation raise these issue -PRON- do not resolve -PRON-,negative
869,the integration of social finance as a natural ingredient in employment promotion and social protection in the decent work country programme be uneven although improvement have be note towards the end of the period,negative
870,in general quantitative success indicator and quality control measure for social finance be few in the design of tc project intervention especially where sf be one cross cut tool among other and any attention to the assessment of impact rarely exist in the document,negative
871,risks external factor that can disturb or destroy an intervention be often not consider or if -PRON- be then in overly optimistic way,negative
872,most of the work be with individual organisation rather than with national association,negative
873,however both project be too recent for tangible outcome to be expect within the time frame of this evaluation,negative
874,case be note where investment be lose due to delay,negative
875,the sfp have a special responsibility to deal with the apparent limited knowledge of sf in many tc project and country office as well as perception by some that social finance be a headquarters project,negative
876,this reflect the knowledge and understanding of social finance at the field level which be still too dependent on the professional background and interest of individual ilo staff member,negative
877,ilo remain a minor player on the vast international microfinance scene,negative
878,the lack of attention in the project design the relatively short duration and the slow implementation of many sf intervention be threat to sustainability,negative
879,the inefficiency find be mostly link to impractical timeframe and inadequate resource available for achieve the project objective specify which in turn reflect over ambitious project design,negative
880,the weak performance be record in monitoring and evaluation m&e practice primarily due to unsatisfactory specification of outcome level result and inadequate use of associate indicator baseline and subsequent measurement datum for monitoring impact,negative
881,constituent ownership of the result be also find to be only partly successful,negative
882,evidence of risk be effectively manage be find to be highly variable,negative
883,this be largely due to a lack of performance information on such outcome be yet available for the dwcp evaluator to make such assessment for these evaluation,negative
884,-PRON- be a challenging task to move beyond assess the achievement of individual project to assess the achievement in term of dwcp outcome,negative
885,thus -PRON- have be a considerable and ongoing adjustment process to develop a more focused and coherent decent work programme target the need of the country concern which be own by the constituent,negative
886,while the conceptual shift to a dwcp approach be progress -PRON- generally move ahead of the organizational and institutional arrangement need to support -PRON- implementation and the achievement of -PRON- objective,negative
887,such framework be generally find to be inadequate to effectively evaluate the dwcps,negative
888,as such -PRON- be still to be see if there be any success in sustainably build capacity within national stakeholder for market facilitation through the limited set of capacity building activity that be do,negative
889,-PRON- will be more impactful for the lab to focus on -PRON- key objective of knowledge generation and adopt a collaborative approach to mainstreame this approach within and outside the ilo,negative
890,there have be vary level of investment and success in the three key objective,negative
891,the use of annual progress and final report to the donor and programme implementation report do not allow for critical and comprehensive analysis of result achieve nor the identification of opportunity and challenge,negative
892,bidding regulation in the eu do not encourage hire extra ilo project staff in country office nor do -PRON- allow for flexibility during implementation,negative
893,many of the challenge relate to a lack of dedicated staff to this project coordinate across unit at headquarters as well as budget and co financing requirement,negative
894,the gap mdw project do not have an objective to focus adequately on mdws -PRON- although -PRON- strove to reach mdws through partner encourage trade union to represent this category of worker with idwf reach out through -PRON- electronic platform,negative
895,project management challenge relate the complexity of commission multi country study handle 5 migration corridor with multiple site and organization that be intend to generate information towards concrete legislative change in each corridor as well as for global action and advocacy to protect mdws,negative
896,this be lack in the gap mdw project,negative
897,however ensure that w4y be relevant as a discernible input into policy programme or dialogue prove to be very challenging,negative
898,however this be not the case for all the search result and use of the underlying datum generate by the project could increase with more investment in dissemination and communication,negative
899,while ilo and mcf have utilize and disseminate swts information there have to date be limit use of the swts microdata swts report and the youthpol database among global stakeholder,negative
900,this be specifically mention in togo and malawi but the concern about the country report relevance and process for promote buy in at the country level be identify in the mid- term evaluation,negative
901,-PRON- be at the country level that the ambiguity in define the project objective make assess effectiveness more difficult,negative
902,from a value for money perspective only a portion of the potential value of the project have be realize as of yet,negative
903,without the additional investment to support the kind of action describe above project impact at the global level will diminish as the information become less timely and further development and dissemination of the methodology end,negative
904,despite significant investment in face to face engagement in build initial support for the swts survey in many of the country a limit factor in country level impact be the lack of involvement of country partner in the analysis,negative
905,aside from research good practice lesson learn and tool still need to be exchange at a much high rate to inform hiv in the world of work in different country and setting,negative
906,although gender issue have be identify in the code of practice recommendation 200 and other ilo document the ilo strategy on gender and hiv in the world of work be still not very strong,negative
907,national strategy to address hiv and aids in many case country remain concentrated on health sector with prevention and the wide social protection system receive less attention,negative
908,despite the fact that the ilo have develop very interesting good practice on hiv in the context of the informal economy worker a great deal more effort be need to reach the very large number of informal economy worker job seeker and other among poor and vulnerable worker,negative
909,at country level development partner work on hiv often be not very familiar with the ilo‘s tripartite process and -PRON- work with ministry of labour although there be an increase recognition of the need to integrate and associate multiple partner,negative
910,however some ilo program manager involve in implementation think the global level intervention strategy would have be more effective if -PRON- be more focused with few strategic output,negative
911,however several research product and training tool be not yet finalize or diffuse by the end of the project implementation period,negative
912,the capacity of the fundamental branch to follow up and complete these deliverable be challenge by staff reduction and strategic reorientation and threaten -PRON- sustainability,negative
913,in some case the project design envisage need assessment and gap analysis that be not finally develop,negative
914,this have problematize project tracking from headquarters the eventual communication of information between the office and country that form part of the project and the availability of datum that be disaggregate by gender,negative
915,the fact that the country cover by the project be from many different region have make -PRON- difficult to encourage south south cooperative activity,negative
916,the project have not have a monitoring system,negative
917,a knowledge transfer strategy should also be systematize formalize and monitor by the project,negative
918,at ilo headquarters hq and in the three country visit interest to reinforce intra- interagency and interinstitutional cooperation as well as coordination have be express,negative
919,despite the dedication of ilo hq and country project team to keep up with tight deadline the project have face strong delay and require continuous strong and proactive dedication of all administrative support staff to reach expect result,negative
920,no knowledge transfer strategy have yet be define by the project,negative
921,assess the likelihood of sustainability of result at the country level be tricky at this stage,negative
922,monitoring tool and process have not be sufficiently tailor to the need of project implementer,negative
923,in other country work on force labour need more follow up with the national government to have significant impact on policy or implement mechanism,negative
924,however the less detailed reporting requirement by the donor associate with outcome base funding do also mean that report against the log frame indicator have not be systematically compile at the country level which could present problem for institutional memory,negative
925,these factor affect action and decision making and direct effort away from a more operational and strategic implementation,negative
926,the division of duty in project management between cepol and yep result in diluted and unclear management coordination and reporting responsibility,negative
927,the organizational and system level of capacity development receive less attention,negative
928,the rating in the assessment below reflect identify performance level with the caveat that lack of consistent datum lower rating for certain criterion,negative
929,there be no assign custodian in the ilo to coordinate capacity development for government agency in term of policy development knowledge management implementation support guidance and supervision,negative
930,however report on ag- gregate result mask a wide range of activity for different purpose and convey little concern the relevance realism and the quality and performance of capacity development in a country context system level,negative
931,there be limited monitoring and evalua- tion of the outcome and impact associate with capacity development so -PRON- be not always easy to see if personal development have contribute to organizational development or if the newly acquire skill and knowledge will be sustain once the individual have leave,negative
932,while there be great recognition of the role of dw in poverty reduction well elaboration of the link between the two be need,negative
933,the ilo have undertake initiative in line with the need to develop measurement indicator for dw although a well assessment of the exist statistical capacity of each of the country would have be useful,negative
934,while there be positive example ilo imf cooperation well coherence be need in the measurement of dw,negative
935,however to some extent the lack of internal coherence within the ilo pose a risk to the effectiveness of this initiative especially because of the multiple assessments3 in place concurrently,negative
936,capacity building be find to be less effective if the enable environment be lack,negative
937,however the effectiveness of -PRON- application have remain low,negative
938,so far system for learn across organization do not sufficiently support the sharing of knowledge and experience on the mainstreaming of dw,negative
939,vertical coherence between activity at hq and at ro and co level have be mix,negative
940,horizontal coherence between the component of the outcome strategy in a give country also could be improve through the dwcps,negative
941,at the national level the unjustifiably short duration of the project in relation to the define outcome couple with delay in approval launch and transaction be reduce the efficient use of the time available,negative
942,ilo visibility be rather low in some country ultimately hinder the mainstreaming of dw which be largely due to the lack of a wide communication strategy,negative
943,low national ownership and funding in some country lack of the necessary expertise lack of clarity relate to ilo commitment to continued support and inadequate horizontal coherence within the ilo be find to be key limitation to sustainability,negative
944,-PRON- also do not provide guidance on promote cross fertilization and collaboration with other outcome,negative
945,this can hamper the potential of the outcome- base work planning obw approach towards more coherent programme planning implementation and reporting,negative
946,regard the relevance of the ilo strategy the team find that while the strategy under outcome 17 provide a global sense of direction for the implementation of non discrimination work -PRON- be not explicitly link to the high level strategic guidance lay out in the grs aps and the gjp,negative
947,the employment intensive construction method be disadvantage by long hold national and international concern about the management intensity for government institution and -PRON- contractor and perceive risk link to the relatively slow disbursement of fund,negative
948,the ilo have the mandate and expertise to carry out the objective of the programme but lack the full leverage to bring about the policy institutional and philosophical change need without more support from key influential institution at global regional and national level,negative
949,there be wide disparity in the number of country cover by each regional office ro decent work technical support team dwt and by each country office co as well as in the office architecture,negative
950,the inequity be great for africa and the arab state,negative
951,more generally issue emanate from resource constraint have slow the pace of reform,negative
952,the extent to which programme and budget proposal be base on an assessment of need be not clear as budget only marginally change from one biennium to the next,negative
953,more flexibility in financial and human resource management be need for decentralization effort to lead to decision at the field level,negative
954,there do not appear to be a systematic process for determine demand at country or regional level although the process of develop dwcps partly serve this purpose,negative
955,this be a major factor in determine whether or not the ilo be an effective partner in all unct,negative
956,knowledge management and commu- nication system need to be improve in the context of a culture of share to make the work of the fos more effective,negative
957,such move have not always be sufficiently gender responsive in address the gender gap at various level,negative
958,programme support income psi funding to support the fos and as an incentive for resource mobilization remain centra- lize in allocation,negative
959,although a staff mobility procedure be in place there be minimal evidence of staff movement in practice although some difference and variation between region and department be observe,negative
960,provision of technical support appear to be drive more by supply than demand include where donor resource be available,negative
961,in the field there be low awareness of the reform effort despite high interest with the pace of reform generally perceive to be slow,negative
962,evidence suggest that the ilo be less effective in country lack a resident designate ilo official,negative
963,-PRON- be still mostly a one way connection between hq and the field,negative
964,this be in part explain by the fact that the implementation of the mcof at these level do not always imply additional allocation of resource,negative
965,the exclusion of some project in post crisis situation which focus on technical assistance for migration management be problematic as this be contrary to the spirit of the facility,negative
966,the report note however that with the expansion of the facility the number of project to review comment on and submit to the iom director general for approval have be increase,negative
967,one member state also propose that the criterion and guideline be review in the light of the outcome of the current iom budget reform process,negative
968,the concrete benefit of use a tot as a means of expand role out to ensure the replication and monitoring be recognise in particular in the philippines and would require further effort in indonesia,negative
969,further funding for coordination and priority setting in the destination country of italy and the netherlands could have be beneficial,negative
970,further inclusion of other project stakeholder such as formal partner or associate could also have increase the capacity development in the medium term of government civil society diaspora group and other main actor,negative
971,such outreach could have ensure more systematic access to exist material and expert input,negative
972,the benefit to the direct beneficiary i.e. migrant would have have the most relevance to objective 4 improve remittance transfer service and provide remittance transfer through formal financial institution,negative
973,the government counterpart as well as key iom implement mission have be absent from the steering committee meeting,negative
974,network and dialoguing have mainly limit to protect partner and could have benefit from a more systematic external communication strategy,negative
975,bilateral dialogue mechanism between s. e asia and the eu be likely to be sustain over the long term but be likely to require further resource and prioritization,negative
976,however as the mcof be a tool for foster improved internal coordination and programmatic coherence at all level a strengthening of the internal coordination mechanism and the allocation of resource on a consistent and ongoing basis be require for undertake comprehensive assessment and develop response strategy at different stage of a crisis with mobility dimension include in anticipation of or in the wake of a crisis situation,negative
977,externally one of the barrier to use the mcof be the existence of other strategy and system such as the humanitarian country team hct coordination system and the cluster approach,negative
978,an identified weakness be the imbalance between promotional activity in italy and in the select country of origin which do not aid promotion of the mida concept in those country already affect by low institutional commitment,negative
979,the project document and implementation however entirely lack gender focus which should be rectify in the extension phase under discussion and other future mida project,negative
980,the project be not effective in transfer skill and capacity building activity as no transfer take place contrary to initial plan,negative
981,no investment project be implement,negative
982,however the result in term of contribution to development be weak and the overall approach require further analysis,negative
983,the report note that measure some of those impact be not cost effective require time and high investment and that work on the effectiveness with verified hypothesis such as that brain drain affect development can be as informative and relevant,negative
984,however -PRON- sustainability prospect remain entirely donor drive,negative
985,the project come to the end of -PRON- cycle and in case the time extension be not grant the project result will not be fully reach as the capacity building and technical expertise essential for the running of the centre will not be available any long,negative
986,apart from neighbourhood opposition the municipal and national election and the referendum a difficult economic situation in the country additionally prolong the efficient open centre set up,negative
987,at headquart level the private sector liaison team in the donor relations department drd remain small with the head also have other donor liaison function,negative
988,there be nonetheless key factor that need to be address to achieve the strategy such as increase human resource finetune institutional process or improve the understanding of how to engage with private sector,negative
989,there be no mechanism to raise funding regularly through exist private sector contributor such as use a percentage of the private sector funding to reinvest into implement the strategy,negative
990,there be however other effort such as knowledge management which be not implement due mostly to lack of human and financial resource put sustainability effort at risk,negative
991,at the regional level private sector engagement vary accord to opportunity the capacity and resource to implement -PRON- and actively seek partnership,negative
992,the reason give for a negative rating be mainly the limited fund and therefore action absence of government response and interest and regional dispersal affecting implementation,negative
993,other iom office consider that 15 per cent of the project survey do not achieve the expect outcome or impact the main reason be disagreement among benefit government on project implementation or follow up action and poor project design,negative
994,as highlight in the survey conduct some iom office assign the duty over child orient protection and assistance to iom project manager pms and in certain case the child protection issue be handle by staff who do not possess the relevant expertise on the topic,negative
995,survey result also show that regular training of staff involve in child protection along with the mapping of child orient project to capture relevant information good practice and lesson learn be miss,negative
996,dmm and doe manager note however that responsibility over the management of migrant child assistance be not always clearly draw between the department sharing of information can be improve and the challenge in programme implementation be increase with the lack of a comprehensive institutional policy,negative
997,continuous gender mainstreame training and building of capacity be need on how to effectively assist specific gender group along with the exchange of good practice in the frame of gender sensitive project development and implementation and gender responsive budgeting and reporting,negative
998,however financial constraint limit such a close monitoring of victim which range from none at the end of the project to a period of six to nine month,negative
999,monitor challenge remain in case of the assistance provide to child victim of trafficking,negative
1000,iom faced challenge in implement the employment component either due to structural constraint such as the registration process for access social assistance scheme after termination of employment or ensure that the worker from the municipal employment centre mec be be effectively employ during the infrastructure project,negative
1001,this disjointedness have increase the risk of duplication which need to be address move forward as this result in a waste of money time and human resource and can create confusion when -PRON- come to storing share and manage knowledge in the organization,negative
1002,survey respondent and interviewee be also split on the issue of the extent that exist iom policy and strategy facilitate knowledge management and -PRON- institutionalization in the organization,negative
1003,as most knowledge management effort that have be implement thus far in iom have not be fund through any specific fund allocate to knowledge management very few respondent be able to discuss -PRON- cost effectiveness and sustainability,negative
1004,no 12 be also await since november 2017 due to the donor consider new funding and an extension until the end of 2018 allow the implementation of additional activity,negative
1005,one finding be that the indicator of the project be different from those in the cccm strategy and -PRON- could have be well streamline,negative
1006,some aspect of coordination such as share more information on each of the component could have be improve in order to streamline the activity and identify lesson learn that could be relevant for the cluster as a whole,negative
1007,base on the input from global team member the evaluation recommend to well define selection criterion to maximize the benefit and prioritize deployment,negative
1008,cccm should capitalize on -PRON- current effort with cp partner to ensure that during evacuation displacement be well manage,negative
1009,whilst match civil protection with cccm expertise have prove challenge at time civil protection have be identify as integral to humanitarian assistance,negative
1010,however as dtm activity continue to expand -PRON- be important that appropriate human resource be in place to match the expansion of activity,negative
1011,however exist dtm m&e mechanism require important attention to effectively report on the dtm activity include recommendation for future strategic move such as the development and coordination of dtm activity in the field and secure donor funding,negative
1012,externally the promotion and advertisement of the dtm among partner government donor and other key stakeholder be do on an ad hoc basis which could be strengthen through the clarification of the dtm objective and the development of a strategy for dtm,negative
1013,yet more effort be require to ensure dtm activity be implement in a timely manner,negative
1014,the challenge now be to maintain this momentum along with the grow interest in the dtm,negative
1015,some member state suggest that more information could be include in the annual report on the different crisis for which mefm be activate and on the status of reimbursement,negative
1016,the mechanism benefit from contribution from 12 member state which total usd 11.2 million represent only 38 per cent of the target,negative
1017,nonetheless the remain balance as at 31 december 2015 be low due to the difficulty in obtain reimbursement,negative
1018,moreover if this aspect of the mechanism do not function more effectively the operational balance will soon be render ineffective,negative
1019,one of the main reason for the difficulty in obtain reimbursement be the lack of interest of iom donor in reimburse amount use for evacuation which represent 71 per cent of the fund to be repay as at 31 december 2015,negative
1020,the area which require some improvement be those related to the implementation of the community plan and ensure that proper responsibility and monitoring be conduct to track the plan,negative
1021,these change be not however include in the result framework for the project,negative
1022,similarly within the mgi limited question relate to gender have be incorporate,negative
1023,not include migration in the early stage raise the risk of not be include at all,negative
1024,gender disaggregate information be not thus far be capture in all relate indicator that be be define for the sdg and end process,negative
1025,still these achievement fall below the average number of indicator 11 meet by other un fund and programme entities.1,negative
1026,training do not reach enough people,negative
1027,this be particularly noticeable in find clear distinction between gender relate activity and counter traffic activity focus mainly on woman,negative
1028,implementation of internal information campaign in such country could for instance encourage female g staff to apply more frequently for p position or male g staff to encourage -PRON- countrywoman to apply for iom post in support of the official policy of a gender balance staffing structure,negative
1029,the work do by iom staff for mainstreaming gender should be well recognize in particular for those contribute regularly to -PRON- implementation,negative
1030,regard programme the evaluation observe some confusion on what fall specifically under gender what can be consider as gender sensitive and what be not target gender relate problem,negative
1031,the result also do not capture change that may have take place beyond the environment sector or among multiple sector,negative
1032,however -PRON- should be note that for some pim project especially those that do not have sub project the state result show a close alignment to the expect accomplishment,negative
1033,substantive change that may take place across multiple sector of a country or change in the global discourse appear difficult to track and therefore be not report,negative
1034,the further breakdown and single counting still do not allow for insight into the scale of the adoption of change or the implementation of agree action,negative
1035,however more clarity around the operationalisation of this policy would be beneficial,negative
1036,a connected issue be the tension between the normative role un environment programme as a whole be design to play and the operational role -PRON- have in practice,negative
1037,financial and institutional sustainability at a project level be similarly limited and often dependant on follow up funding,negative
1038,be mostly externally fund the focus on fund acquisition foster diversification but can hinder integration,negative
1039,this criterion include consideration of partner and stakeholder engagement in the period between project approval and mobilisation,negative
1040,some of this be due to lengthy commenting process and the need for extensive reworking of element like theory of change and logical framework,negative
1041,as a result the project enter into the project information management system often do not entirely match the work deliver or be deliver via multiple often separate donor- funded project,negative
1042,understanding and acceptance of the need for the monitoring of project implementation i.e. track progress against an agree plan to inform adaptive management be weak and have an effect on efficiency through the need for project extension,negative
1043,however external communication with partner and audience be still well develop and plan than the internal communication that be often ad hoc and fragment,negative
1044,however the description use in both the sub- programme theory of change and the outcome map could be well align with these global goal,negative
1045,the limitation outline above contribute to the project information management system be inadequate for gather the require datum thus data be extract from various other source on a bi annual basis make -PRON- a manual and time consume process with high transaction cost for the organisation,negative
1046,the actual impact of the sub programme on change in the recipient country and organisation however be hard to gauge since the change that be report show a limited and superficial picture of the deep change that possibly take place in the country business actor city and consumer group,negative
1047,the strategic sustainability of the sub programme be reduce by the strong dependency on external funding which increase donor influence and reduce the possibility for strategic focus and integration of project,negative
1048,although -PRON- be a relatively new system the umoja administrative and financial system be report to be cumbersome in use not user friendly and not set up yet to donor reporting requirement,negative
1049,however a number of activity be cancel or scale back as a result of funding shortfall or late receipt of funding and in retrospect the pow can be see to have be overambitious with regard to available resource,negative
1050,however great attention need to be pay to the driver of high level outcome and sustainability include notably to increase visibility and awareness of the map initiative as a basis for political will and country ownership,negative
1051,the latter affected planning and delivery of activity effectively truncate the delivery period in each biennia,negative
1052,failure to increase ordinary contribution will continue to compromise the effectiveness of pow delivery include as a result of shortfall in staffing,negative
1053,the first be the question of prioritisation of activity as a means to limit the effect of funding shortfall on pow delivery,negative
1054,there be no outcome indicator in the pow logframe,negative
1055,mechanism for gender mainstreaming have be put in place in some of the core area of unep work but these be not yet robust enough to ensure compliance and a meaningful integration of gender perspective into operational or programmatic area of work,negative
1056,ensure gender sensitivity of institutional process alone do not guarantee the improvement of the quality of life of the disadvantaged or most vulnerable group of people,negative
1057,the context be unclear there be no statement as to how gender equality and equity should be understand in unep and how -PRON- apply to unep work,negative
1058,the review find that the gender mainstreaming strategy and -PRON- accountability and result framework be not well understand by unep staff mainly due to inadequate awareness raising and capacity building of staff for gender mainstreaming,negative
1059,more than a third 38 be not aware -PRON- exist as reflect in the gender perception survey,negative
1060,the gepa be not result base and the gender mainstreaming action be not link to specific expected outcome or result and to the operational priority of unep,negative
1061,the review do not find sufficient evidence of proactive effort from management to mobilize or allocate adequate fund for gender mainstreaming effort,negative
1062,with the current unep funding mechanism for operation which be tie up to sub programme the prospect for specific funding for gender be bleak unless specific allocation will be provide to cross cutting issue include gender,negative
1063,there be only a minimal gender unit compose of just one senior gender advisor sga locate in the quality assurance section qas office of operation,negative
1064,hence many gfp be inactive,negative
1065,by focus gender mainstreaming mainly on institutional process the gepa do not fully support the gender equality objective set in the gc decision,negative
1066,in the few document that feature gender the focus be generally minimal,negative
1067,unep will always have difficulty in report on gender as long as -PRON- do not cover gender specific issue or systematically use sex disaggregate datum,negative
1068,but increase the proportion of female staff in p5 and d1 level remain a challenge,negative
1069,consequently there have be miss opportunity for gender to be reflect in some key publication,negative
1070,but -PRON- be spread out without a mechanism to effectively consolidate and share and therefore not easily accessible to unep staff,negative
1071,the gepa have not consistently indicate expect outcome and output of these partnership,negative
1072,but unep be have difficulty in successfully demonstrate -PRON- contribution to this endeavour,negative
1073,the main reason for this deficiency be inadequate policy review mechanism and limited engagement of the sga in the policy development process,negative
1074,despite effort from the sga in collaboration with sub programme coordinator the thematic gender action plan be not widely know by all member of the gender focal team in the division and regional office,negative
1075,unep also need to pay more attention to support career enhancement and life and work balance of staff include focus career enhancement training for woman enhance induction package and referral system provide by unon and improve the mechanism for implementation of harassment policy,negative
1076,the veracity of those finding remain undiminished,negative
1077,sub programme coordinator work across the divisional structure but do not hold any authority over human or financial resource,negative
1078,many staff involve in pow preparation include subprogramme coordinator do not play any active role in the preparation of the mts,negative
1079,furthermore there be no clear link between pow output target and ea target,negative
1080,to add to the confusion in some case related pow output be actually consecutive step in a result chain with one expect to lead to the other,negative
1081,this lack of authority can impede spc from get access to progress information from other division limit -PRON- ability to influence project and programme design process and constrain -PRON- influence on resource allocation decision to pursue alignment with subprogramme priority,negative
1082,similar situation may prevail in relation to resource mobilisation priority,negative
1083,-PRON- would seem that the resource allocation trend associate with the former divisional structure prior to 2010 have be use to guide allocation of the environment fund,negative
1084,qas do provide project document template and useful feedback on draft project design document,negative
1085,in a few case milestone refer to external event which would have happen anyway,negative
1086,-PRON- do seem that many project have largely be design within division,negative
1087,in addition a large proportion of pow output be define at outcome level therefore there be temporal problem in use these indicator to monitor progress in programme implementation,negative
1088,a lack of detail in project document on stakeholder often go hand in hand with poorly articulate outreach and dissemination strategy,negative
1089,gender aspect rarely feature in performance indicator or monitoring plan,negative
1090,at the time of project approval a significant number of project have mobilize none or very small proportion of the require project fund,negative
1091,replication of project result be most often expect to happen simply through communication and awareness raising website policy brief lesson learn paper etc,negative
1092,most project design lack adequate baseline and very few specify activity to establish baseline and conduct recurrent monitoring,negative
1093,-PRON- appear to have frequently be overlook in the discrete project design process that take place in the division,negative
1094,the simultaneous introduction of result orient programming to the development of thematic subprogramme that cut across the divisional structure of the organisation add considerable complexity to work planning process,negative
1095,spc report to the director of -PRON- respective lead division,negative
1096,project be design under sub optimal condition,negative
1097,similar to the finding above synergy among multiple project contribute to one ea or pow output be not adequately describe,negative
1098,the narrative description and logframe present in the project document frequently make no mention of the activity that be list as csfs,negative
1099,approve pow project lack adequate detail on the strategy to be employ to sustain project outcome,negative
1100,analysis of stakeholder need and how -PRON- may be affect by or contribute to the project be often weak or absent,negative
1101,how the private sector will be engage often remain unclear,negative
1102,however the evaluation find that in comparison to some other un agency unep struggle to fully embrace operate under one un at the country level,negative
1103,regional office and regional collaborative effort be chronically under resource and a lack of country presence exacerbate communication and increase transaction cost lead to frequent administrative delay,negative
1104,there do not appear to be a clear approach on engagement with particular country nor a coherent strategy for identify potential new partner country nor a great attention for possible synergy at the regional level,negative
1105,this be mostly true for intervention mean to test and demonstrate approach as part of large regional or global programme,negative
1106,however many partner country interviewee be not aware which knowledge product and tool be develop specifically with the support of unep,negative
1107,already on go and pre existing project and program strongly shape current intervention but in many case the sustainability lesson draw from these intervention be not explicitly state and bring forward into current activity,negative
1108,interviewee both across unep staff and in country stakeholder have voice concern over the lack of resource devote to communication dissemination translation of report memo and publication into local language to help ensure the material reach intended audience,negative
1109,in addition project miss opportunity to reorient and well focus on achieve intend change by not regularly incorporate assumption and driver into planning and implementation,negative
1110,however stakeholder involvement especially at the country level could be strong during the design stage of project,negative
1111,-PRON- have also mean work in few country concentrate effort in country where unep have a prove track record or previous relationship and group related project together within those country,negative
1112,this be partly attributable to a lack of fund to design project result in a perpetual pattern of borrowing from exist project to develop new one,negative
1113,driver be also largely absent from project design document,negative
1114,however risk be often poorly formulate and project rarely foresaw a mechanism to monitor risk,negative
1115,accord to qas many project be submit to prc without 6-month milestone and target for each indicator and qas make suggestion for milestone and target which project manager be often expect to take up by the prc,negative
1116,on the whole however stakeholder analysis and capacity assessment in the design stage be often weak and infrequently use to well identify the respective capacity and define potential role of specific direct and indirect intervention partner,negative
1117,umbrella project do not present a theory of change explain the coherence between -PRON- sub project and sub project result be difficult to identify and track for the purpose of learning and accountability,negative
1118,in order to support the geographically disperse effort when the ccsp be first launch climate change expert be place in each of the regional office,negative
1119,dtie as the lead division make the final budgetary decision,negative
1120,dtie have the responsibility of coordination and allocation of funding for the ccsp but without an accountability mechanism,negative
1121,some team expect to be budget under the ccsp between 2010 13 end up assign with responsibility for only a minimal activity budget,negative
1122,some manager and staff see rbm as an external imposition rather than a management approach that support meet -PRON- key deliverable,negative
1123,the ccsp as a whole be chronically stifle by staff shortage largely due to vacancy that remain open due to the slow recruitment process,negative
1124,unep claim to have insufficient resource to open sub regional office,negative
1125,however the relatively small amount of ef funding can also be unpredictable as ef fund be only gradually release as donor make -PRON- contribution to unep,negative
1126,in some case funding constraint make -PRON- impossible to conduct the plan field demonstration and to provide follow up after train course,negative
1127,project document hardly ever present budget that be break down to the output or activity level,negative
1128,furthermore as more partnership be in demand within unep and the un but also with external partner project team have to devote additional time and energy to maintain those relationship,negative
1129,however despite many good intention present in the pow programme framework document and project document there be little evidence of effective formal collaboration between unep division relate to the ccsp,negative
1130,these project have not be design in a way that would promote collaboration at the national level,negative
1131,work with the un redd programme entail inescapable transaction cost such as the need to operate through three distinct budget line internal procedure and complex decision making,negative
1132,the overall administrative burden in particular the long lead time to get contract out be an area of concern,negative
1133,regional office make effort to follow up on the undaf preparation process but due to limited resource -PRON- can not participate in the undaf preparation of all the country pertain to the region and very often the unep programming cycle do not match with that of the undaf,negative
1134,most of the time indicator be define in the logical framework matrix include in the project document but quite often -PRON- be not smart2 and not monitor regularly in the course of project implementation,negative
1135,publicly available output assessment guideline etc can be find online but information on -PRON- utility and use be non existent,negative
1136,pims be still not consider a user friendly system with few incentive to use -PRON- for management decision making,negative
1137,gef fund project fare much well as gef rule regard reporting and evaluation have be much more strictly apply in unep,negative
1138,the causal chain may be tight and traceable but -PRON- may take several year before policy translate into actual investment in well technology which be when increase resilience or reduction in ghg emission relative to a baseline can be measure with some confidence and degree of accuracy,negative
1139,unep can only provide the good possible product and service target those to the most appropriate people in the most appropriate format,negative
1140,both pim and pprs however seem to have a have a strong positive reporting bias only achievement be report not failure,negative
1141,these step and the result understanding gain be not currently incorporate in project design and represent miss opportunity,negative
1142,overall the global economic and financial downturn have slow down investment decision of financial institution and government towards environmental objective,negative
1143,fluctuation in oil price affect competitiveness of renewable energy solution and diving carbon price have reduce the feasibility of cdm project,negative
1144,unep do not systematically build cost save measure into project design but change circumstance lead to resource constraint sometimes require project team to take cost save measure during implementation,negative
1145,one of the finding of the unep mts evaluation be that the current interpretation of matrix management in unep be not provide the clear line of authority and accountability for programme delivery that be need,negative
1146,though the process of develop the pow every two year and project approval through the project review committee prcs provide regular opportunity to bring together staff from different division there be no regular managerial or administrative tie between sub programme,negative
1147,the financial management system use by unep the un wide integrated management information system imis do not lend -PRON- to straightforward extraction and summarizing of financial information at the sub programme ea or pow output level,negative
1148,while there be multiple opportunity collaboration between the various component of the ccsp be limit so far,negative
1149,at the country level even though some effort be make at the beginning of a new engagement to map all related activity both national and international to examine possible synergy and risk of overlap overall unep support intervention be often fragmented,negative
1150,the establishment of relevant contractual agreement with project partner present constant challenge with regard to unep administrative process,negative
1151,additionally -PRON- be a real challenge to formulate result statement and indicator that would be acceptable for all party often end up in compromise,negative
1152,there be also a sequencing problem in the preparation of the pfs whereby project identification take place before the programme logic theory of change for the sub programme be develop,negative
1153,however because qas provide feedback on early draft of prodocs and clear prodocs before submission to prc there be a risk of bias stem from conflict role,negative
1154,within sub programme there be no prioritization of output or eas,negative
1155,unep intend to provide in the pf document,negative
1156,f document also mention the main target group of the sub programme but -PRON- role or how and why -PRON- would be affect by change promote by the sub programme be not explain,negative
1157,neither do -PRON- articulate sub programme wide role and responsibility of unep division branch and unit,negative
1158,however -PRON- do not propose a credible resource mobilization strategy for -PRON- sub programme,negative
1159,due to special attention by prc recent prodocs identify the regional and country dimension of the project well and provide a clear description of the expected role of regional office but still remain unclear on what and how resource will be channel to the regional office,negative
1160,many critical aspect of project design e.g. stakeholder and partnership analysis sustainability scale up and replication strategy safeguard etc will remain general description and lack accuracy if the location of the project be unknown,negative
1161,at time the gender goal proclaim sound rather unconvincing especially because gender relate activity be usually not to be find in the work plan or the detailed budget of the project,negative
1162,while effort to streamline unep template with donor template have be make -PRON- be not always clear to project developer on what be need for prc in the case of project that be be fund by entity that have -PRON- own template,negative
1163,the evaluation also find that prc comment be not always take on board and verification of the final prodoc at approval could be more rigorous,negative
1164,the final approve pf document have be abridge and be miss much of the content propose in the initial guideline prepare by qas,negative
1165,on the other hand financial sustainability of result which be closely link to up scaling be not explicitly address in pf document though some sub programme foresee specific project to develop financing mechanism which be expect to enhance the financial sustainability and up scaling of result achieve by other project in the sub programme,negative
1166,none of the pf document currently present a gender dimension to the sub programme,negative
1167,project concept in programme framework document often provide insufficient information to judge the strategic merit of the project in the broad strategic context of the sub programme,negative
1168,many project concept do not indicate the country in which the project will be implement,negative
1169,participate country be often unconfirmed and sometimes even unknown which add a considerable amount of uncertainty to the project,negative
1170,the report note however that sound chemical management throughout -PRON- lifecycle be essential to avoid significant risk to human health and environment as well as substantial cost to national economy,negative
1171,c&w indeed there be a perception that the awareness raise effort need to be strengthen to support resource mobilization effort for sub programme implementation,negative
1172,however the key output relate to the gpwm accomplish little,negative
1173,-PRON- be quite clear from interview with staff that considerable pre packaging of old activity to fit the expected accomplishment define in the mts occur,negative
1174,there be lack of effective coordination and collaboration within the branch and this be symptomatic of how -PRON- work generally within unep,negative
1175,for instance in the past eleven year there have be seven different head of the chemical branch with the current chemical branch director set to retire in the course of 2015,negative
1176,the sub- programme have consistently identify the availability of fund to be a constraint in carry out -PRON- capacity building activity,negative
1177,reporting especially at the expect accomplishment level be not base on milestone and do not reflect progress be make by the sub programme towards eas,negative
1178,since 2010 quarterly progress report on project in pim have also be undertake against project milestone,negative
1179,milestone in most of the project seem adequate for measure implementation progress,negative
1180,with little to no baseline information poorly formulate expect accomplishment indicator problem with attribution and the lack of budget for project monitoring the task of monitor accomplishment become a difficult one,negative
1181,even obligatory completion report of a reasonable quality have not be prepared for most complete project,negative
1182,as a result of the lack of fund to operate the information clearinghouse however alternative method be use to disseminate technical and scientific information relate to saicm implementation,negative
1183,lack of adequate resource for the provision of clearinghouse service as well as plan for regional meeting have be a challenge for saicm,negative
1184,as find in other sub programme evaluate in unep the process for recruit procure good and service and managing fund be quite bureaucratic and cumbersome and have cause delay in programme delivery,negative
1185,however about one fifth 19 of the staff be unhappy or very unhappy to come to work and highlight the following as pertinent issue the increase in and emphasis on organizational procedure that limit time to undertake technical work excessive workload and undertake multiple role mainly attribute to understaffing change in leadership and the result different management style over time impact on the sub programme and staff morale ineffective communication within the sub programme and involved unep branch and limited opportunity for promotion or lateral move of staff,negative
1186,the budget shortfall be more evident over the period of the 2010 13 mts with a 67 shortfall,negative
1187,independent evaluative evidence for the project in the c&w sub programme portfolio be very scarce,negative
1188,as highlight in the formative evaluation the expect accomplishment do not provide a fully coherent result framework for the sub programme,negative
1189,this logic run against a key observation well understand within delc and promote to external audience that chaotic proliferation of environmental agreement and institutional arrangement have create obstacle to implementation with among other issue multiple reporting require of country,negative
1190,the visibility of such corporate work both in term of report performance and as a clear locus for resource allocation be also affect,negative
1191,this further undermine result base design principle,negative
1192,for example within the hs hw sub- programme the support to draft an mea on mercury although not formally a part of the egsp be substantively support by -PRON-,negative
1193,as a result project alignment and overall cohesiveness of the egsp portfolio be lack and potential link between project and other sps often remain unexplored,negative
1194,this have be a systemic constraint that be not limit to the egsp,negative
1195,basic management practice such as periodic group meeting internal review work plan revision or forward planning exercise be generally lack at subprogramme level across the divisional divide,negative
1196,a difficulty that be subsequently also experience by the quality assurance section in organizational level monitoring process,negative
1197,assessment of cost- effectiveness at high programmatic level be severely constrain by this,negative
1198,the end result have be a supply side dynamic to budgeting that be largely ad hoc and dependent on the availability of fund for division implement project rather than foster of a share strategic vision well align with sp priority,negative
1199,the current monitoring system remain a self assessment,negative
1200,imdis and pprs be acknowledge to have particular limitation in the amount of information that can be capture in -PRON- which force staff to be selective in choose which activity to include when report,negative
1201,consequently unep staff in the division do not entirely perceive the utility of this reporting for decision making and -PRON- express frustration about the process,negative
1202,the central role of country be part of the unep vision yet -PRON- be not clearly outline and reflect in the unep subprogramme design and implementation arrangement,negative
1203,work that proceed outside the project modality have a number of negative consequence for the systematic tracking of progress reporting of result at project ea and sp level and evaluation of result,negative
1204,-PRON- be difficult to discern the effect if any the subprogramme modality have have on the performance of -PRON- constituent initiative,negative
1205,sub programme management i.e.management process that operate across the subprogramme have be rather disjoint and have struggle to meet the need of an inherently complex sp that have suffer from limited cohesiveness,negative
1206,the lead division sp coordinator and support staff have have limit influence over performance of the entire sub programme and accountability have be unclear,negative
1207,the absence of programme dynamic and unresolved tension with division manage function lower egsp momentum and the motivation of some participant who perceive the subprogramme as a burdensome overlay to core divisional responsibility,negative
1208,the integrated management information system imis do not allow break down of individual staff time among sps,negative
1209,the evaluation could not find any evidence of financial datum allocation and expenditure collect and track at sp or ea level,negative
1210,overall the current reporting system do not fully reflect the work for which unep be accountable and the level of achievement of result because of a number of inter relate factor,negative
1211,there be a need for well integration of environmental consideration in disaster risk reduction drr approach and vice versa and well preparedness for industrial accident,negative
1212,most attention be give to policy and planning skill while assessment management monitoring and enforcement skill have receive less attention,negative
1213,even though the d&c team have learn to a certain extent to cope with insecurity there be definitely a limit to where unep team and -PRON- local partner can continue operate on the ground without put person in danger,negative
1214,security risk often seriously hamper the movement and therefore the effectiveness of field staff,negative
1215,some significant result achieve as regard policy strategy planning and regulatory framework should also contribute to sustainability,negative
1216,-PRON- be hard to see an overall programme logic emerge from the project document except in very broad term,negative
1217,in some way however the problem relate to insufficient human resource be the consequence of a successfully grow programme partly due to the lack of dedicated unep core resource and to some extent relate to management system that be not well suited to become operational at the field level,negative
1218,the depth of partnership as well as distribution of role and responsibility however varie,negative
1219,progress report for individual project be scarce and when -PRON- exist of very variable quality,negative
1220,more junior well train technical staff tend to be more volatile in that -PRON- be often attract by well pay position with international organisation operate in the country,negative
1221,if one or more immediate outcome driver or assumption remain lack -PRON- constitute obstacle or bottleneck and the likelihood of achieve last change in term of environmental management and governance be reduce as be the likelihood of contribute to sustainable recovery of environmental benefit and livelihood,negative
1222,cumbersome administrative regulation and process have cause many delay in programme delivery which sometimes affect the credibility of unep in the eye of partner,negative
1223,there be overall little independent evaluative evidence for the project in the d&c portfolio,negative
1224,consequently there be a risk of overlap and duplication of effort with other organisation include other un agency,negative
1225,there be limited documentation on the selection of or choice between country or how other criterion be apply,negative
1226,rather than address a specific environmental challenge such as climate change harmful substance or disaster and conflict ecosystem management be a means to an end not an end in -PRON-,negative
1227,pprs rating on ea delivery over the mts 2010 2013 consistently indicate that the emsp have perform less well than the other subprogramme since 2010,negative
1228,rather the impression be of a mixed portfolio of initiative that lack overall coherence and integration that result from the continuation of work initiate in biennia prior to the 2010 2013 period,negative
1229,unfortunately this project suffer particular challenge especially lack of funding and although corporate level communication effort around emsp project be often strong overall communication of key emsp message and result have be poorly coordinate and not deliver effectively across the subprogramme and in general communication have be a weak area of subprogramme delivery,negative
1230,unfortunately the review could not be deliver in 2013 but -PRON- be complete in october 2014 and should help guide the communication of key concept and message for the new mts 2014 2017,negative
1231,this do not encourage and support dissemination replication or catalysis of emsp project result and present a poor impression of unep,negative
1232,opportunity for unep to add value have be lose where project effort at local level have not be explicitly link to strategic objective such as pilot or demonstrate tool and methodology to inform policy,negative
1233,however unep project team often make use of establish system effort and synergy such as reliance on well establish national or local partner for field activity,negative
1234,efficiency have be affect by significant delay to some emsp project for a variety of external and internal reason which have inevitably mean high staff and administrative cost,negative
1235,while some project have have specific strategy to disseminate technical output in other instance -PRON- be unclear who should promote these knowledge product,negative
1236,the lack of an overall emsp strategy to ensure a coherent approach to capacity development have reduce the likelihood of institutional sustainability,negative
1237,even in the country where unep have already provide intensive support awareness and capacity for ecosystem management remain fragile and may need far strengthen for a considerable time to come,negative
1238,also judge from the case study some emsp project do not implement the governance structure envisage in project document such as project steer committee which have sometimes jeopardise the prospect for sustainability particularly of local result although there be exception notably the teeb,negative
1239,also there be no overall replication strategy or approve communication plan for the subprogramme as a whole which could have be another source of add value at subprogramme level,negative
1240,replication often take place after a project have end so would need to be measure at the subprogramme level with resource establish to track this,negative
1241,however the link between the remain concept and implement project be not always clear,negative
1242,while these be not necessarily unique to the emsp -PRON- have affect delivery of the emsp,negative
1243,there have also be no funding for establish baseline against which subsequent progress and achievement could be measure,negative
1244,this shortfall in funding lead to a need to downscale project with activity reduce or cancel particularly in the case of demonstration project,negative
1245,project need to develop supplement at the start of a new biennium and to realign the project to new pow output,negative
1246,similarly whilst the work may be valuable and -PRON- may be relevant to the emsp accountability to the original expect result be sometimes lose,negative
1247,administrative regulation and procedure in unep be also not well adapt for field base operation and have lead to many delay and frustration which sometimes affect the credibility of unep in the eye of partner,negative
1248,the main purpose of the programmatic layer have be to align project within the portfolio which have be accomplish to a certain extent but be uneven with the result that some project have drift or be less relevant to the subprogramme,negative
1249,lesson learning be poor and inconsistent across the subprogramme with very little interaction and learning between the different project in the emsp and sharing expertise be weak to the point where some project be operate as silos reflect an organizational level problem,negative
1250,at the same time project implement in a particular country have sometimes be design as separate intervention with few if any linkage and there be little sense of a coherent portfolio of emsp project at country level,negative
1251,field activity and capacity building initiative be report to have be develop in a top down manner at headquarters level with insufficient consultation with ros and little interaction with country in establish priority design intervention and determine allocation of resource,negative
1252,the evaluation also find limited evidence of linkage between emsp project where the potential for strong linkage and synergy would seem to exist such as in the area of ecosystem service valuation and economics project,negative
1253,however motivation of staff deliver emsp project be undermine by the feeling of insufficient transparency in decision make in emsp programming and particularly over resource allocation,negative
1254,none of the case study project have develop clear resource mobilisation strategy and -PRON- adopt different approach to resource mobilisation,negative
1255,shortfall in resource mobilisation particularly affect the first biennium where many project begin without adequate funding and some with no funding at all,negative
1256,however the depth of partnership as well as distribution of role and responsibility vary,negative
1257,this have limit the ownership of project design although local partnership be usually develop at a later date once financing be secure,negative
1258,similarly -PRON- be difficult to specify policy outcome in a result base framework,negative
1259,consequently engagement with the private sector by the emsp have not be as extensive as be hope,negative
1260,however there be a number of issue with the formulation and use of milestone that call -PRON- suitability into question,negative
1261,in general the role and responsibility of report focal point in relation to the role and responsibility of project manager and the spc in the emsp reporting cycle be not clear,negative
1262,other type of under report include policy outcome catalyse by project but which be deliver after closure of the project and project extend into a new pow biennium or mts period whose report result at project level may contribute to early output or eas,negative
1263,the emsp result framework do not provide an adequate basis for focusse the work deliver under the emsp or for result base management rbm,negative
1264,an underlie difficulty in frame the emsp be that -PRON- be build around a set of approach group together under the broad concept of ecosystem management,negative
1265,however the subprogramme have lack a coherent capacity need analysis that set out what and where specific tool and methodology be require,negative
1266,however the protocol be still not in force by the end of 2013 so there have be limit opportunity to deliver plan emsp activity in the 2010 2013 period,negative
1267,there be a number of factor that have contribute positively or negatively to the delivery and performance of the emsp during the 2010 2013 period or which have put the future sustainability of achievement at risk,negative
1268,the quality of project proposal review for the evaluation case study be variable,negative
1269,there have be limit investment in project planning and development with resource sometimes draw from ongoing project,negative
1270,the current evaluation confirm that these factor affect emsp delivery during the 2010 2013 period,negative
1271,there have also be no real sense of a team effort across the emsp and cohesion and team work within the subprogramme could be improve,negative
1272,the emsp have natural affinity with the ccsp and dcsp but synergy tend to happen base on personal contact and on a case by case basis rather than through joint programming,negative
1273,this weak internal collaboration and exchange have be exacerbate by several factor such as the difficulty of pool resource across division weak incentive to promote in house collaboration and a lack of dedicated staff time for knowledge exchange and mutual support,negative
1274,the ceap model -PRON- entail high transaction cost and intensive capacity building at the service actor ngo or government partner and community level which may be well undertake by agency other than unep,negative
1275,the quadrangular jurisdiction between unep hq in nairobi depi pcdmb in geneva undp khartoum and the country office be at good inefficient and in some case directly obstructive to the programme,negative
1276,the constraint to success be primarily related to staffing and resource and the fact that expectation have be raise which can not be satisfied in the current aid climate,negative
1277,the dysfunctional management arrangement currently in place between nairobi geneva and khartoum need to be revise to take into account the requirement of work flexibly and with a degree of decentralized authority commensurate with good practice in such situation,negative
1278,overall moderately unlikely mu,negative
1279,however biosafety system be not yet operational in many country and have to be prove in more challenging situation concrete opportunity to test collegiality and decision making in presence of gmos application,negative
1280,some of -PRON- be due to the fact that all the strategy that be mea related be mainly shape by the convention process to which the un contribute,negative
1281,sustainability in this context be dynamic and in this context the evaluation deem that sustainability of gef unep biosafety strategy be currently still less than suitable hence rate moderately unlikely mu,negative
1282,the use of financial and time resource have not be optimal despite the huge effort make by the management team in ensure monitoring transparency and accountability through an innovative information system anubis,negative
1283,the overall capacity of unep to respond to project implementation and management challenge have to be rate moderately unsatisfactory mu,negative
1284,-PRON- be rate moderately unsatisfactory see 4.7,negative
1285,however efficiency have be strongly challenge by high management cost and an excessively protract timeframe,negative
1286,the progress towards impact have be uneven along the 123 country and external factor be challenge socio political and financial sustainability,negative
1287,the unep biosafety strategy be not clearly define and there be concern regard -PRON- sustainability,negative
1288,highly variable between three main group of country see 4.3.3 section d,negative
1289,at the current stage socio political sustainability be rate moderately unlikely mu,negative
1290,in retrospect unep have not show a clear biosafety management strategy which be lead to a rather unsustainable management situation as far as biosafety be concerned see 4.4.5,negative
1291,despite some inconsistency in the log frame the mt have be able to implement an information system anubis and other monitoring tool,negative
1292,overall project design have major challenge relate to definition of outcome and the use of pow output as subproject outcome,negative
1293,the monitoring that be do for sub project be often informal or not record and not available in one full and comprehensive monitoring plan serve the purpose of track progress and clear attribution for the entire umbrella,negative
1294,this be cause by change in government and overly optimistic assessment of the length of consultation and validation process as well as administrative and operative challenge,negative
1295,the lack of country presence imply that un environment staff be not directly involve in national policy process and -PRON- need collaboration with other agency to stimulate change,negative
1296,this affect reporting monitoring and attribution,negative
1297,however the umbrella project structure do form challenge for attribution planning and monitoring,negative
1298,the implementation of regulation incentive and measure be still incipient and scatter and can only be consider early example of ge application in practice,negative
1299,inclusion of awareness raising and communication activity into the plan project activity could have possibly far strengthen the impact of these effort,negative
1300,communication and awareness raise with the public at large be not clearly plan in the original project design and could have strengthen the project possible impact,negative
1301,on monitor and report the evaluation have find that initially the project do not fully comply with the timeline monitoring and reporting obligation as describe in the sign pca due to start up difficulty and a lack of guidance from un environment due to personnel change,negative
1302,however the contribution of the research committee to and -PRON- influence on knowledge generation be find to be uneven due to a range of factor include limited financial capacity available to support -PRON- functioning,negative
1303,online exchange and knowledge networking have not be priority area of work and therefore moderate achievement be find on build and facilitate a dynamic green growth community of practice,negative
1304,salient factor limit uptake of the knowledge provide by the ggkp be lack of financial resource and lack of partnership,negative
1305,however the draft have never be formally endorse at a superior level the epa policy council see chapter 5.4.1,negative
1306,mitigate those risk have prove to be virtually unsurmountable for the project team that have to give up on attain some relevant expect output like the endorsement of the biosafety policy the approval of the draft biosafety law and of subsequent regulation,negative
1307,these achievement however do not receive adequate institutional and socio political support,negative
1308,project design quality be assess in inception report and find weak in intend result and causality logical framework and monitoring governance and supervision arrangement,negative
1309,implement few year after a devastating and long- last civil war,negative
1310,to a limited extent measure design to move towards intermediate state have start but do not produce yet tangible result,negative
1311,weak institutional and technical framework so far,negative
1312,-PRON- be not obvious that these resource will be available in the short term to fully use the capacity build by the project although many international actor be work to design facilitate policy and instrument,negative
1313,international resource panel be implement an approach to generate policy relevant knowledge that be not base on a contemporary critical knowledge of how science actually reach and influence policy,negative
1314,there be assumption make about the ability and willingness of government and other partner to assume responsibility and take over from unhcr as well as about the transfer of residual responsibility to the regional office in pretoria in the context of the regionalization policy,negative
1315,the decision do not include a transparent analysis of underlie assumption and precondition that could have guide field office as a result appropriate strategy with clear indicator operational milestone and roadmap be not develop base on such analysis and could not be use to support the review of progress in subsequent year,negative
1316,the extent to which reduction in overall expenditure be attributable to the 2013 decision can not be calculate due to limited tracking of resource that go toward the phase down process and of the unintended additional cost and liability -PRON- generate,negative
1317,nevertheless when the 2013 decision be make the intend outcome be formulate only in term of office structure and presence,negative
1318,the available organizational planning guidance do not provide sufficient support to the office on this issue include on what standard for protection and assistance could be agree with government,negative
1319,by 2016 unhcr be less able to carry out protection and solution activity for person of concern directly and through partner,negative
1320,recipient of unhcr cash be less likely to earn income in the formal sector with access to work as a precursor to be less likely to earn income in the formal job market,negative
1321,the unhcr refugee -PRON- d card be not always accept by school for enrolment and few refugee youth if any have attend the secondary and senior secondary national open school a distance learn format high school,negative
1322,access service and justice be also a challenge,negative
1323,the mission find that one of the main challenge face by unhcr in -PRON- response to the emerge crisis be the timely dispatch of sufficient number of qualified and experienced technical staff,negative
1324,moreover a number of institutional bureaucratic and operational impediment further reduce the pace at which unhcr be able to respond to the unfold crisis result in an initially insufficient scale up to respond to the emergency,negative
1325,however a concern raise by a large majority of ho respondent as well as unhcr uk respondent be the need for more consistent ongoing communication particularly with the high level policy and decision maker in the ho,negative
1326,when the new urban refugee policy be introduce in 2009 the office charge with -PRON- implementation do not receive dedicated resource for that purpose nor be -PRON- provide with additional staff,negative
1327,in malaysia such advocacy effort have not yet succeed in persuade the authority to assume a more substantial role in relation to refugee issue and unhcr have consequently be oblige to assume responsibility for a wide variety of function include registration status determination documentation and detention monitoring good interest determination for child as well as assistance in the area of health education livelihood and the search for solution,negative
1328,in malaysia however there be no solution in sight for the majority of refugee even in the medium or long term,negative
1329,at a provincial level there be a lack of practical guidance for targeted support to person with specific need,negative
1330,this underestimate coverage since information management and reporting system do not consider protection mainstreaming activity in other cluster and monitoring and evaluation m&e system do not track how protection monitoring datum be use,negative
1331,most non food item nfi procure for l3 operations in kasai be distribute 5- 6 month after need assessment have be conduct reduce -PRON- effectiveness,negative
1332,a key challenge for unhcr lead coordination system be not only to avoid duplication but mainly to optimise value add of the limited resource available,negative
1333,key gap during the l3 response include the lack of protocol to address protection need lack of coherence between different protection work group difficulty in agree on harmonise standard data management and turnover of cluster coordinator,negative
1334,due to a combination of internal and external factor notably critical gap in funding and staffing protection monitoring do not influence delivery of service and assistance as plan,negative
1335,the interagency protection strategy of the humanitarian coordination team hct in drc be approve in april 2018 follow a prolonged process which mean there be no agree protection strategy to guide the overall l3 response,negative
1336,unhcr in drc do not wait for the declaration of the system wide l3 emergency to start provide assistance but -PRON- do so with limited resource in a context where the government do not authorise an initial assessment by the protection cluster,negative
1337,the protection cluster report achieve only 8 coverage of need for the overall response,negative
1338,there be a lack of systematic reporting of outcome by unhcr and most of -PRON- implement partner during the period cover by the l3 declaration even though protection monitoring could have potentially provide outcome datum for both advocacy initiative and intervention at a community level,negative

1400,with no dedicated nutrition focal point at addis ababa level however the response management be primarily reactive with limited strategic thinking around long term strategy and sustainable programming,negative
1401,coverage rate for nutrition programme be extremely poor due to weak preventive measure limited community involvement and a weak outreach system,negative
1402,on the whole however food distribution in the transit centre be ad hoc,negative
1403,mortality rate in the unhcr health information system -PRON- be too low to be credible and be contradict by a retroactive mortality study,negative
1404,condition in transit centre be appalling for the first few month of the crisis and deteriorate again with each new wave of refugee arrival or delay in relocation,negative

1412,unhcr operation in northern uganda be scale down at the time of the influx and there be no specific contingency planning or preparedness for the emergency that ensue,negative

1417,the large investment in service infrastructure reception centre health and educational facility could be challenge to long term sustainability and maintenance,negative
1418,sectoral approach and intervention therefore only partially contribute positively to protection outcome and in some case may have expose people of concern to unnecessary protection risk for example at transit center,negative
1419,the need for nationality screening due to the difficulty in determine 340 whether asylum seeker overwhelmingly belong to the nuer ethnic group which be find on both side of the border be ethiopian or south sudanese however cause many registration suspension and together with the difficulty in find suitable land delay movement to the camp result in long wait period at transit centre at border crossing,negative

1423,a particularly negative consequence of this situation be to be find in the length and inefficiency of the process whereby refugee register with unhcr have -PRON- status determine and be issue with refugee certificate,negative
1424,this decision have create frustration among the nnt,negative
1425,the common approach and cooperation between the un agency have be difficult and implementation have be seriously delay both because of bureau- cratic hurdle and internal difficulty among the un organization as well as constraint in the government system,negative
1426,however the appropri- ateness support provide to the reintegration process in burundi be of concern give the underestimation of the special condition and need of the 1972 group,negative
1427,furthermore the linking of naturalisation pillar 2 and relocation the initial step of pillar 3 raise concern from a right perspective,negative
1428,-PRON- be indicate that unhcr have a top down approach rather than a partnership approach and do not sufficiently value the skill and knowledge of the implement partner,negative
1429,however with regard to reintegration in burundi the second part of pil- lar 1 the achievement seem to fall short of expectation,negative
1430,in general burundian refugee appear to have have difficulty in reintegration and the 1972 group have face particular problem because of -PRON- length of absence,negative
1431,pillar 2 be therefore likely to be complete at an unknown point in time,negative
1432,nevertheless the non issuance of citizen certificate question the overall effectiveness and show that effectiveness be hamper when political issue be at play,negative
1433,there could also be other factor which could erode the potential achievement of long term and sustainable livelihood,negative
1434,there remain a few area for improvement,negative
1435,driver and partner ask to be consult more during the vehicle ordering process,negative
1436,country operation report some confusion about a few aspect of the process,negative
1437,despite this country operation and unchr partner resist return retire vehicle and there be a gap of approximately 50 percent between the number of vehicle identify for disposal and the number turn in,negative
1438,"consider gfm bring in about 1,000 new vehicle each year and that gfm will start disposal of gfm rental vehicle as of 2019 close this gap be essential",negative
1439,however in 2017 there be a sharp increase in the average vehicle fleet age in europe and asia pacific ap because as note above country operation be not dispose of vehicle accord to the disposal policy,negative
1440,country operation have not yet put in place all the process to effectively use the tracking system and -PRON- datum,negative
1441,gfm staff feel that this process be complex and time consuming and that not all revenue have be credit gfm budget,negative
1442,this be evident in the limited resource invest in manage the fleet and little ownership especially at senior management level of the importance of fleet management,negative
1443,datum mileage and vehicle utilization be also not analyze in part because of lack of capacity in country operation and as result be not use for planning and right size the fleet,negative
1444,indeed while the majority of unhcr vehicle meet either the euro 1 or 3 standard i.e. pollute between 3 and 15 time more than the euro 6 standard greener vehicle manufacture for african and asian market be simply not available,negative
1445,however the evaluation find that gfm and country operation could do more to ensure the use of simple eco driving technique and well trip planning,negative
1446,country operation have express concern about excessive lead time and double charge for vehicle rental,negative
1447,another issue hamper the full functioning of gfm be that light vehicle management do not appear to be an operational priority for country operation,negative
1448,in general unhcr fleet data management be weak,negative
1449,unhcr should consider assume a high profile in the poc process give -PRON- role of protector of a significant proportion of civilian affect by conflict,negative
1450,however -PRON- do so in a limited manner as -PRON- relate only to situation of armed conflict,negative
1451,hence where -PRON- do materialize this involvement be limited hesitant and relatively slow annexe 2 and 3,negative
1452,in many other instance however the funding pattern have be less positive,negative
1453,with a grow appreciation of protection issue associate with natural disaster and give the dissatisfaction with the current system of designate the protection cluster lead at the country level the high commissioner have now propose that unhcr play a more predictable role in displacement arise from natural disaster,negative
1454,guidance note on use the cluster approach to strengthen humanitarian response have prove to be dysfunctional,negative
1455,in the context of great awareness by the international community of the likelihood of an increase in the number and intensity of sudden onset natural disaster and because of a well appreciation of the protection need of those affect by such disaster there be now grow pressure for the iasc and the three designate core- protection agency unhcr unicef ohchr to redress this generally perceive weakness,negative
1456,of this number unhcr have an operational involvement in thirteen 13 and in a further 5 -PRON- involvement take some other form donation of tent etc,negative
1457,by way of example the unhcr component in the flash appeal for the philippines hurricane 2009 and the haiti earthquake 2010 have receive no contribution by 13 april 2010,negative
1458,if unhcr miss an initial flash appeal which be the case in regard to the flash appeal for the philippines and haiti and give the linkage between rapid response grant under cerf and flash appeal then the chance of unhcr resourcing involvement in sudden impact disaster be reduce significantly,negative
1459,this leadership have not be forthcoming in some situation for example the haiti earthquake response,negative
1460,the presence of some 150 people in a coordination meeting of the protection cluster as be the case in haiti be not a recipe for success,negative
1461,there have not be the good use of local ngos in the haiti response there need to be a well interface between the international community and civil society,negative
1462,on the other hand as this study have show there be a range of issue that require the engagement of excom in elaborate in partnership with the high commissioner the detail regard how the office can respond to this possible new commitment include -PRON- financial administrative and operational implication without prejudice to -PRON- core mandate for refugee protection and assistance,negative
1463,this be nevertheless a major challenge give the heavy demand on field team particularly in the early phase of the return movement,negative
1464,significant gap therefore persist in this sector particularly for vulnerable returnee family include many female head household,negative
1465,a comprehensive assessment of the situation in return area be not possible government restriction on ngo access limited programming option and the accelerated return process be initiate rapidly and with little advance warning,negative
1466,the grant be negotiate directly with the government by unhcr and lead to tension within the shelter cluster,negative
1467,"around 100,000 idps remain in menik farm and the area east of the a9 road have still not be clear for return at the time of writing",negative
1468,"these include more than 70,000 displace from high security zone and 65,000 muslims forcibly displace from ltte hold area in the early 1990 and currently reside in puttalam district in north- western sri lanka",negative
1469,nonetheless significant gap remain in a number of sector,negative
1470,the extent of shelter destruction appear to have be underestimate 4 and the expectation that the majority of house would be repairable use the grant provide have not be meet,negative
1471,the grant be also not conceive under optimal condition,negative
1472,this result in some difficulty in manage the implementation of the grant at field level,negative
1473,despite a revive local economy and rapid progress in re establish public service in particular school and infrastructure rehabilitation significant gap remain,negative
1474,however an early focus on the sustainability of the project would have be advisable and in some respect the partnership with other praesidium partner fall short of a collective joint vision and strategy,negative
1475,recent development in italy have show that the effectiveness of such a mechanism be to a large extent determine by the extent to which -PRON- be situate within an enable policy environment which may be shape by a range of factor largely independent of the model -PRON-,negative
1476,unhcr have express significant concern about this policy shift and at the time of the evaluation mission the reception centre on lampedusa be empty,negative
1477,however as already note the praesidium approach be not a panacea,negative
1478,most of -PRON- consider that current condition in iraq prevent -PRON- from repatriate while a significant number state that -PRON- have no intention of return there under any circumstance,negative
1479,the question now loom over the operation be whether -PRON- will be possible to maintain the protection space that have be establish in recent year if there be inadequate resource available to assist the refugee and to support the service on which -PRON- rely,negative
1480,the task be also complicate by a number of additional factor include -PRON- limited presence and stand in the middle east the absence of refugee law and institution in the country of asylum as well as -PRON- overriding preoccupation with other issue include the palestinian refugee question national security and regional geopolitic,negative
1481,first the expansion of protection space have be base largely on understanding and agreement between unhcr and the authority which be yet to be institutionalize and which may be reverse if negative development be to take place in the political economic or security environment,negative
1482,a final concern derive from the very real prospect that the funding available to unhcr and -PRON- partner will decline in the month and year to come,negative
1483,for the impact area of access to loan from a financial institution and access to formal and long term employment the result be variable,negative
1484,the five case study confirm these result,negative
1485,yet the et find that even with good standard in place the implementation of the standard and overall quality and effectiveness of the programme will continue to be comprise under a one year project cycle,negative
1486,one in five operation report that access to cash intervention or other assistance hinder poc desire to participate in livelihood,negative
1487,as the livelihood sector of unhcr move more toward operational partner and capacity building and as improve monitoring continue to develop new outcome and impact indicator be need to measure system level change,negative
1488,baseline assessment and monitoring activity be consider useful where available though the quality and availability of these monitoring activity be often constrain by partner capacity resource and the one year timing,negative
1489,the political legal security environmental and economic environment have a substantial effect on the ultimate achievement of refugee economic inclusion,negative
1490,external factor affect efficiency and effectiveness be partner capacity relate also to partner selection an internal issue and the legal and economic enable environment,negative
1491,poc mind set be another factor affect outcome,negative
1492,in general unhcr be limit in monitoring and evaluation activity there be a great need to have dedicate staff for this domain,negative
1493,two third 67 per cent of e survey respondent feel the sustainability of -PRON- livelihood programme be unlikely if unhcr funding end,negative
1494,the capacity of the branch office however have not be commensurate with the challenge pose by the situation in the canary island,negative
1495,while all new arrival receive information on -PRON- right to seek asylum many do not adequately understand the information -PRON- receive and as a result do not exercise -PRON- right,negative
1496,there be continue concern with respect to the accuracy of the procedure use to determine the nationality of new arrival,negative
1497,access to the detention centre by cear lawyer be limited and as a result -PRON- do not make contact with all potential asylum seeker,negative
1498,unaccompanied minor in the canary island be not adequately advise of -PRON- right to seek asylum nor be there adequate procedure in place to identify asylum seeker among this population,negative
1499,either sur be not actually seek or there be disagreement over what -PRON- be and where -PRON- be likely to achieve the target result,negative
1500,in these circumstance the organization be oblige to rely on many volunteer from other unhcr operation in the region as well external deployee,negative
1501,unhcr have to rely on the expertise of other agency with mixed result,negative
1502,indeed important restriction continue to be place on the right of such person while both egypt and tunisia remain opposed to the local integration of refugee on -PRON- territory,negative
1503,sustain this response do not prove easy,negative
1504,unhcr struggle to find deployee with appropriate skill in programme administration and protection with the exception of resettlement while the organization have to rely on external expertise in technical area such as water sanitation health and site planning,negative
1505,in term of material assistance the lightweight emergency tent that be originally distribute to accommodate refugee and migrant in tunisia be not suit to local condition and quickly become unusable,negative
1506,more generally however the evacuation and resettlement effort undertake by unhcr and iom do not appear to have expand the protection space available to person of concern in both country,negative
1507,in particular during the first half of 2011 arra keep tight control over -PRON- role as implement partner limit the opening up of humanitarian space to international agency despite lack the resource and experience need to scale up quickly to the unfold emergency,negative
1508,finally telecommunication be limit with implication on communication and coordination function,negative
1509,this mean that on an individual basis there be often gap from the end of one cycle to the beginning of another,negative
1510,the main reason give for low wheat grain consumption be a preference for other grain,negative
1511,there be also a limit communication network hamper information flow,negative
1512,request for additional funding be submit to unhcr hq start in late may 2011 two month after nutrition survey result depict a series situation and after the entire current allocation have be exhaust,negative
1513,great humanitarian space for more international and technically competent partner and international recognition of the crisis be need,negative
1514,a number of respondent indicate that -PRON- appear that the unhcr office be overwhelmed in the face of the emergency,negative
1515,the magnitude of the number and severity of condition be overwhelming and capacity of agency to cope be overstretch,negative
1516,this make the coordination and effective implementation of program very difficult,negative
1517,however a major finding of the evaluation be failure in the adequacy and appropriateness of assistance provide at transit centre in particular food and nutrition sanitation and shelter,negative
1518,once the response begin in earnest in july 2011 the correct intervention be employ but not to a sufficient scale and inconsistent in the quality of performance,negative
1519,the compete role of arra present a complexity to the response that be unique to the context,negative
1520,a centralised food distribution system compound by limited capacity for most of 2011 result in distribution cycle that could take up to 2 to 3 week through the course of 2011,negative
1521,with almost no livelihood opportunity or resource reserve refugee household have a high dependence on food assistance to generate income,negative
1522,the office at both the addis and dollo level be operate on a minimum of staff with little reserve capacity when the emergency arise,negative
1523,around a third of the stakeholder interview feel that there be a lack of unhcr leadership in particular in first half of the year when preparedness activity be lack and the response be slow,negative
1524,at headquarters there be poor situational analysis and a well need for systemic response mechanism,negative
1525,there be gap in the coherence and coordination of the response,negative
1526,the review conclude that unhcr lack the capacity and expertise to monitor the social and economic reintegration of avr participant in country of origin and that the organization should not seek to expand -PRON- activity in this domain,negative
1527,to that end unhcr rosa need a revised relevant and coherent strategy develop follow consultation with government civil society and independent analyst,negative
1528,the lack of such a strategy lead to be more reactive and try to do everything instead of prioritise and link different actor give -PRON- competency,negative
1529,this may have make sense early in the response but be now questionable give the increase protection issue in jordan,negative
1530,this increase coincide with a near closure of the border to incoming refugee,negative
1531,a quick response be necessary to save life yet -PRON- can also become the modus operandi of an operation,negative
1532,yet unhcr risk become a victim of -PRON- own success,negative
1533,unhcr have develop way of work with host government that now signal the long term consequence of such choice,negative
1534,finally unhcr country office in jordan and lebanon lack fundamental tool and approach for effective financial management i.e. use monthly cash flow analysis to monitor manage and continuously improve operational performance,negative
1535,these and other issue point to a pattern of be reactive rather than strategic,negative
1536,however psea governance and staff and management responsibility and accountability on psea be not yet as clear as -PRON- need to be to ensure effective mainstreaming,negative
1537,the agdm strategy do not have the weight of official unhcr policy nor have any clear vision be lay out that state what unhcr will look like and be able to do once agd mainstreaming be complete,negative
1538,nevertheless the executive committee in particular have not fully meet -PRON- responsibility in ensure adequate oversight and accountability and that the af fulfil -PRON- plan purpose,negative
1539,-PRON- indicate that -PRON- do not always understand what -PRON- expectation of the exercise should be that pas be something be do to -PRON- rather than with -PRON- and -PRON- often have no information about action after datum gathering so -PRON- believe -PRON- problem have be ignore and less likely to want to participate again,negative
1540,yet overall senior management leadership have be variable and appear to be too dependent on the personal commitment of individual country representative and deputy representative rather than on a systematic agency wide approach to mainstreaming,negative
1541,-PRON- have also make numerous recommendation concern how the agdm strategy and -PRON- pa methodology could be improve and look to unhcr to build a great sense of shared ownership over agdm and -PRON- tool,negative
1542,as lack of staff and fund be commonly cite among the most important factor that have hinder great progress on the agdm strategy at field and country level -PRON- would be important for donor to consider way to support country operation that show a willingness to improve performance on agdm but currently do not have the mean to undertake target action on behalf of under protect and at risk population group,negative
1543,unhcr have limit capacity to ensure that these can be apply consistently and effectively by country operation,negative
1544,at the same time in no operation -PRON- be aware of be -PRON- possible to ensure target action that address the full range of protection gap and heighten risk identify as new protection gap be emerge,negative
1545,however staff be assess on aggregate rather than individual indicator,negative
1546,the agdm strategy be be view as an annual participatory assessment that comprise ask refugee what -PRON- need and problem be,negative

4334,give the current situation in europe -PRON- could be argue that more responsibility sharing could be expect and the existence of the etcs should not absolve these government of the obligation to provide durable solution to a great number of refugee,neutral
4335,in the word of one interlocutor there be nothing emergency about this process,neutral
4336,however although key project position be fill early many project initiative be delay due to fao administrative process and requirement,negative
4337,moreover some element of the project be overly complex and result in inefficiency and delay particularly in relation to the ems pilot in ghana,negative
4338,partnership with government be strong at local level than at national level and this may have compromise the capacity of the project to influence the wide policy and enable environment,negative
4339,partnership with ngos be undermine in some case through short duration letter of agreement contract,negative
4340,the quality of monitoring and reporting be mix at the project level and weak at the programme level,negative
4341,the evaluation experience difficulty in learn what be happen even at country level,negative
4342,the project paper trail be fragmented and difficult to follow and the lack of formal document procedure accentuate the problem arise from the very lean management structure,negative
4343,decision make process be ill define and poorly understand,negative
4344,formalize and streamlined procedure would also have the potential to reduce transaction cost and potentially attract additional donor funding,negative
4345,however -PRON- be see as especially problematic within fmm,negative
4346,the fmm resource partner maintain that the problem be procedural rather than cause by erratic funding by the donor,negative
4347,whatever the cause or combination of cause -PRON- be clear that this be a problem that need to be address,negative
4348,however -PRON- be still too early and not yet clear if the work on the ipc chronic food insecurity classification scale and the nutrition scale will be widely adopt,negative
4349,the ipc chronic scale be a new tool launch in 2014 and the ipc nutrition scale be still in development stage with -PRON- release expect in 2016.3,negative
4350,however participation at the decision make level varie from country to country,negative
4351,furthermore the gender balance among beneficiary of capacity development effort be dependent upon the exist staffing structure in ministry of agriculture and nsos,negative
4352,the funding gap usd 3.73 million at the global office level primarily affect the research component,negative
4353,-PRON- could also affect dissemination and field testing of research result on complete work,negative
4354,much more follow up support at country level be need,negative
4355,all of this be beyond the current capacity of the gsu,negative
4356,but -PRON- be infrequently cite as a source of information for decision making and be not currently inform policy,negative
4357,-PRON- have substantial potential to complement the afi and encourage a more holistic analysis of food security but -PRON- be not yet fulfil that potential,negative
4358,in fact esn have have a number of vacancy which -PRON- use to hire human resource on a short term basis through consultancy contract,negative
4359,as of february 2018 esn have seven vacant post,negative
4360,a nutrition trust fund set up by fao after the icn2 conference be never promote to donor and never accrue to,negative
4361,as a result fao lack resource to fund what essentially amount to a whole new area of work and esn have have to absorb an increase in the scope of -PRON- work all the while lose some key staff resource,negative
4362,many technical unit engage in resilience relate policy in a scatter manner,negative
4363,the different tool and system develop by fao for early warning and food security information be still manage in a disperse manner without much integration and synergy between -PRON-,negative
4364,similarly fao lack an integrate one health strategic action plan that would consider all three empre pillar,negative
4365,resilience programming be not fundamentally new to fao,negative
4366,the evolution towards development orient crisis surveillance preparedness and response start before so5,negative
4367,insufficient attention have be pay to knowledge management so far,negative
4368,a reform of the type undertake by fao need a strong knowledge sharing effort and infrastructure,negative
4369,this be especially important for so5 which encapsulate a programmatic shift towards resilience,negative
4370,the activity relate to the strengthening of the bocaina mosaic include the establishment of a permanent executive structure be largely base on a misconception at the time the project be conceive,negative
4371,this be the failure to recognize the essence of the mosaic concept which be consultative rather than executive,negative
4372,eventually due to the nature of the mosaic the many stakeholder involve political interest and other issue more conflict arise and by 2016 the bocaina mosaic activity come to a standstill,negative
4373,bod biological oxygen demand value have not be reduce,negative
4374,-PRON- be foresee that the considerable investment in sanitation by the municipality of angra dos reis and paraty would include sewage water treatment expectation that do not materialize,negative
4375,this can be attribute to the fact that during formulation the contribution of the municipality be not make sufficiently specific,negative
4376,as a result the municipality set priority within the scope of sanitation but which do not contribute to the achievement of project objective,negative
4377,however at project conception -PRON- be wrongly consider that the mosaic be to have an executive character where in reality -PRON- be merely consultative,negative
4378,ultimately activity relate to the mosaic come to a standstill and be eventually abandon,negative
4379,conclusion 2,negative
4380,the project be not able to deliver significantly on -PRON- output relate to the bocaina mosaic which have serious consequence for achieve improved integrated management of ecosystem of global importance in the bocaina mosaic,negative
4381,conclusion 5,negative
4382,the project fail to deliver on the reduction of the bod value,negative
4383,the ftpp be design without a robust result framework or theory of change toc,negative
4384,the et reconstruct the intended toc figure 2 which show that the robustness and realism of the intend objective depend on stakeholder that be not include namely actor that can reach beneficiary at the field level such as non governmental organization ngos and community base organization cbos,negative
4385,with very few exception the implementation have not include partner that can facilitate result in the field,negative
4386,moreover the operational and financial framework lack effective management and follow up system for the project and be not well understand by partner especially regard the division of role and responsibility,negative
4387,despite the gender issue inherent in most project for example no gender analysis be conduct,negative
4388,the discussion with stakeholder at all level reveal a significant gap in capacity attitude and knowledge regard gender equality as well as how this issue could be address,negative
4389,the draft policy and strategic plan be either not approve or the approval be still in process,negative
4390,the evaluation attribute this issue to a lack of ownership of the document,negative
4391,however the programme start without either a real design or result base framework,negative
4392,as a consequence of the miss programme framework the project lack coherence and the output and outcome do not lead to the goal initially envisage for the programme,negative
4393,most of the scatter and small project be unable to achieve impact in isolation as the challenge -PRON- address be often interdependent,negative
4394,moreover these project do not collaborate with large programme on related issue,negative
4395,as a result some of the achievement e.g. strategic plan and policy develop be isolate and disconnect from the programme as a whole,negative
4396,this be especially the case for field orient programme such as cattle production watershed management and home base nursery where the activity be develop around community organization,negative
4397,moreover -PRON- be note that the selection and training process for workshop must ensure that participant will utilise the knowledge provide and that the target group be well define to suit the content,negative
4398,the programme aim to be demand drive,negative
4399,during the first phase however the evaluation find low level of ownership at all level in the recipient country,negative
4400,this will require great attention to the scale and impact of investment operation than merely step up resource mobilization for programme delivery,negative
4401,with the private sector play a significant role in finance the 2030 development agenda fao will also need to step up -PRON- private sector engagement,negative
4402,the main shortcoming affect the relevance of the project evaluate be the decision to fund a large number of project through two different funding window at the same time,negative
4403,this contribute to atomize funding increase the risk of overlap and affect the possibility of building mutually reinforce synergy,negative
4404,furthermore the vast majority of immediate action project do not monitor the adaptability and productivity performance of pgrfa,negative
4405,this represent a major shortcoming of the immediate action project consider the high productivity rate of local variety of bean maize millet potato and sorghum which could have be of great interest to other immediate action project especially in the same region and decision maker in build awareness at national level on the importance of pgrfa for sustainable livelihood and climate change adaptation,negative
4406,as a result the strategic action plan in most case could not be fully implement,negative
4407,however the evaluation do identify case where funded project be help to forge new alliance between farmer ngos and breeder in the interest of reduce dependency on traditional actor in pgrfa namely public institution that have diminish resource,negative
4408,immediate action project have experience difficulty in secure adequate fund since project closure,negative
4409,this have result in a large number of farmer discontinue the use of pgrfa distribute,negative
4410,however take into consideration the significant budget cut in the country since 2016 -PRON- be probable that the level of replicability will be low in the next few year due to -PRON- high cost,negative
4411,regard the replicability of economic activity the evaluation be not able to determine -PRON- level of profitability at this time as -PRON- be still be perform,negative
4412,in the majority of case observe handicraft dyeing of wool etc the indication be that the beneficiary still require train on topic such as quality control and the sale and marketing of -PRON- product and service,negative
4413,in particular the conservation and sustainable use of natural resource be mainly focus on the harvesting of water resource in the upper paramo basin and sub basin and the optimization of -PRON- use the application of a pilot model of compensation mechanism for the payment for environmental service psa,negative
4414,in contrast the conservation of biodiversity and agrobiodiversity in the paramo be much less evident partly because there be not enough awareness and recognition of -PRON- use and function,negative
4415,consequently for example -PRON- be observe that adaptation to climate change use local resistant crop in order to consolidate the food sovereignty and security of the community involve in accordance with project objective and the current legal framework particularly the law on agrobiodiversity and seed be not promote,negative
4416,fao therefore need to more loudly share lesson from pilot project and from -PRON- experience and expertise,negative
4417,this require a centralized monitoring and evaluation function well knowledge management and outreach to make sure the lesson learn from tcps and pilot be integrate into large donor fund project even if -PRON- will not be implement by fao,negative
4418,the technical working group for agriculture and water for which fao be the lead development partner facilitator could perhaps be utilize more for this purpose,negative
4419,-PRON- also limit the planned adaptive learning from resilience to climatic change,negative
4420,some farmer who be skilled in poultry breeding management be not give bird to breed as anticipate,negative
4421,however the evaluation note that other mangrove consultation framework already exist for instance the cameroon mangrove network and the project could have focus on strengthen these network,negative
4422,issue about sustainability arise because these platform do not have the financial resource to operate,negative
4423,furthermore the project do not provide for action to monitor the implementation of -PRON- action plan,negative
4424,however the study carry out by the project do not always highlight gender specificity,negative
4425,finally at community level woman have be involve to a limited extent particularly in communal forest inventory and in the executive office of the manoka community forest legal entity,negative
4426,however the design be not well balanced to ensure the adoption of a multisectoral approach in all jrp village and throughout the duration of the project the wash component cover a limited number of village in a single locality,negative
4427,a dramatic increase in the number of village to correct an initial wrong estimate of the population catchment lead to a postponement of food security and livelihood activity in about half the target village,negative
4428,this reduce the integrated dimension of jrp and compromise the quality of some intervention,negative
4429,moreover some output 4 and 5 activity be monitor as a package through aggregate indicator that could not provide quantifiable evidence of what exactly be implement,negative
4430,result and effect of activity that just start at the end of 2016 could not be measure through the last follow up survey in 2016,negative
4431,these be weak point of the m&e system that constrain the assessment of the scope and effect of the intervention,negative
4432,the revision of the cap by technical expert reduce potential ownership and buy in of the process by the community,negative
4433,however target have be discuss at the initial stage so the cap create expectation which could in turn generate frustration if target be laterconsidere not to have be achieve by community,negative
4434,this provide lesson on the involvement of community in the design of future community base resilience intervention see recommendation 3,negative
4435,while this could have be an opportunity to strengthen the capacity of ministry to work together and develop multisectoral strategy jrp do not make the most of -PRON-,negative
4436,as far as possible multisectoral programme should address the issue of national institutional mechanism to implement a multisectoral approach,negative
4437,wash component raise an issue of sustainability consider there be no effective water management committee no fee be systematically collect for most water source and locality service be weak,negative
4438,a clear strategy to ensure some sustainability rely on investment of the community and include in the cap should have be define at design stage,negative
4439,moreover adequate human resource should be allocate to mobilize community which be not inclined to pay for water,negative
4440,the choice of village should have be document in detail to clarify the various criterion use to select village the decision make process and the role of different actor involve,negative
4441,there be also a lack of clarity regard the way project resource be share between the 75 village,negative
4442,the selection of beneficiary be leave to the to the vdcs who have -PRON- own perception of equity in practice often centre exclusively on balance support to different tribal component of the community,negative
4443,though this may be a rational choice -PRON- do not reflect the initial jrp criterion,negative
4444,an obvious concentration of benefit towards certain individual who do not necessarily belong to the most vulnerable segment of the population appear as a risk besides counter the stated jrp goal of reduce vulnerability,negative
4445,effectiveness at global level suffer from the lack of agree managerial process in the management committee mc limited resource lack of staff a lack of implementation of strategic planning and limited review of progress and activity be undertake,negative
4446,the mc and the gsc be critical for the functioning of gf tad at global and regional level,negative
4447,this be reflect in the commitment of -PRON- resource human financial and organizational that be ill define and too limited to assure achievement of the agree objective,negative
4448,there be need for coordination communication and joint learning express by the region that currently can not be meet,negative
4449,even though farmer who benefit from the fao project be ready to sell -PRON- excess produce to earn cash income this be only possible in the location where there be a market near the farm,negative
4450,in addition to transportation cost timeliness and quantity of delivery of the produce represent some of the challenge experience by farmer,negative
4451,multi phase programme be need in the area require a long term holistic capacity development while training of trainer help utilize small training budget effectively,negative
4452,plan to hand over the field test prototype technology to the private sector for commercial distribution be underway as an exit strategy,negative
4453,a confound finding from analysis of casu monitoring datum be that the amount of land put under legume with conventional practice increase during the project period,negative
4454,hence while the overall proportion of land use for ca cultivation of maize increase the ca production of legume decrease in comparison to the land farm use conventional farming cf for legume production.2,negative
4455,the late start up of the activity mean that there be insufficient time to remedy these problem,negative
4456,this reflect the difficulty encounter throughout the region in identify practical and sustainable mechanization solution and finance solution for small scale farmer,negative
4457,the monitoring datum have indicate that there have be considerable variation of application of ca technique year to year and between crop,negative
4458,therefore -PRON- be not possible to assume that scaling up will continue for all crop,negative
4459,with regard to achieve the outcome of the third specific objective to educate and raise awareness among decision maker teacher student and consumer about the environmental nutritional cultural and economic value of agrobiodiversity the project be less successful,negative
4460,in particular -PRON- do not manage to develop the exchange of information lesson learn or good practice among -PRON- farmer and -PRON- intra and inter provincial organisation,negative
4461,furthermore -PRON- do not establish a communication strategy to promote agrobiodiversity,negative
4462,in particular -PRON- can be observe that iniap do not manage to pledge all of the cofinance intend particularly since 2016 due to budget restriction and political change that reduce -PRON- role in agricultural extension particularly with regard to the transfer of technology,negative
4463,-PRON- be also difficult to sign the loa with the heifer foundation that on the one hand could not take on the role of service provider without prior training by fao ec and on the other hand continue in the steering committee subsequent to the decision to apply the dim by fao ec which in effect result in the foundation play the role of both judge and defendant when -PRON- come to decision making,negative
4464,in addition the internal monitoring system and the management of risk do not contribute to improve the efficiency of planning and implementation,negative
4465,on the one hand the monitoring and management of risk be focus on pursue target to fulfil the bureaucratic need of the gef and fao,negative
4466,on the other hand the project do not establish sufficient coordination mechanism to stimulate reflection on the outcome lesson learn and good practice to replicate,negative
4467,in addition the project do not manage to establish a communication strategy to promote pass this regulation and accord to evidence available no mechanism or budget have be establish to update strengthen and broaden the main communication at an intra and inter provincial level,negative
4468,in fact the lack of communication at these level partly due to the lack of time and resource have not trigger the catalytic effect of the project,negative
4469,due to a significant delay in start the project the output be not be deliver as plan,negative
4470,the target outcome be also not on track to be achieve by the project end date,negative
4471,although the sociocultural context in upper egypt constrain fao in organize mixed group of participant in the farm school and junior farmer field and life school,negative
4472,nevertheless the project do take the initiative to disseminate good agricultural practice,negative
4473,the project have view the sector as passive recipient of information and knowledge generate by assessment of the select value chain,negative
4474,in short substantive partnership between fao and the private sector have a long way to materialize,negative
4475,however the figure be still over estimate in many case,negative
4476,there be a credibility risk if the expectation be raise too high,negative
4477,-PRON- advocacy effort be mainly target statistician and other partner work with statistic,negative
4478,the network of fao decentralize office could be use to a great extent to make the case for fie in national policy circle,negative
4479,the same apply to development partner adopt fie for project monitoring purpose,negative
4480,-PRON- be usually cheap and easy to collect datum at household level than at individual level,negative
4481,while the household level support some type of disaggregation e.g. per income group or geographic area or between male- and female- head household only datum collect at the individual level would be able to reveal potential gender difference in access to food and to the resource necessary to produce or purchase -PRON-,negative
4482,vulnerability remain despite project implementation primarily due to isolated area not easily accessible i.e. during the rainy season in the different section of bainet commune,negative
4483,this exclude some population from participation and benefit from market water and ff,negative
4484,nevertheless the project have experience significant delay with the risk that participant lose interest and motivation,negative
4485,the project will have difficulty to trigger sustainable process in the remaining year and a half,negative
4486,however climate change and gender two cross cutting issue under the current fao strategic framework be not adequately address,negative
4487,the team also find that except for several intervention that directly address irrigation and improved water practice many intervention neglect water and -PRON- role in agricultural production system,negative
4488,however ffs use a rather conservative approach often deliver standard extension advice rather than create a dynamic adaptive learning institution or community,negative
4489,furthermore ffs have a limited focus on empower the poor and landless,negative
4490,monitor at programme level be not carry out,negative
4491,this contribute to weak institutional memory,negative
4492,the recording and documentation of gender and social inclusion be generally poor and there be no follow up of activity to understand the benefit receive by the target population,negative
4493,moreover there be many miss opportunity for develop the resource and capacity of woman,negative
4494,the cpf do not provide a clear programmatic logic nor a rationale for the individual and outcome level intervention,negative
4495,during the cpf design process fao do not sufficiently involve all relevant government partner,negative
4496,in -PRON- effort to meet the expected outcome and deliver against plan fao do not systematically consider the complexity of the beneficiary population and often fail to design gender and socially inclusive intervention,negative
4497,there be a lack of institutional capacity to address gender and social issue in policy programme and project at the country level,negative
4498,land remain a contentious issue in all the fpam country and the impact of this on any similar project should not be underestimate,negative
4499,political change remain an uncertainty in most country,negative
4500,the government department involve in the project be under resource and have relatively low capability compare to -PRON- mandate,negative
4501,fao also utilize the knowledge with local institution in particular those under national agricultural research system by work with -PRON-,negative
4502,knowledge flow within fao between headquarters and the bangladesh country office be more top down than bottom up,negative
4503,knowledge from bangladesh be not adequately feed into the global knowledge pool at headquarters,negative
4504,insufficient attention to market aspect be partly due to the composition and dynamic of the project task force,negative
4505,these project be lead by technical officer with an agronomic background and no or insufficient technical input from those with economic background,negative
4506,small scale project be most useful when use as a pilot activity or seed money for large initiative,negative
4507,this require a clear exit or upscaling strategy at the design stage,negative
4508,however the exit or upscaling strategy be often detail only during project implementation,negative
4509,effort to build the capacity of the non g20 participate country could have be more effective if base on an initial assessment,negative
4510,-PRON- also could have reach a broad outcome if deploy by training systematically in each country or regionally,negative
4511,the main shortcoming affect the relevance of the project evaluate be the decision to fund a large number of project through two different funding window at the same time,negative
4512,this contribute to atomize funding increase the risk of overlap and affect the possibility of building mutually reinforce synergy,negative
4513,furthermore some overlap be identify among project in term of the country cover and the strategic action plan be formulate without information and datum flow from the immediate action project,negative
4514,furthermore the vast majority of immediate action project do not monitor the adaptability and productivity performance of pgrfa,negative
4515,this represent a major shortcoming of the immediate action project consider the high productivity rate of local variety of bean maize millet potato and sorghum which could have be of great interest to other immediate action project especially in the same region and decision maker in build awareness at national level on the importance of pgrfa for sustainable livelihood and climate change adaptation,negative
4516,such awareness be consider crucial to mainstream pgrfa into major national development plan to ensure sustainability of project fund,negative
4517,the monitoring of pgrfa performance be also important to upscale and replicate the intervention fund in different region,negative
4518,presently the office rely on emergency work to cover -PRON- running cost and on a share of project budget reserve for administrative and operational cost,negative
4519,the sustainability of this model be questionable,negative
4520,however there remain substantial gap in gender mainstreaming particularly at country level due largely to the limited resource the agency have devote to -PRON- and the weak understanding of gender by technical staff,negative
4521,as a result the consideration of the impact on woman and gender relation in project design have be uneven or unclear,negative
4522,globally fao recognize that climate change will adversely affect woman more than man but only one project in the 11 focus country visit focus on address the specific issue that woman face and develop -PRON- ability in decision making,negative
4523,this focus be possible in part due to ngo partner knowledge on the issue,negative
4524,the agency have be less active organized and strategic than -PRON- need to be in utilize potential opportunity for funding and develop common agenda with donor member country and development organization,negative
4525,finally the capacity in fao be not in place yet for the agency to adequately address the challenge of climate change to agriculture and food security,negative
4526,consider the central role of the private sector in agriculture and value chain there have be insufficient fao partnership with the sector on climate change,negative
4527,formal partnership subject to due diligence be not the only option and informal partnership have be encourage,negative
4528,on the other hand although youth have be welcome to participate and benefit from the project activity the project design and implementation do not provide specific support to engage youth in agriculture,negative
4529,the same relate to illiterate and people with disability,negative
4530,however fns strategy process be late to begin and therefore have not be complete by the time of the evaluation,negative
4531,lack of baseline fns outcome datum in the state as well as lack of primary datum collection at locality level be among the weak substantial element of the fsps- cb programme,negative
4532,random action in local community cause delay that need to be quickly resolve to minimise delay,negative
4533,the main gap in implementation be the oversight of upland rehabilitation work in river catchment,negative
4534,the evaluation find that the collaboration between fsnau and few net have not result in add value or synergy e.g. with regard to inform humanitarian response,negative
4535,on the contrary the disagreement between the two party on the analysis of the jointly collect datum and the preparation of map base on different timeline have the opposite effect create confusion among the stakeholder who utilize the analysis for emergency response,negative
4536,problem be observe however in relation to the nutrition datum as the survey result be not comparable with result for other country,negative
4537,furthermore the methodology relate to datum on stunting be question by some stakeholder however this appear to be more of a communication gap than a methodological problem,negative
4538,in contrast the evaluation find the approach to agriculture too narrow include only cereal production thereby leave out important livelihood activity such as irrigation agriculture in pastoral society,negative
4539,the livelihood classification and related information be important as -PRON- define the response,negative
4540,however even in the current phase there be a funding gap of approximately usd 5 million out of a total budget of usd 26.1 million the next phase will likely face similar funding issue,negative
4541,hence there be a need for fsnau to streamline -PRON- operation,negative
4542,ksa universities of which there be many produce large number of suitably qualify graduate who could occupy many of the position currently take by international expert,negative
4543,moreover the technical advice be offer within the programme take little account of major advance in production method,negative
4544,for example more use should be make of the biotechnology facility available in al hassa and many additional technical advance in crop production could be take advantage of,negative
4545,all project have problem with fao and moewa coordination and linkage,negative
4546,there be also limitation regard the extent of cooperation and collaboration with local and foreign institution and university,negative
4547,the research training extension model be not efficiently or effectively implement and there be major communication problem evident among partner,negative
4548,however in the implementation process the approach to capacity development be not comprehensive and the focus remain on provide training,negative
4549,moreover there be inadequate capacity building of local human resource and problem with fao and moewa coordination and linkage,negative
4550,achievement in the other two aspect of capacity development remain modest because most of the output e.g. recommendation of study framework and strategy be not approve or adopt by moewa,negative
4551,furthermore pro poor approach and gender mainstreaming be not always adequately consider at the design stage,negative
4552,the monitoring of progress towards gender equity and mainstreaming be miss,negative
4553,many continue to rely heavily on external financial assistance in the form of free resource and material from the government and fao,negative
4554,moreover the effectiveness of the handover process at provincial level be limit,negative
4555,poverty reduction objective have more linkage with social protection intervention and the support for productive enterprise to viable small and medium enterprise and value chain development,negative
4556,although policy issue be not a major focus of the project -PRON- be important to achieve the project outcome,negative
4557,when the project be terminate there be an impression that senior manager in provincial government need to be engage in accordance with the norm of conclude such project,negative
4558,this be also central to post project phase follow up which senior provincial manager need to support fully particularly since there be resource implication associate with the new phase,negative
4559,for example -PRON- be evident that some issue relate to conflict within the beneficiary group require action beyond the capacity of the project management to handle,negative
4560,these issue have implication on project sustainability,negative
4561,with regard to the civil servant participate in the workshop only very limited capacity if any appear to have be create,negative
4562,the evaluation meet with several of these trainee during the mission and none of these appear to have grasp the complex rtf concept,negative
4563,the misapprehension that rtf imply that the government be responsible for feed all people be find among maff representative and this be one of the argument of the government staff for not support the rtf,negative
4564,furthermore the project be only partly adhere to the fao policy on gender equality,negative
4565,thus the project be not base on an explicit gender analysis but partially include a gender analysis and gender relate issue be only partially include in the implementation,negative
4566,due to the evd a no cost extension be grant however even if some activity have be launch before the evd crisis condition have change and -PRON- be therefore not only a question of pick up the activity one year later,negative
4567,this in particular affect the district coordination mechanism,negative
4568,develop a thematic ca project cluster in two neighbouring country could have deliver significant and sustained synergy and some reduction in cost,negative
4569,however in practice this be not achieve,negative
4570,there have be very limited assessment of seed security in these area except in northern bahr el ghazal where the implementation of itfs be well adapt to address lack of access to seed,negative
4571,the implementation of wide scale direct seed distribution should be re assess,negative
4572,location choose for seed relief intervention be presently base on food security information which be not a relevant indicator for seed security,negative
4573,fao have not develop specific targeting criterion or guidance for -PRON- ips,negative
4574,as a result target practice varie by agency although usually involve local leadership and sometimes a dedicated committee,negative
4575,this risk unreported or unnoticed exclusion of vulnerable household,negative
4576,for example in the distribution of fishing kit targeting be partly skills- base household which have the capacity to fish,negative
4577,but this risk exclude the most vulnerable especially if -PRON- be not be reach with other form of support,negative
4578,where there have be delay in implementation for seed distribution and itfs effectiveness have be undermine,negative
4579,plant delay directly affect crop yield can lead to harvest failure and could discourage farmer from procure -PRON- own seed if -PRON- have be inform that seed aid be come,negative
4580,vaccination of as many animal as possible as widely as possible risk leave herd susceptible to disease if herd immunity level remain low and drug supply be inadequate,negative
4581,fao need to improve -PRON- vaccination recording so that herd immunity threshold can be assess,negative
4582,delivery issue to be address include ips receive input in batch rather than all at once and vaccine delivery during the rainy season when vaccination be difficult due to lack of access,negative
4583,in this context the role of the private sector deserve attention especially in state less affect by the conflict despite the challenge,negative
4584,fao must develop a policy on cost recovery which could be the basis for future privatization for example of veterinary service draw on the experience of icrc the other key actor in the livestock sector and on ols experience,negative
4585,more experienced ips some of whom have previously support the privatisation of drug supply system in south sudan recognise that free drug undermine the remain private sector drug supplier,negative
4586,consultation with affected people in need assessment be more limited,negative
4587,faoss currently do not have a function feedback mechanism to beneficiary when concern be raise,negative
4588,for example -PRON- design of seed multiplication project could have take account of previous seed sector development,negative
4589,-PRON- should also have draw on operation lifeline sudan ols experience of cost recovery approach to emergency animal health intervention,negative
4590,way of more systematically collect good practice and lesson learn in country must be seek as well as share knowledge and experience regionally,negative
4591,the m&e unit be under resource which limit what -PRON- be able to do -PRON- ability to become more result and impact orient and to influence and inform programme team,negative
4592,a strategic review of the m&e function could usefully address these issue,negative
4593,however in practice the newly collect agricultural datum often remain within the control of the ministry of agriculture and be insufficiently share with economic actor and customer,negative
4594,fao may consider draw from the good practice of two successful case in the region guyana and trinidad and tobago,negative
4595,however in spite of a few very positive example the technical assistance in this area be insufficiently build upon and aggregate over time make -PRON- difficult to achieve a lasting impact,negative
4596,whereas the case of citrus greening in dominica highlight the importance of build capacity in pest management over the long term fao have lack a consistent strategy to address plant health in the region and to monitor emerge and more traditional threat,negative
4597,there be also limited fao programmatic engagement on these issue apart from two case in dominica and antigua and barbuda detail in the report,negative
4598,the limited attention pay to these sector seem to reflect the low priority accord to -PRON- at the country level,negative
4599,while fao have attract a grow amount of extra budgetary funding for grfa activities these voluntary contribution have not increase proportionately with the volume of work,negative
4600,review strategic framework seem to accord low priority to grfa work14,negative
4601,however in one locality baki somaliland challenge relate to market access result in producer incur high transport cost and high perishability risk,negative
4602,similarly in the village of beer and owdweyne somaliland a number of respondent complain that wfp food distribution constrain -PRON- ability to obtain well price for -PRON- cereal at market,negative
4603,respondent indicate that -PRON- typically stop sell -PRON- surplus production during these period as market price be unfavourable,negative
4604,many respondent explain that fpmis continue to be too cumbersome for the need of the programme approach,negative
4605,another reason for this may be that the team be now use to -PRON- parallel system and have no incentive to move to fpmis,negative
4606,in any case this indicate a continued inability of the country office to manage a programme approach solely through fpmi,negative
4607,to date this have yet to be prove,negative
4608,each agency keep work on -PRON- agency specific programme use -PRON- own funding and administration mechanism,negative
4609,while this may indeed build ngo capacity the long term impact and result be unclear,negative
4610,while fao somalia have put in place a new risk management framework which be develop to ensure high level of accountability and more rigorous check and balance there do not appear to be a consistent plan or criterion for work with implement partner specifically for capacity development,negative
4611,question can also be raise in relation to the sustainability of benefit of cfw intervention on community asset although field assessment indicate much appreciation for the training offer on how to manage and maintain the infrastructure construct or rehabilitate through cfw,negative
4612,feeder road canal and water catchment which be the focus of cfw project in the area under analysis be asset that require continuous maintenance,negative
4613,with regard to the choice of transfer modality no documentation be find outline the rationale and decision make process underpin the choice make by fao and wfp to implement cfw and ffw activity respectively,negative
4614,this appear to be a gap since the decision to implement cfw and ffw should be premise on robust market base evidence,negative
4615,many of the corporate tool require to implement under a programme approach do not exist yet,negative
4616,in somalia the jrs try to break down technical silo but the organogram of the fao country office be still structure around team with technical speciality as oppose to programmatic outcome,negative
4617,some sector remain territorial over project activity and funding while other be clearly collaborate more,negative
4618,the lack of a joint beneficiary database or other mechanism e.g. joint planning feeding into programme and field level coordination among agency that allow for assurance that all household receive the input from each agency make -PRON- impossible for the claim to be prove,negative
4619,since the development of the jrs an increase in resilience focus consortia combine with a change in leadership at all three agency have coincide with decrease funding cause additional challenge and potentially lower the motivation of leadership and implementation team in the jrs,negative
4620,engagement with somali community by management and nairobi level staff be constrain by the security situation and link programme design decision making to ccap and seasonal calendar remain challenging,negative
4621,there also remain a lack of familiarity and trust in rima among some partner,negative
4622,fao must be careful not to forge ahead without respond to challenge as this may further erode confidence,negative
4623,-PRON- be evident that the majority of the identify issue be common to the boblme country rather than strictly transboundary -PRON- do not necessitate all the bay of bengal country act together to address -PRON-,negative
4624,a more effective approach for the project and the tda sap would have be to identify the most practicable opportunity in single location and country for testing and demonstrate potential solution,negative
4625,the evaluation conclude that policy work should have be integrate with the work on management strategy e.g. icm critical habitat mpa fishery,negative
4626,the policy review have make -PRON- clear that implementation and enforcement be major weakness yet little if anything be do to demonstrate effective way of improve implementation and enforcement through country level pilot,negative
4627,this have hinder the due appropriation of the project,negative
4628,sometimes the attribution of the project and -PRON- partner be unclear partially due to the limited identity of the project,negative
4629,less progress be make on investment case and this plan output be remove from the priority in view of other initiative such as cost of hunger profile,negative
4630,this imply miss opportunity to leverage resource for nutrition priority as originally envisage,negative
4631,however plan in all eight case remain unimplemented because funding be lack,negative
4632,in two country institutional limitation preclude progress towards this outcome,negative
4633,along with other partner the initiative contribute to significant enhancement in institutional capacity although sustainability can not be guarantee,negative
4634,however there be no clear agreement among global stakeholder regard whether reach should focus purely on mobilize partner to provide technical input or play a direct role in address capacity gap,negative
4635,country- level stakeholder have differ opinion as to whether reach should or could have a coordinate function among united nations agency,negative
4636,progress be strongly affect by the willingness of united nations agency to collaborate at the country level,negative
4637,progress towards this outcome be uneven and depend on local institutional factor and the personality of country head of united nations agency,negative
4638,there be some loss in programming efficiency because of delay in the placement of reach facilitator in all country,negative
4639,as a result preliminary datum be often out of date and in bangladesh ghana mozambique rwanda and the united republic of tanzania some of the people involve in formulate cip have move on,negative
4640,there have be insufficient attention to the effect on the sun movement when reach end,negative
4641,in addition country exit strategy be premature in relation to progress and be develop late in the process,negative
4642,the capacity to deliver empre component continue to be reduce and be insufficient to meet demand,negative
4643,this be couple with the suboptimal use of exist capacity,negative
4644,however in south sudan the food security information gap remain vast,negative
4645,in such condition ipc analysis on -PRON- own be not enough,negative
4646,a full time gender expert should be hire if that be not possible in the short term the slc should provide guidance at the subregional level,negative
4647,at the country level gender should be view as an economic issue while man should be include in outreach strategy woman must be encourage to pursue new opportunity in the agricultural sector,negative
4648,most of -PRON- be promote through regional project which be often develop with only limited input from the country office,negative
4649,as a result the relevance expect outcome and benefit of the project be often not adequately understand and align with the priority of the country,negative
4650,however there be room for further strengthening of partnership particularly those just begin with civil society and the private sector,negative
4651,to date a common strategic discussion between staff at regional and country level over the good kind of partnership for the country have not take place,negative
4652,staff have not be systematically brief or train on the topic and what be aim to be achieve in this aspect be unclear,negative
4653,even when research have produce relevant finding on gender in lao -PRON- have not be disseminate or apply to implementation,negative
4654,there be too many project that be too small and this affected efficiency and potentially wide impact,negative
4655,project design be not base on a strong contextual understanding and lack a theory of change and though logical framework be use systematically at time -PRON- quality be low,negative
4656,the design of some project and activity be not inform by a strong understanding of the context and lack a corresponding theory of change to bring about long term more significant change,negative
4657,beneficiary targeting be rarely adequate and initial need assessment be often carry out too rapidly at field level,negative
4658,in the case of enaf a large proportion of the delay come as a consequence of the delay face by enact,negative
4659,the lack of a tailor monitoring framework for the project make -PRON- difficult to closely monitor the implementation and identify measure to avoid delay,negative
4660,at a number of point -PRON- have emerge that ilo constituent at national level often lack capacity sometimes interest in the area of extend the social protection floor,negative
4661,ilo visibility continue to be low than -PRON- should be,negative
4662,internally this will probably involve introduce change to the current configuration of technical support in the various programme link -PRON- to employment policy development with the aim of improve the coherence of ilo policy message at country level,negative
4663,in addition this evaluation also point to the likelihood of additional efficiency be realize through such a rationalization process,negative
4664,repeat assistance to country under the same outcome indicator and country programme activity under overlap outcome indicator do not adequately reflect the support and progress be make within the broad policy cycle,negative
4665,the monitoring of underlie efficiency difference in nep process in different country miss a define scope or set of minimum quality standard for nep formulation,negative
4666,field employment specialist be not distribute consistently enough to support current and future pipeline nep support target country,negative
4667,africa base support in particular appear under supply,negative
4668,this be partly due to national budgetary constraint and internal government coordination issue,negative
4669,tool and service for these phase within the ilo strategy have only recently be define,negative
4670,country case study show that this be not automatic and situation can arise where specific group end up in disadvantageous situation,negative
4671,more attention will need to be pay to this,negative
4672,on the other hand the programme have in several instance work at arm length with some of the department concern,negative
4673,there have be an imperfect meeting of mind within the ilo about which datum to collect and the confidence to place in the ses analysis on how to collect datum and on the analysis and interpretation of that datum,negative
4674,for example a flagship publication7 put out in september 2004 be issue as a ses product rather than an ilo endorse set of policy however with little clarity as to why this distinction be be make,negative
4675,the publication pose challenge to the office in handle how to distinguish between what be publish work that be exploratory and innovative but that do not represent ilo policy position,negative
4676,have -PRON- be review with the latter more in mind -PRON- could have convert what be basically an important report raise serious issue into one that the ilo could safely share with the inter governmental process,negative
4677,however some aspect of design could be improve primarily with respect to the scope of engagement and sequence of activity,negative
4678,sometimes insufficient attention be pay to the nature magnitude and institutionalization of training for labour inspector the design of sanction and associate administrative and judi- cial procedure and the development of comprehensive strategy and operating plan for labour inspectorate,negative
4679,from a broad institutional perspective while the office have establish planning and control system some deficiency be apparent,negative
4680,these include functional limitation in the integrated resource information system iris the lack of inte- gration of planning reporting and financial system and the absence of a mechanism to inde- pendently validate report result,negative
4681,well define outcome and indicator be need to ensure accountability and provide a basis for continuous improvement,negative
4682,while ilo seek to support member state in keep with international standard as reflect in convention nos,negative
4683,achieve great compliance with applicable law and regulation be dependent on numerous social political and economic factor -PRON- require action across multiple front,negative
4684,however this be where the implementation of il outside the formal sector must make progress if -PRON- be to benefit a large proportion of the population,negative
4685,at this stage without substantial extra fund the office can do little more than monitor and take on board good practice lesson from -PRON- own experience,negative
4686,one must recognize that the resource of the office be not sufficient for all of the mandate and action -PRON- be request to assume,negative
4687,progress by consensus be always rather slow and there be some good sign that all party appreciate the need for reform,negative
4688,however as long as the fprw outcome be mirror in separate organizational unit the 2008 declaration 's policy call for synergy be the only overriding incentive for manager to blend and combine outcome link regular budget rb financing,negative
4689,similar constraint do not exist for the use of extra budgetary resource with various project combine the principle within one project framework,negative
4690,these vary in depth and scope from project to project,negative
4691,there be no comprehensive strategy for mainstreame fprw into all of the office 's work despite the policy mandate in the 2008 declaration,negative
4692,however a common strategy for all sector of the office aim at achieve the long term objective of the resolution have not be develop,negative
4693,such a strategy could have be of great use to the office in realize -PRON- commitment to result base management,negative
4694,to this end planning of specific activity for the implementation of the overall strategy or the sub strategy would be need,negative
4695,a detailed strategy would reinforce the spirit of the conclusion draw in the ilc resolution in 2004 and -PRON- call for a plan of action that take into account the established element,negative
4696,still there be a number of interview response state that ilo have lose a significant amount of ground in osh relate global issue,negative
4697,the reason the interviewee give be the activity of other similarly orient international organization the minimal agreement between many constituent which prohibit the ilo play a more advanced role in osh a lack of collaboration between ilo and other global organization and miss opportunity to promote osh to donor organization,negative
4698,consequently the formerly undisputed position of ilo as a global leader in osh relate issue and osh standard setting be likely to become increasingly vulnerable,negative
4699,-PRON- be the only un system organization to follow this pattern,negative
4700,the location convey an impression of lack of independence,negative
4701,however there be little effective connection between evaluation and result base management within the office,negative
4702,self evaluation at the programme level be not as well develop as would be hope although a number of exercise show promise,negative
4703,there have be train initiative but the result have be uneven and there be an express need for additional training at all level include for stakeholder,negative
4704,while there have be an effort to engage stakeholder in a participatory process in evaluation this have not always be consider satisfactory,negative
4705,a second issue be the nature and unpredictability of exis- te donor funding for social protection which often result in rather small short project that be not conducive to support long term process of change,negative
4706,finally in the absence of comprehensive capaci- ty build strategy and systematic monitoring of progress combine with high level of staff turnover in key ministry gain make in build local social protection capacity be under threat,negative
4707,the low level of coherence be find in country that do not have formal ilo representation,negative
4708,here project team tend to run -PRON- project separately and there be less systematic coherence and coordination,negative
4709,in none of the case review be the dwcps cost and anchor in budget,negative
4710,as a result -PRON- be somewhat theoretical and unless cost can not be the basis for realistic result base management rbm,negative
4711,these be mostly associate with delay in recruitment or procurement,negative
4712,some ilo tc project personnel in country lack a country representative be strongly critical of the difficulty -PRON- face because of -PRON- lack of authority over recruitment procurement and financial management,negative
4713,this have prove particularly challenge in instance where -PRON- manager base in other office be unavailable for long period of time and have fail to nominate temporary replacement,negative
4714,this result in infrequent or insufficient field mission particularly with regard to country portfolio and policy development and result in miss opportunity,negative
4715,-PRON- be for pro- gramme staff to develop relationship of trust and conduct a sustained policy dialogue under such condi- tion,negative
4716,furthermore some project personnel perform representational and administrative support function beyond -PRON- core responsibility in country without country director cut into -PRON- core project management responsibility,negative
4717,coordination activity by yep to support internal coherence and complementarity have be hinder by -PRON- limited empowerment and lack of dedicated human resource,negative
4718,this be a major constraint in try to technically anchor the large and grow portfolio of project people and agency involve in ilo youth employment initiative,negative
4719,the degree of youth employment coordination among various ministry government agency and the social partner have be report as generally low for many of the country where the ilo be work on youth employment,negative
4720,there be often conflict priority across ministry which deter effort to integrate approach within the public sector,negative
4721,a more strategic and result orient approach to decision making on national intervention could contribute to increase effectiveness and target specialized need i.e. enlarged network of stakeholder disadvantaged youth group,negative
4722,the multi faceted character of intervention require multi disciplinary approach and this be why youth employment initiative be normally multi departmental,negative
4723,the youth employment programme be an important ilo resource to generate integration and coordination of intervention but -PRON- lack adequate dedicated resource and an administrative presence to create and manage a complex internal partnership arrangement,negative
4724,as the lead technical un agency the ilo will have to develop not only the expertise but also the organizational and management system to reduce the high transaction cost associate with multi agency process,negative
4725,a specific responsibility and set of tool be need to do this in the office which would enable yep to well coordinate within -PRON- limited capacity,negative
4726,on the negative side the number of ilo project that include gender equality in outcome output and activity have decrease over the action plan period,negative
4727,nearly three quarter of project be classify with no or only few objective outcome output or activity to promote gender equality,negative
4728,gender equality can sometimes be view as optional in technical cooperation or dwcps i.e. proposal be not reject if gender equality be not address,negative
4729,nearly three quarter of project be classify with no or only few objective outcome output or activity to promote gender equality,negative
4730,gender equality can sometimes be view as optional in technical cooperation or dwcps i.e. proposal be not reject if gender equality be not address,negative
4731,apart from appraise dwcp document and plan technical cooperation project what the implementation of ilo initiative matter,negative
4732,however give that in opera- tional term ilo be not a humanitarian agency -PRON- have often play a secondary role in the humanitarian field,negative
4733,this have frequently result in the marginalization of topic relate to employment and social dia- logue in reconstruction plan reduction in the amount of fund allocate to the topic cover by the ilo insufficient involvement of the social partner in set out strategy and reconstruction plan recovery and development and exclusion of ilo from the overall rebuilding process,negative
4734,however there be still some way to go before initiative address gender as a force for change in development,negative
4735,in a number of intervention the participation of woman be nominal especially in some of the more male dominate society,negative
4736,as highlight in a number of evaluation for example in africa the americas and the caucasus region obstacle and barrier be particularly strong in area which have experience civil strife or faced transition to democracy,negative
4737,such country often have only a weak social fabric and be characterize by other challenge e.g. fragmentation within social partner organization,negative
4738,the need to have long term commitment and a more incremental approach to achieve positive outcome and sustainability be recommend in many report relate to capacity building and sound industrial relation include non ilo intervention such as in the eu particularly in country where social dialogue and tripartism be face substantial barrier,negative
4739,in the context of labour law and labour administration evaluation highlight the insufficiency of ilo capacities both at headquarters and in the field as a crucial barrier to achieve well result,negative
4740,risks external factor that can disturb or destroy an intervention be often not consider or if -PRON- be then in overly optimistic way,negative
4741,the lead time to start up a project or other plan activity be typically underestimate often lead to long delay and serious problem to arrive at completion or even complete failure to deliver useful result,negative
4742,the sfp have a special responsibility to deal with the apparent limited knowledge of sf in many tc project and country office as well as perception by some that social finance be a headquarters project,negative
4743,the social finance network have play less of an integrate role than anticipate,negative
4744,this reflect the knowledge and understanding of social finance at the field level which be still too dependent on the professional background and interest of individual ilo staff member,negative
4745,the social finance concept have not yet sufficiently penetrate the ilo structure,negative
4746,-PRON- be a challenging task to move beyond assess the achievement of individual project to assess the achievement in term of dwcp outcome,negative
4747,to be able to do so the dwcp evaluation framework need to be think through when the dwcp be be design,negative
4748,the use of annual progress and final report to the donor and programme implementation report do not allow for critical and comprehensive analysis of result achieve nor the identification of opportunity and challenge,negative
4749,this limit the scope for improvement and discussion around possible synergy,negative
4750,many of the challenge relate to a lack of dedicated staff to this project coordinate across unit at headquarters as well as budget and co financing requirement,negative
4751,management of the project often rely on the good will of country office,negative
4752,however ensure that w4y be relevant as a discernible input into policy programme or dialogue prove to be very challenging,negative
4753,the team find few instance where stakeholder see the swts as an important input into the major government policy and program initiative to youth employment,negative
4754,while ilo and mcf have utilize and disseminate swts information there have to date be limit use of the swts microdata swts report and the youthpol database among global stakeholder,negative
4755,the potential value or impact of the investment in assemble this global repository of detailed information will diminish over time unless there be additional effort to gather comparable information in more county gather comparable information in country over time and expand the user base for the information,negative
4756,although gender issue have be identify in the code of practice recommendation 200 and other ilo document the ilo strategy on gender and hiv in the world of work be still not very strong,negative
4757,isolated effort have be undertake but gender need to be more solidly and explicitly integrate across hiv in the world of work programming,negative
4758,monitoring tool and process have not be sufficiently tailor to the need of project implementer,negative
4759,the project do not integrate gender equality related objective in the logframe at the design stage of the project,negative
4760,-PRON- also do not provide guidance on promote cross fertilization and collaboration with other outcome,negative
4761,the dwcps be the most effective vehicle for deliver ilo support to member state,negative
4762,the employment intensive construction method be disadvantage by long hold national and international concern about the management intensity for government institution and -PRON- contractor and perceive risk link to the relatively slow disbursement of fund,negative
4763,in some country there be perception of the methodology be donor drive rather than nationally own,negative
4764,finally corruption remain a major problem within infrastructure investment and there be some resistance to the increase transparency associate with these method particularly give the range of eiis management tool for effective management and local governance,negative
4765,there be wide disparity in the number of country cover by each regional office ro decent work technical support team dwt and by each country office co as well as in the office architecture,negative
4766,constituent staff and donor express concern that the office serve a large number of country be unreasonably overstretched,negative
4767,there do not appear to be a systematic process for determine demand at country or regional level although the process of develop dwcps partly serve this purpose,negative
4768,whene- ver new technical need emerge the lack of agility or flexibility in the biennial budgetary and program- ming process and lengthy recruitment and mobility process inhibit responsiveness,negative
4769,this be a major factor in determine whether or not the ilo be an effective partner in all unct,negative
4770,dispa- rity in the number of country cover by office in the field need to be address to ensure quality and equitable delivery of service,negative
4771,this be in part explain by the fact that the implementation of the mcof at these level do not always imply additional allocation of resource,negative
4772,however as the mcof be a tool for foster improved internal coordination and programmatic coherence at all level a strengthening of the internal coordination mechanism and the allocation of resource on a consistent and ongoing basis be require for undertake comprehensive assessment and develop response strategy at different stage of a crisis with mobility dimension include in anticipation of or in the wake of a crisis situation,negative
4773,the report note however that with the expansion of the facility the number of project to review comment on and submit to the iom director general for approval have be increase,negative
4774,furthermore the improved management through the creation of two database that require constant monitoring information share with iom member state and the monitoring of information exchange with iom mission on project endorsement and implementation have put pressure on the two iom staff in charge of the facility,negative
4775,further inclusion of other project stakeholder such as formal partner or associate could also have increase the capacity development in the medium term of government civil society diaspora group and other main actor,negative
4776,the steering committee meeting composition and responsibility should have be set out during the inception meeting and review during implementation,negative
4777,the benefit to the direct beneficiary i.e. migrant would have have the most relevance to objective 4 improve remittance transfer service and provide remittance transfer through formal financial institution,negative
4778,this component could have benefit from further expansion and replication among migrant -PRON-,negative
4779,apart from neighbourhood opposition the municipal and national election and the referendum a difficult economic situation in the country additionally prolong the efficient open centre set up,negative
4780,capital control follow the parliamentary election in september 2015 disrupt procurement contracting and refurbishing procedure,negative
4781,at headquart level the private sector liaison team in the donor relations department drd remain small with the head also have other donor liaison function,negative
4782,overall there be limited dedicated human resource for private sector and most of the interviewee consider -PRON- to be inadequate particularly for an organization that be highly dependent on fundraise and voluntary contribution,negative
4783,there be however other effort such as knowledge management which be not implement due mostly to lack of human and financial resource put sustainability effort at risk,negative
4784,the lack of commitment for predictable funding be a major obstacle to both ensure outcome be meet and that -PRON- become sustainable,negative
4785,no 12 be also await since november 2017 due to the donor consider new funding and an extension until the end of 2018 allow the implementation of additional activity,negative
4786,the modification of the cooperative agreement be finalize in may 2018,negative
4787,one of the main reason for the difficulty in obtain reimbursement be the lack of interest of iom donor in reimburse amount use for evacuation which represent 71 per cent of the fund to be repay as at 31 december 2015,negative
4788,another reason be the reluctance of donor to use -PRON- contribution for retroactive reimbursement of operation fund by mefm,negative
4789,the area which require some improvement be those related to the implementation of the community plan and ensure that proper responsibility and monitoring be conduct to track the plan,negative
4790,base on focus group discussion some community highlight that -PRON- expectation be not meet and that -PRON- be not align with what iom have intend to provide,negative
4791,the further breakdown and single counting still do not allow for insight into the scale of the adoption of change or the implementation of agree action,negative
4792,the new indicator set focusse more on the implementation phase outcome as oppose to a mix of adoption and implementation in the old set,negative
4793,a connected issue be the tension between the normative role un environment programme as a whole be design to play and the operational role -PRON- have in practice,negative
4794,because of the normative focus any substantive change that be achieve in practice may go unreported,negative
4795,this criterion include consideration of partner and stakeholder engagement in the period between project approval and mobilisation,negative
4796,the issue of stakeholder participation could be more closely associate with a weak demand drive approach than during actual project implementation,negative
4797,as a result the project enter into the project information management system often do not entirely match the work deliver or be deliver via multiple often separate donor- funded project,negative
4798,the existence of more than one set of project result one review and approve internally and another form a commitment to a donor pose challenge for accountability and weaken the potential for the demonstration of performance,negative
4799,the first be the question of prioritisation of activity as a means to limit the effect of funding shortfall on pow delivery,negative
4800,while simple prioritisation of activity would certainly guide allocation of mtf resource and fundraising activity in the short term view remain polarised regard the wide question of the scope of work and whether this should be tailor to available resource,negative
4801,the second be the question of how to improve the ratio between administrative and programme cost,negative
4802,mechanism for gender mainstreaming have be put in place in some of the core area of unep work but these be not yet robust enough to ensure compliance and a meaningful integration of gender perspective into operational or programmatic area of work,negative
4803,the low level of resource allocation from core fund and external fund mobilization low awareness level of staff regard the gepa insufficient commitment by management and staff to promote meaningful gender mainstreaming and inadequate mechanism for ensure result suggest that gender mainstreaming in unep be not yet sustainable,negative
4804,the implementation of the gepa have be weaken by a number of constraint,negative
4805,some of these weakness be strategic and can be trace back to the very core of the unep gender equality mandate and the strategy -PRON- have adopt to operationalize this mandate,negative
4806,other weakness be more operational and relate more to institutional arrangement and implement mechanism adapt to support gender mainstreaming institutionally and operationally,negative
4807,the context be unclear there be no statement as to how gender equality and equity should be understand in unep and how -PRON- apply to unep work,negative
4808,there be also no vision statement to create an institutional value and a sense of direction and opportunity for gender equality and equity,negative
4809,hence many gfp be inactive,negative
4810,the role of the sga gender coordinator and gfp also need to be revisit,negative
4811,the gepa have not consistently indicate expect outcome and output of these partnership,negative
4812,and unep partnership policy have not define the framework for engagement of partner on gender and environmental issue,negative
4813,but unep be have difficulty in successfully demonstrate -PRON- contribution to this endeavour,negative
4814,unep project be unable to demonstrate -PRON- contribution to promote gender equality mainly due to lack of substantive gender consideration in the project design and implementation lack of sex disaggregate and gender specific information in monitoring and reporting and lack of attention to gender dimension in unep evaluation,negative
4815,this lack of authority can impede spc from get access to progress information from other division limit -PRON- ability to influence project and programme design process and constrain -PRON- influence on resource allocation decision to pursue alignment with subprogramme priority,negative
4816,-PRON- ability to ensure that action be take to mitigate corporate risk to subprogramme implementation be also weak especially when action be require beyond the lead division,negative
4817,spc currently lack access to budgetary resource to perform coordination duty unless -PRON- happen to hold other substantive responsibility that can afford -PRON- some flexibility in this regard,negative
4818,-PRON- would seem that the resource allocation trend associate with the former divisional structure prior to 2010 have be use to guide allocation of the environment fund,negative
4819,relative priority across thematic subprogramme expect accomplishment and pow output be difficult to discern and lack any write justification,negative
4820,qas do provide project document template and useful feedback on draft project design document,negative
4821,qas also facilitate an important project review process to raise quality at entry,negative
4822,however there be no up to date programme manual to serve as a reference to project designer and training for staff involve in project design be find inadequate,negative
4823,these factor may all have contribute to the high heterogeneity in the quality of the project design document review by this evaluation,negative
4824,in a few case milestone refer to external event which would have happen anyway,negative
4825,improvement in the articulation of project milestone to well capture the intended project causality couple with monitoring of the achievement of project milestone schedule in any give reporting period would yield a robust and objectively verifiable reporting approach that would be easily incorporate into the approach use in current ppr process,negative
4826,a lack of detail in project document on stakeholder often go hand in hand with poorly articulate outreach and dissemination strategy,negative
4827,-PRON- be also important to note that project design often articulate the intent to hire new staff for constitute the project management team instead of rely on staff available in partner institution,negative
4828,at the time of project approval a significant number of project have mobilize none or very small proportion of the require project fund,negative
4829,the single most important deficiency be the absence of any quantification of environment fund financial or staff resource that will be require for project implementation,negative
4830,this deficiency be because the un accounting systems imis can not handle allocate environment fund ef resource to project,negative
4831,the idea of allocate ef in project be part of the original plan but have to be abandon,negative
4832,replication of project result be most often expect to happen simply through communication and awareness raising website policy brief lesson learn paper etc,negative
4833,those activity be in most case poorly spell out and insufficiently resource for replication to stand a good chance of success,negative
4834,most project design lack adequate baseline and very few specify activity to establish baseline and conduct recurrent monitoring,negative
4835,milestone that capture progress to high result level be usually miss,negative
4836,the narrative description and logframe present in the project document frequently make no mention of the activity that be list as csfs,negative
4837,sometimes important risk be present as critical success factor and vice versa,negative
4838,approve pow project lack adequate detail on the strategy to be employ to sustain project outcome,negative
4839,exit strategy be either ignore or implicit and this be a serious shortcoming,negative
4840,however the evaluation find that in comparison to some other un agency unep struggle to fully embrace operate under one un at the country level,negative
4841,the track record of relevance to united nations development assistance framework undaf be inconsistent and be highly dependent on the individual in regional office and relationship with relevant government and un counterpart see recommendation 9,negative
4842,there do not appear to be a clear approach on engagement with particular country nor a coherent strategy for identify potential new partner country nor a great attention for possible synergy at the regional level,negative
4843,country be target by donor and aid agency under -PRON- respective strategy and programme of work adb world bank eu bilateral etc and therefore even though request come from the country or regional office funding be only make available through a process of coordination between country unep and the respective donor,negative
4844,in addition project miss opportunity to reorient and well focus on achieve intend change by not regularly incorporate assumption and driver into planning and implementation,negative
4845,there be typically no risk management process or system in place for unep project,negative
4846,however stakeholder involvement especially at the country level could be strong during the design stage of project,negative
4847,this be often limited due to budget constraint at the project design stage,negative
4848,umbrella project do not present a theory of change explain the coherence between -PRON- sub project and sub project result be difficult to identify and track for the purpose of learning and accountability,negative
4849,output milestone and target develop for the umbrella project be quite meaningless for monitor progress at the level of the individual sub project,negative
4850,-PRON- have be decide in unep discourage the submission of umbrella project from 2014 onwards,negative
4851,in order to support the geographically disperse effort when the ccsp be first launch climate change expert be place in each of the regional office,negative
4852,however to date not all ro retain these regional cc coordinator and other regional office staff sometimes step in for ccsp coordination with technical support from project staff,negative
4853,dtie as the lead division make the final budgetary decision,negative
4854,there be a strong perception that dtie abuse -PRON- budget control to acquire a relatively large amount of environment fund financing for -PRON- project,negative
4855,the evaluation be unable to find evidence that this be really the case but this perception of unfairness create mistrust and disincentive for collaboration,negative
4856,dtie have the responsibility of coordination and allocation of funding for the ccsp but without an accountability mechanism,negative
4857,staff report that -PRON- manage the lack of clear authority by know how to navigate the system in place and meet administrative requirement,negative
4858,some team expect to be budget under the ccsp between 2010 13 end up assign with responsibility for only a minimal activity budget,negative
4859,those team be incentivize to find other mean to create financial leeway or leverage external resource when possible and also to take cost save measure but this also lead to a prioritization of engagement with partner who can provide funding or other form of cost saving,negative
4860,the ccsp as a whole be chronically stifle by staff shortage largely due to vacancy that remain open due to the slow recruitment process,negative
4861,as many global programme reach period of expansion so too will technical assistance demand increase as new country begin implementation,negative
4862,staff shortage mean unep can not be in regular attendance at all key political meeting and be sometimes unable to embrace important opportunity to strategize or form collaborative relationship with new partner,negative
4863,also the lack of staff fund by reliable source both extra budgetary funding and environment fund funding appear unreliable have mean relatively high rate of fluctuation of team size and turnover in some unit many of whom have lose more than half -PRON- original number since 2010,negative
4864,these dramatic change also impede retention of institutional knowledge,negative
4865,unep claim to have insufficient resource to open sub regional office,negative
4866,the few unep country office china tanzania though play a very important role be also very small with no more than about four staff include intern to coordinate activity at the country level,negative
4867,in some case funding constraint make -PRON- impossible to conduct the plan field demonstration and to provide follow up after train course,negative
4868,the prevalence of unsecured fund force manager to take a phase implementation approach where activity would start at a small scale while further funding be be mobilize,negative
4869,for mitigation project unsecured fund also remain an issue even if -PRON- do not cause major blockage recently with the exception of project with several phase for which fund be not available in advance,negative
4870,the overall administrative burden in particular the long lead time to get contract out be an area of concern,negative
4871,also establish durable relationship between unep and external partner be a challenge when base on a sequence of contract or project rather than some long term mou and a continue funding base since there be little institutional continuity or incentive to continue collaboration,negative
4872,publicly available output assessment guideline etc can be find online but information on -PRON- utility and use be non existent,negative
4873,most donor require at least annual submission of substantive and financial report associate with the fund that -PRON- have provide but -PRON- appear that report to donor be not systematically archive either in pim or in any other share database,negative
4874,unep can only provide the good possible product and service target those to the most appropriate people in the most appropriate format,negative
4875,attribution be a major issue and require an evaluative approach,negative
4876,those ea be therefore not appropriate for monitor uneps performance in the course of pow implementation,negative
4877,most ea incorporate the strategy or mean basically the output by which unep intend to achieve or contribute to -PRON-,negative
4878,the indicator and unit of measurement be then often indicate the delivery of these output rather than the extent to which the ea have be achieve,negative
4879,other indicator be incomplete and do not indicate the full extent of achievement of the ea,negative
4880,both pim and pprs however seem to have a have a strong positive reporting bias only achievement be report not failure,negative
4881,m&e,negative
4882,unep intend to provide in the pf document,negative
4883,each pf document present a narrative of a theory of change for the sub- programme describe how unep pow output be expect to contribute to outcome and how these outcome be expect to lead to impact on the environment and human well being pass through one or more intermediate state,negative
4884,f document also mention the main target group of the sub programme but -PRON- role or how and why -PRON- would be affect by change promote by the sub programme be not explain,negative
4885,toc narrative be very vague about the stakeholder that can affect or can be affect by change along the causal pathway,negative
4886,neither do -PRON- articulate sub programme wide role and responsibility of unep division branch and unit,negative
4887,with only one exception eco system management pf document also do not describe an overall steering mechanism for the sub programme,negative
4888,however the key output relate to the gpwm accomplish little,negative
4889,the key driver for the delivery of the output in term of human and financial resource be not in place,negative
4890,without the delivery of the key output which will form the framework within which to assist government to work towards the sound management of waste -PRON- be unclear to this evaluation how outcome can be achieve in the medium term,negative
4891,-PRON- be quite clear from interview with staff that considerable pre packaging of old activity to fit the expected accomplishment define in the mts occur,negative
4892,the internal logic in the 2010 11 and 2012 13pow seem flaw in some respect,negative
4893,the current 2014 15pow be not any easy to understand conceptually and the linkage to the high level result be not altogether clear,negative
4894,eas have be reformulate and there be considerable rearrangement of pow output under the three new eas,negative
4895,in addition there seem to be a lack of understanding among some staff on the thinking behind sub programme design and how -PRON- project and intervention fit within the sub programme architecture and for that matter the unep pow because there be little to no participation by programme officer in sub programme design,negative
4896,in fact over half of staff survey respondent report not to have be involve in the process,negative
4897,the sub- programme have consistently identify the availability of fund to be a constraint in carry out -PRON- capacity building activity,negative
4898,this have result in diminished capacity to implement some key secretariat function such as the servicing of -PRON- information clearing house preparation for major meeting and processing of qsp project,negative
4899,the evaluation find that the c&w sub programme do not have a coherent resource mobilization strategy,negative
4900,reporting especially at the expect accomplishment level be not base on milestone and do not reflect progress be make by the sub programme towards eas,negative
4901,report at the project level be lax,negative
4902,progress report for individual project especially on waste be not easily find and where -PRON- exist the report often describe progress on activity and output only high level result be hardly ever report on,negative
4903,report on the sub programme through imdi remain biannual and undertake on a routine basis,negative
4904,since 2010 quarterly progress report on project in pim have also be undertake against project milestone,negative
4905,reporting be a share responsibility between the project manager and the sub programme coordinator,negative
4906,programme performance report on the other hand be coordinate by the sub programme coordinator and be focus primarily on success,negative
4907,milestone in most of the project seem adequate for measure implementation progress,negative
4908,resource for the most part be allocate for reporting and evaluation which seem adequate,negative
4909,with little to no baseline information poorly formulate expect accomplishment indicator problem with attribution and the lack of budget for project monitoring the task of monitor accomplishment become a difficult one,negative
4910,generally the project do not include baseline study mainly because there be no funding for project design,negative
4911,the report review for this evaluation show that sub programme performance reporting be do mostly at the output level because output monitoring be an easy task and the achievement of output become a proxy for the achievement of eas,negative
4912,development of capacity at the national level for example often mean that training activity workshop seminar meeting be organize and the successful completion of these meeting and workshop infer build capacity,negative
4913,the extent to which the workshop result in attitudinal change that will lead to action towards the sound management of chemical be generally assume,negative
4914,even obligatory completion report of a reasonable quality have not be prepared for most complete project,negative
4915,very few perhaps two of the complete project in the c&w sub programme be subject to evaluation over the past 5 year,negative
4916,the two project be actually gef project which over the previous mts period be not consider part of the unep programme of work,negative
4917,interview conduct in the branch show a trend of lack of evaluation of programme activity date far back than the evaluation period,negative
4918,-PRON- be not unreasonable to state therefore that the culture of evaluation of programme activity be quite poor and need to be improve,negative
4919,monitor at the project output level together with the lack of independent evaluative evidence make -PRON- impossible to make any meaningful judgment about progress make in implementation towards outcome and impact,negative
4920,the visibility of such corporate work both in term of report performance and as a clear locus for resource allocation be also affect,negative
4921,cross cut corporate support service should not reside within thematic sub programme,negative
4922,this further undermine result base design principle,negative
4923,for example the delc manage abc project be say to respond to 2010 11 pow output 411 414 and 443,negative
4924,for example within the hs hw sub- programme the support to draft an mea on mercury although not formally a part of the egsp be substantively support by -PRON-,negative
4925,such linkage however can lead to a lack of clarity on how to approach environmental governance in operational term as reflect by discussion between delc dewa and dtie over the lead role in black carbon activity,negative
4926,there be a clear need to well define role and responsibility for governance work where -PRON- overlap with other thematically focus sps cc -PRON- hs&hw d&c and re,negative
4927,assessment of cost- effectiveness at high programmatic level be severely constrain by this,negative
4928,initiative by qas to associate all subprogram staff cost with approve project within the pow will help clarify actual resource allocation sub programme workplan should be routinely triangulate with divisional workplan,negative
4929,the current monitoring system remain a self assessment,negative
4930,internal quality assurance process to check the validity of datum be limited,negative
4931,imdis and pprs be acknowledge to have particular limitation in the amount of information that can be capture in -PRON- which force staff to be selective in choose which activity to include when report,negative
4932,this ad hoc selectivity where a different set of activity may be reflect from one reporting period to the next add to inconsistency in report progress,negative
4933,there be a need for well integration of environmental consideration in disaster risk reduction drr approach and vice versa and well preparedness for industrial accident,negative
4934,finally -PRON- be necessary to well integrate risk and opportunity from natural resource and the environment in peacebuilde strategy,negative
4935,-PRON- be hard to see an overall programme logic emerge from the project document except in very broad term,negative
4936,causal or other linkage between programme component have not be thoroughly ponder and synergy and complementarity between the different component be poorly explain,negative
4937,in addition because of the specific format of the unep prodoc template the level of detail for each component be usually insufficient,negative
4938,progress report for individual project be scarce and when -PRON- exist of very variable quality,negative
4939,most complete project also lack a completion report worth the name,negative
4940,rather than address a specific environmental challenge such as climate change harmful substance or disaster and conflict ecosystem management be a means to an end not an end in -PRON-,negative
4941,indeed a significant amount of the work unep undertakes through -PRON- other subprogramme be also base on and promote the ecosystem approach even if this be not explicitly state,negative
4942,even in the country where unep have already provide intensive support awareness and capacity for ecosystem management remain fragile and may need far strengthen for a considerable time to come,negative
4943,-PRON- be clear from the case study that at least some emsp project will need continued investment and commitment from unep or partner for some year for project result to become sustainable although -PRON- be often unclear how this would be achieve or who should be responsible again a reflection of the lack of an exit strategy,negative
4944,also judge from the case study some emsp project do not implement the governance structure envisage in project document such as project steer committee which have sometimes jeopardise the prospect for sustainability particularly of local result although there be exception notably the teeb,negative
4945,the lack of specific funding for stakeholder involvement at the project development phase also undermine ownership and ultimately sustainability and need to be address by unep see recommendation 12 below,negative

4953,lesson learning have be further weaken by the failure to deliver a key emsp level learning project,negative
4954,there be no real format or process to capture and formalise lesson learn and more guidance be need on this include clarity over what the purpose of these lesson be and who be suppose to learn -PRON-,negative
4955,at the same time project implement in a particular country have sometimes be design as separate intervention with few if any linkage and there be little sense of a coherent portfolio of emsp project at country level,negative
4956,interviewee emphasize that joint planning include the ros both within the emsp and with project under other unep sps would enable the emsp to well respond to country need reduce overlap and replication and strengthen the overall subprogramme structure,negative
4957,shortfall in resource mobilisation particularly affect the first biennium where many project begin without adequate funding and some with no funding at all,negative
4958,whilst the evaluation be not able to assess budget at pow output level some pow output have no associate project while other have as many as five contributing project during both biennia suggest an unbalanced distribution of funding between pow output,negative
4959,this have limit the ownership of project design although local partnership be usually develop at a later date once financing be secure,negative
4960,also the attention give to build strategic partnership to promote dissemination replication and up scaling of the result of local demonstration and pilot be sometimes insufficient,negative
4961,other type of under report include policy outcome catalyse by project but which be deliver after closure of the project and project extend into a new pow biennium or mts period whose report result at project level may contribute to early output or eas,negative
4962,while contribution of extended project be currently capture at project level on pim there be no mechanism to consolidate such contribution at the emsp level once a give pow period be complete,negative
4963,the quadrangular jurisdiction between unep hq in nairobi depi pcdmb in geneva undp khartoum and the country office be at good inefficient and in some case directly obstructive to the programme,negative
4964,-PRON- have result in some long delay in procurement and financial disbursement and associate reputational damage,negative

4976,the decision do not include a transparent analysis of underlie assumption and precondition that could have guide field office as a result appropriate strategy with clear indicator operational milestone and roadmap be not develop base on such analysis and could not be use to support the review of progress in subsequent year,negative
4977,where office develop comprehensive phase down plan there be no agree robust mechanism to monitor progress,negative
4978,the available organizational planning guidance do not provide sufficient support to the office on this issue include on what standard for protection and assistance could be agree with government,negative
4979,in practice most planning assumption do not hold up,negative
4980,by 2016 unhcr be less able to carry out protection and solution activity for person of concern directly and through partner,negative
4981,refugee feel frustrated and abandon protection risk have increase and phase down leave unhcr less able to respond to new emergency,negative
4982,some of those interview express a strong desire for a clear and timely outcome from the rsd process,negative

4997,household hand washing station be roll out across the settlement but -PRON- use appear to have be inconsistent over time and between location as per field observation,negative
4998,"key informant and report 3,4 indicate a need for more hand washing promotion particularly as the influx reduce and the response operation begin to stabilize",negative
4999,progress on latrine construction be slow down by environmental and social challenge variable partner performance and the delay roll out of agree latrine design by the wash technical working group,negative
5000,the target of less than 50 person per latrine be only achieve at the end of 2014,negative
5001,at the entry point the limited availability of hangar provide for shelter mean that transit centre be overcrowded and some refugee go without shelter,negative
5002,the rate of the refugee influx poor communication by unhcr to partner on the timing or relocation delay in plot demarcation and short term shortage of some construction material challenge the ability of the response effort to provide adequate emergency shelter on a timely basis,negative
5003,the availability of local material notably thatch grass contribute to delay in permanent shelter construction,negative
5004,however quality control of transitional shelter be inadequate and refugee participation in transitional shelter construction be low and variable,negative

5015,"between 2015 and 2017 the difference between revenue collect by gfm and those credit to -PRON- account represent a loss of usd 9,883,785",negative
5016,this be evident in the limited resource invest in manage the fleet and little ownership especially at senior management level of the importance of fleet management,negative
5017,as a result there be no consistent staffing structure in place and not enough capacity to manage the fleet in country,negative
5018,hence where -PRON- do materialize this involvement be limited hesitant and relatively slow annexe 2 and 3,negative
5019,if there be any lesson to emerge from this rapid review -PRON- be that hesitation be hazardous especially for resource a particular involvement,negative
5020,the grant be negotiate directly with the government by unhcr and lead to tension within the shelter cluster,negative
5021,in the absence of ngo partner the capacity for monitoring by un agency have be limit give the vast area of return,negative
5022,recent development in italy have show that the effectiveness of such a mechanism be to a large extent determine by the extent to which -PRON- be situate within an enable policy environment which may be shape by a range of factor largely independent of the model -PRON-,negative
5023,-PRON- effectiveness will be also be condition by the degree to which -PRON- be link to a broad administrative and legislative framework which include fair and transparent asylum procedure afford access to protection and the prospect of durable solution,negative
5024,the five case study confirm these result,negative
5025,the programme inefficiently spend -PRON- limit time and resource on repetitive planning and report each year include for the completion of the mc,negative
5026,the livelihood programme have little assurance of resource from one year to the next which limit -PRON- ability to do multi year planning this cause a sense of frustration among operation staff,negative
5027,one in five operation report that access to cash intervention or other assistance hinder poc desire to participate in livelihood,negative
5028,the et find there be a need for unhcr to assess how dependence on humanitarian assistance from unhcr or partner and -PRON- own messaging around vulnerability and durable solution contribute to poc willingness to engage in livelihood,negative
5029,unhcr have to rely on the expertise of other agency with mixed result,negative
5030,at time the ratio between regular unhcr staff member and external deployee be excessively skew towards the latter,negative

5038,to far complicate matter the recruitment of local capacity be also a challenge,negative
5039,the magnitude of the number and severity of condition be overwhelming and capacity of agency to cope be overstretch,negative
5040,month after the response have fully activate gam rate remain above emergency threshold and nutrition program performance indicator be below standard for all of 2011,negative
5041,in general there be poor coverage of programme low recovery rate extended stay and high readmission due in part to centralised service poor community outreach and uncoordinated referral system between implement partner,negative
5042,once the response begin in earnest in july 2011 the correct intervention be employ but not to a sufficient scale and inconsistent in the quality of performance,negative
5043,this be see when examine sphere standard performance indicator of key sector intervention throughout 2011 and the extremely high rate of gam in november 2011 that continue 5 month after the peak influx,negative
5044,to that end unhcr rosa need a revised relevant and coherent strategy develop follow consultation with government civil society and independent analyst,negative
5045,such a strategy should explicitly outline the overall objective and indicator of success mechanism for secure government buy in and guideline which will inform the selection of programme and partner receive unhcr support,negative
5046,the lack of such a strategy lead to be more reactive and try to do everything instead of prioritise and link different actor give -PRON- competency,negative

5053,and unhcr need to do all of this while maintain a paramount focus on protection and assistance,negative
5054,this be high charge and this be why as point out throughout this evaluation unhcr must increase -PRON- focus -PRON- use of strategy -PRON- prioritisation all while seek every opportunity for other competent actor to take the lead,negative
5055,unhcr have limit capacity to ensure that these can be apply consistently and effectively by country operation,negative
5056,operation struggle with deeply entrenched age gender and cultural issue that translate into right violation on a large scale in resource poor environment have not receive the technical support or financial resource to put in place target action on a scale require to resolve these issue,negative
5057,in practice cos may have to choose to respond to the protection risk face by one group over another,negative
5058,however staff be assess on aggregate rather than individual indicator,negative
5059,because indicator relate to agd be include within a wide set of indicator disaggregate datum will not be available on agd,negative
5060,unhcr can not therefore determine staff capacity or performance on agdm through -PRON- competency framework,negative
5061,this will make -PRON- difficult to determine if unhcr have an adequate staffing level to fulfill -PRON- current agdm action plan and also make the development of the next action plan more challenging,negative
5062,this evaluation demonstrate that there be consequence for people if the establish un architecture be not use and also damage to the credibility of the un and the humanitarian community,negative
5063,humanitarian principle may even be compromise in such situation even while recognize the importance of sovereignty,negative

5068,in the slovak republic the only unhcr staff member manage the centre on a unops contract,negative
5069,the difference in etc level staffing can not be fully justify on the basis of -PRON- capacity,negative
5070,the above have also lead to different budget and variation in ip capacity responsibility and assistance with the division of responsibility between the different actor in timisoara result in an overstretched ip with reduce capacity for counseling and other refugee orient activity,negative

5085,the programme also be able to capitalise on donor interest in improve fsn measurement in national survey,positive
5086,while the impact of the cfs on global governance be not easily assess monitor cfs policy implementation in the future as a cfs work stream should provide the need evidence base,positive
5087,the civil society mechanism csm have thus provide an essential voice of right holder in the deliberation of the cfs but in general more field level input should be encourage,positive
5088,a number of other product have real promise for scale up include mdd w adept and mosaicc,positive
5089,the resilience index measurement and analysis rima approach for measure resilience also be be test in multiple country,positive
5090,at the regional level the programme lead the integration of nutrition in national agriculture sector investment plan in the caadp process in africa and link sun nutrition multi sectoral process to national policies5,positive

5123,the renew interest in resilience represent a historic opportunity for fao which be well position to contribute to the resilience agenda,positive
5124,delimitate the domain of relevance of strategic programme 5 respective to that of other strategic programme be relatively straightforward strategic programme 5 should take the lead in country affect by severe crisis while other strategic programme should be more prominent in institutionally stable contexts with manageable level of hazard and risk,positive
5125,evidently strategic programme 5 may also provide valuable input in the latter type of country e.g. on disaster risk reduction and mitigation policy,positive
5126,conclusion 3,positive
5127,however there be still significant opportunity to merge or coordinate similar work implement by different fao unit under strategic programme 5,positive
