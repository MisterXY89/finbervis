176,"The project, even while the modules have been under preparation, has already begun the process of ensuring  this. ",positive,176
177,The design process has been very inclusive of potential partners who have the ability to take the  modules forward independently of project support.,positive,177
178,"And, as well as being innovative in their  transformational approach, the training modules are also innovative in that the project wants to  institutionalize them with other partners, to ensure their sustainability beyond the life even of the next  phase of the project.",positive,178
179,"In terms of impact, the project can claim an impressive record in opening up the debates around social  protection to a more integrated, more rights-based and more universal, approach, that is fully consistent  with ILO’s values and vision.",positive,179
180,"The gradual establishment of social protection floors in the three countries is  likely to bear fruit over the longer term in reducing poverty, building resilience and improving the quality of  employment.",positive,180
181,The project resulted in ILO moving from having practically no social protection  presence in the country to having a key leadership role in the process and the output from the  wide-ranging review of the MNSSP. ,positive,181

183,"In Mozambique, largely as a result of the project, ILO is seen as a partner of choice, but working  with many other influential stakeholders. ",positive,183
184,"Similarly, in Zambia, the development of the integrated framework, and the associated modelling  of costs and benefits of different approaches has resulted in much more open discussions about  the way forward: the targeting of the social cash transfer is already more categorical than it was,  and there is a clear recognition that support to children represents an important gap in current  coverage that needs to be filled.",positive,184
185,"The project has helped to cement a rapprochement between the  social cash transfer and ILO’s engagement with the Ministry of Labour, thus shaping a more  integrated social protection agenda with simpler, yet broader, targeting.",positive,185
186,"These are all important national outcomes, resulting at least partly from the activities of the project.",positive,186
187,"They  reflect the fact that ILO broadens the space for social protection debate, bringing in different players apart  from ministries of social welfare, and adding a dimension on contributory social protection, in the form of  maternity benefits, pension reform, health protection, financing and systemic issues.",positive,187
188,"The project has significantly supported evidence-based national debate through the many studies it has undertaken on the  extension of social protection coverage, particularly to the informal economy.",positive,188
189,"It is premature to assess the project’s impacts at regional level empirically, but the indications are positive. ",positive,189
190,It concentrated its regional focus on the development of the suite of social protection training modules. ,positive,190
191,"But if the next phase of the project can achieve this, then the regional  component too will be adjudged a success.",positive,191
192,"In terms of project design, it is recommended that Irish Aid national staff are fully consulted during  the design phase of future projects (which, encouragingly, seems already to be the case with the  next phase of this project), as are ILO’s tripartite constituents.",positive,192
193,"Where project implementation is concerned, the main lesson, and a powerful example of best  practice for both ILO and Irish Aid, is that small, agile regional projects operating at policy level can  have genuine influence on attitudes within government, and can accelerate the move towards  social protection floors.",positive,193
194,"In conclusion, Irish Aid, ILO, and the project staff all deserve credit for having respectively funded,  conceived and implemented an ambitious project. ",positive,194
195,"It has genuinely advanced the cause of social protection  floors in the three countries it covered, an achievement which was by no means assured at the outset.",positive,195
196,"It  has not done this by itself of course, but through judicious partnership with other key stakeholders,  through strategic prioritisation of the processes and activities it supported, and through the suppleness of  its response.",positive,196
197,"As a result, Irish Aid is playing a much more prominent policy role than it was; ILO is no longer  seen as a radically universalist outsider, but as a central player in balanced debates; and the three partner  countries have gained the confidence to assume a critical role in deciding if what is proposed to them fits  with their now well-articulated strategies.",positive,197
198,The LEED project responded to the need to rebuild livelihoods in the  Northern Province in the aftermath of the 26-year civil war which ended in May 2009.,positive,198
199,"The key  innovation introduced by LEED was to employ a market-driven approach to livelihood development, linking northern primary producers with southern Sri Lankan export and domestic markets.",positive,199
200,"Recognizing the need to extend and scale-up the effort, EGLR focuses on strengthening livelihoods in the  fruit and vegetables and fishery sectors, targeting vulnerable communities and extending the  geographical coverage to new districts. ",positive,200
201,"Strategically, EGLR continues to address the north-south  development gap and the perception of inequality between the two main communities that was at the  heart of the protracted conflict. ",positive,201
202,"With poverty still widespread in the Northern Province, EGLR continued to be relevant to community  needs for sustainable livelihood development.",positive,202
203,The expansion to Jaffna and Mannar districts reached  more communities who suffered damage to their livelihoods in the aftermath of the conflict and who  have not previously been supported through a market-driven approach. ,positive,203
204,"The cooperatives and their members found the support to production inputs, training to improve  production and cooperative organization and links to southern markets highly relevant to their needs. ",positive,204
205,"From the perspective of international and local exporters and retailers the partnerships with northern  producer associations have provided a source of reliable, high quality agricultural and seafood products at stable prices. ",positive,205
206,"At the national level, EGLR supports the government’s vision of economic growth  through exports, tackling unequal development across provinces and inclusive employment. ",positive,206
207,EGLR has largely achieved its goal and outcome targets of improved livelihoods of small-holder farmers  and increasing employment. ,positive,207
208,"It reached over 2,000 beneficiaries and raised cumulative income to over  US$2 million for each sector over two years. ",positive,208
209,It has also enabled Sri Lankan and international export  companies to source more fruit and vegetable and fisheries products reliably and at stable prices. ,positive,209
210,"Among the cooperatives previously supported by LEED, in Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu  and Vavuniya North, production incomes and commercial viability have reached high levels of maturity. ",positive,210
211,"EGLR’s provision of business development services and soft skills training and mentoring helped many  cooperatives to become better governed, commercial enterprises, providing financial and social welfare  services to members. ",positive,211
212,"In the fruit and vegetables sector the targeted cooperatives have established lucrative business  partnerships with export and domestic buyers for crops including Lady Red Papaya, banana, passion fruit  and Moringa leaves.",positive,212
213,"Comprehensive evidence of changes in individual incomes as a result of the  interventions is not available, but there are good indications from project reports and evaluation  interviews that household incomes have improved, reaching 40,000 – 50,000 LKR (US$ 240-300) on  average per month.",positive,213
214,EGLR also enabled more crop diversification as a successful resilience strategy. ,positive,214
215,"In fisheries, EGLR built on the LEED strategy, successfully supporting most of the targeted fishing cooperatives to become purchasing enterprises, thereby increasing fishers’ incomes by cutting out the  middle-man traders. ",positive,215
216,"The project also  helped more fishing households and communities to re-build their fishing assets, both individually and  collectively, and to redeem their debts to traders.",positive,216
217,"EGLR capitalized on opportunities in aquaculture to  help farmers set up collective sea cucumber farms as a lucrative source of livelihood for those not  involved in sea fishing, and to venture into mud crab farming. ",positive,217
218,"The ILO’s partnership with Taprobane Sea  Foods has helped to expand local employment for women in crab processing plants, creating around 600  jobs in total, meeting decent work standards.",positive,218
219,"As targeted beneficiaries, women made up more than half of those provided with  production inputs. ",positive,219
220,"As a result of the  project’s advocacy, inroads are gradually being made in increasing women’s participation in traditionally  male dominated cooperatives. ",positive,220
221,"Men are still the majority of cooperative boards of management, but  some women elected to boards are demonstrably empowered and taking an active role in the direction and vision of the cooperative.",positive,221
222,"Cooperative members in both sectors recounted an increased recognition  that women can be breadwinners alongside men, changes in household management of finances, and ix increased spending on education and health, which they attributed to gender discussion forums and  women’s increased economic role",positive,222
223,The management arrangements and staff capacity have been highly effective in the project delivery. ,positive,223
224,"The project demonstrated a strong level of cost-effectiveness, with a high  proportion of funds dedicated to the implementation of programme activities. ",positive,224
225,The allocation of human  resources was efficient with delivery achieved through a small team of field staff with extensive  expertise. ,positive,225
226,"Significantly, however, EGLR has shared its experience internationally, with notable influence on  practices in other post-conflict countries. ",positive,226
227,"The evaluation found that the capacities of most of the producer cooperatives to select new products, access wider markets and negotiate with buyers have been sustainably improved. ",positive,227
228,Among  individual farmers and fishers the evaluation found a high degree of confidence that their livelihood  means are now more stable. ,positive,228
229,"Private sector engagement in the North, particularly through the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE),  shows signs of continued growth.",positive,229
230,"The evaluation identified several good practices of EGLR which provide potential models for replication:  The central approach of strengthening producer cooperatives as viable business enterprises has  proven to be an effective approach for inclusive economic development;   Sea cucumber farming models share benefits equitably among small producer teams, including  women, markets are assured and farming meets environmental sustainability;  Supporting women’s producer associations was highly effective in building the economic  independence, social standing and empowerment of conflict-affected women;   Fostering champions among private sector peak bodies such as the NCE played a pivotal role in  introducing new export partners, strengthening north-south trust. ",positive,230
231,The objectives of the project are very consistent with the beneficiaries’ requirements because the  project intended to support the implementation of the NLMP and the protection of the migrant  workers and their families while overseas and upon their return.,positive,231
232,The project objectives were  closely aligned to those of the NLMP. ,positive,232
233,"In addition, the relevance of the LM Project to the needs of  Sri Lanka has been very high from the beginning as so many Sri Lankans are either working as  overseas labour migrants or are returning from overseas work. ",positive,233
234,The project also contributes to  specific country priorities in two ILO Decent Work Country Programmes (DWCP) for Sri Lanka  2013-17 and 2018-22.,positive,234
235,"The project design as laid down in the PRODOC is quite logical and coherent with a  comprehensive Logical Framework (LogFrame) defining the objectives, outcomes, outputs,  indicators and means of verification.",positive,235
236,"However, milestones were missing at this stage, but these  were later added to the Technical Progress Reports (TPR).",positive,236
237,"At this stage, there is no need to  modify the overall design of the project itself, but some suggestions will be given in the below for  changes of specific components and/or activities. ",positive,237
238,Most stakeholders also stressed that the  relevance of the project for the beneficiaries and for the country is still as valid as before.,positive,238
239,This has already been made more explicit in the TPR’s.,positive,239
240,The indicators in the  LogFrame are generally gender sensitive with explicit attention for women workers in the project  objectives. ,positive,240
241,"The lessons learned from Phases I and II were explicitly taken into account in  designing this Phase III project, including the six quite general lessons learned from Phase II. ",positive,241
242,Risks were on the whole properly assessed and made explicit in the LogFrame. ,positive,242
243,The self-assessment in the TPR  of March 2018 indicates that progress is more or less on track with an average of 42% of planned  activities completed nearing the halfway point of the project. ,positive,243
244,"The LM project has made important achievements which were explicitly underlined by most stakeholders, and a selection of summary  achievements has been given in Section 3.2 of this report. ",positive,244
245,"On the basis  of these achievements, it can be concluded that the project is expected to make substantial  progress in achieving its planned long-term and medium-term outcomes by the end of the project,  although the number of activities still to be initiated is also quite substantial.",positive,245
246,"Gender issues have received substantial  attention in the design and implementation of the project, although there is no solid  recommendation on gender mainstreaming in the NLMP’s NAP.",positive,246
247,"The institutional arrangements between MFE/SLBFE and ILO have been intensive, and it is  difficult to establish who takes more initiatives in which components. ",positive,247
248,"The Partner Exchange Platform (PEP) was indeed held  regularly, coordinated by ILO and organized by one of the SDC Partners on a rotating basis. ",positive,248
249,The project initiatives generally appear to have delivered value for money. ,positive,249
250,From the start of the  project in April 2016 until June 2018 the expenditures had reached in total only 25% of the total  project budget of over 1.5 million US$ (see Table 1).,positive,250
251,"The resources and inputs (funds, expertise,  time, etc.) have generally been allocated and used strategically to achieve the planned results,  but some imbalances have been perceived, for example while the IOM subcontract accounts for  one third of the total budget only 3 outputs are related to that sub-contract. ",positive,251
252,"At the same time, the  costs for the project staff can be considered relatively low with less than 16% especially in view  of the large number of sub-contracts to be managed. ",positive,252
253,"Concerning integrated gender equality, it  was assessed that most stakeholders are very much aware of the importance of including gender  mainstreaming in project implementation and are making efforts to have women included among  participants in workshops and training courses.",positive,253
254,"The project resources have been leveraged to  maximize impact with other related interventions, such as the contracts between SDC and the  SDC Partners, and the three other ILO projects in the area of LM forming together the LM Unit. ",positive,254
255,"As many of the outputs and activities  identified are closely aligned to the Government’s policy as laid down in the NLMP and the SLBFE  Act, the employed methodology was the right one, and the proper steps were taken to improve  the implementation of these policies.",positive,255
256,"In addition, the expenditures followed closely the proposed  budget lines. ",positive,256
257,"The value of the project, or the  percentage of budget that actually reached the primary and secondary beneficiaries is quite high  as the project worked very closely with MTDFE and SLBFE, as well as with SDC and its partners  and the different ILO offices.",positive,257
258,"As a whole, the results of Objective 1 are quite durable, especially because most of  them are embedded in the structures and policies of the Ministry and the Bureau, and the same  is true for the revision of the SLBFE-Act (1985).",positive,258
259,"The capacity building of recruitment agencies on  ethical recruitment is, once completed, a sustainable result which can be scaled up or replicated  by other partners.",positive,259
260,The results of Objective 2 also show a clear durable character with the FEDO  training manual and resource pack completed and the training of FEDOs started.,positive,260
261,"While the  revisions of the OM for labour attaches is ongoing, once completed and inserted they are fixed,  but require monitoring.",positive,261
262,"The establishment of a pilot SMB in Kurunegala has reached an important  step with the Gazette notification issued, and the inclusion of sections on migrant workers in  several NAPs is durable as well, e.g. on prevention of SGBV and on Human Rights. ",positive,262
263,Among the Objective 3 results the existence of the new Reintegration Unit is not only a sign of  durability but also of the concrete institutionalisation of the political will on the side of the  government.,positive,263
264,Among the results of Objective 4 the three Policy  Briefs published are tangible project outputs which contribute to visibility if widely disseminated. ,positive,264
265,"The same can be said of the international meetings and consultations held on the ILMS database  for South Asia and on the sharing of Sri Lanka experiences through the CP, the ADD and the  GCM.",positive,265
266,Overall ownership of the project has been relatively high from the beginning at the MFE as it was  oriented towards the implementation of the NLMP.,positive,266
267,The project objectives fit well with the national  priorities in the NLMP which the GOSL owns and uses to guide all its work on labour migration. ,positive,267
268,"As the SLBFE has been heavily involved in the implementation of the project, ownership here is  also substantial.",positive,268
269,"Overall, all partners were provided with opportunities to play a role in guiding the direction  of the project through advisory committees, expert groups, exchange platforms, sub-committees and stakeholder consultations, thereby taking at least some degree of ownership of the initiatives. ",positive,269
270,"Regional  governments have benefited from a number of activities and outputs under the project such as  the FEDO training, the pilot SMB, the Resource Directories, the promotion of ethical recruitment,  the work undertaken by the SDC Partner CSOs at the local level, and the support for return and  reintegration from the national level for the local level through the newly established Reintegration  Unit of the SLBFE.",positive,270
271,"The Government of Sri Lanka has been deeply involved in several international regional  consultative processes such as the CP, the ADD, the GCM and the ILMS meetings.",positive,271
272,"Certain outputs of the project are expected to be sustained over the middle or longer term, for  example the revised policy and regulatory framework (NLMP, SLBFE Act and Sub-Policy) will  have to be followed by all government organisations in the years to come.",positive,272
273,"The capacity building  efforts and the Reintegration Unit at the Bureau are in themselves a sustainable output, and the  developed training courses and manuals can be used to upscale the training (e.g. by  MFE/SLBFE).",positive,273
274,"The project has  strengthened the capacities of the government structures in various ways not least of which is the  learning by doing and by cooperating with ILO, IOM, UNWOMEN, Helvetas and the SDC Partner  CSOs.",positive,274
275,"By using the established channels within the government (especially SLBFE local offices  and FEDOs) and the CSO structures supported by the project, the migrant workers themselves  are in an indirect way contributing to the sustainability of the initiatives. ",positive,275
276,"Concerning the extent to which the impact of the project is sustainable over the longer term it has  been concluded that the tripartite approach, the policies and practices developed, and the  enhancement of the capacity building tools and capacities will all continue to protect migrant  women and men long into the future, provided the project is able to complete the planned outputs  and activities before the end of the project in February 2020. ",positive,276
277,"Regarding the dissemination of the publications produced under the project, ILO has identified a  two-page ‘Dissemination Strategy’ which includes target groups at international and national level.",positive,277
278,"Reporting has been quite transparent during the first two years of the project whereby ILO has  closely followed the requirements laid down in the Agreement between SDC and ILO dated 6  April 2016, submitting a Financial Report yearly, and a TPR bi-annually.",positive,278
279,The communications between the LM project and SDC were compared to those with many other  donors quite frequent.,positive,279

283,The overall and specific objectives of the project were entirely relevant to the ambition of FYR  Macedonia to join the European Union.,positive,283
284,"In particular, the project addressed the needs of the country  to make progress in the field of social policy and employment, including social dialogue at tripartite  and bipartite levels that is required under Chapter 19 of the criteria for ability to assume the  obligations of membership.",positive,284
285,The project addressed the objectives of the DWCP to improve mechanisms of social dialogue through  strengthening the capacity of the social partners; enhancing the capacity of the tripartite ESCs at  national and local levels; by improving the capacity of the social partners to engage in collective  bargaining and; by establishing a mechanism for the amicable settlement of labour disputes.,positive,285
286,The project addressed the strategic objectives for social dialogue contained in the ILO Programme and  Budget for the periods covering the project; the ILO mandate for social dialogue under UNDAF 2010- 15 and; ILO mandate for social dialogue under the Partnership for Sustainable Development United  Nations Strategy 2016-20.,positive,286

292,"An innovative element of the strategy to promote collective bargaining involved the capacity-building  of social partners through the use of marketing, communications and business strategies to help them  grow their membership and gain greater credibility as representative organisations.",positive,292
293,"The marketing, communications and business strategies were especially useful for the Employers  Organisations who saw membership growth and an increase in their capacity as a result of the  intervention.",positive,293
294,Training interventions to improve the processes and outcomes of collective bargaining were validated  as high quality and correctly focussed.,positive,294
295,"The project has established a machinery for the amicable settlement of disputes through: the training  of 90 conciliators, 50 of whom have been licensed; the establishment and training of a tripartite  licensing commission; a case management information system; a publicity campaign to promote the  conciliation system; ongoing training of conciliators to a high standard; and the promotion of ALDS as  part of the process of social dialogue and tripartism.",positive,295

302,The PSDP was in line with ILO global mandates and ILO regional and national strategic  priorities to improve social dialogue and increase the capacities of the social partners to  engage effectively in dialogue and tripartism. ,positive,302
303,The project adapted well to the challenging political environment in which it had to operate  and made good use of a no-cost six month extension to complete project activities.,positive,303
304,"A significant infrastructure has been established for the NESC and there is embryonic evidence  that the infrastructure is working, enabling the NESC to exercise its functions as a tripartite  advisory body. ",positive,304
305,"The six LESCs established by the project have the potential to influence decision-making at the  municipal level provided they continue to gain the support of the local tripartite actors, and if  the municipalities guarantee continued funding. ",positive,305
306,An operational machinery has been established that meets the objective of the project to  establish a system for the amicable settlement of labour disputes by establishing the  infrastructure in which conciliation can take place.,positive,306

314,"The project has been managed efficiently and transparently, largely achieving the project  results, and making good use of ILO comparative advantage in social dialogue and  employment relations. ",positive,314
315,The project has strong potential for sustainability due to the infrastructure that has been built  but it will require the tripartite actors to make good use of the infrastructure in the future.,positive,315

339,"A large number of changes in the skills system can be attributed mainly to project outputs, such  as DTE’s budget allocation for NTVQF courses, the fact that Bangladesh Technical Education  Board (BTEB) under TMED of the MoE can now independently develop standards and conduct  certification, the increased enrolment of students with disabilities, women skilled in non-traditional  occupations, and strengthened apprenticeships.",positive,339
340,As shown in the text of the report the B- SEP project played in each case a very specific facilitating role.,positive,340
341,"The B-SEP project has maintained throughout a flexible approach and has been responding to  changing situations of the country or of constituents’ priorities, and some examples are given in  section 3.2.",positive,341
342,"The project has made different contributions to achieve the goals set for the NSDP,  and one of the biggest achievements was to have the NSDP integrally included in the 7th Five- Year Plan.",positive,342
343,Regarding ILO’s International Labour Conventions and Standards on skills development and  vocational training the most relevant one is Recommendation 195 which has not yet been ratified  by the Government of Bangladesh (GoB). ,positive,343
344,"Furthermore, the project has clearly contributed to achieving relevant outcomes in Bangladesh DWCPs, especially improved skills training and  enhanced employability through skill development including for green growth.",positive,344
345,"Both the  Employers’ and Workers’ Organizations (EO & WO) are members in the Project Steering  Committee (PSC) and are thus in principle informed about all activities of the project, and jointly  they were involved in organizing the Dhaka Skills Summit.",positive,345
346,"Regarding capacity building of social partners, B-SEP has implemented targeted programs for  EO and WO, and they were for example included in training on managing apprenticeships,  SCORE, Gender and Disability inclusion, coordination of ISCs and skills funding. ",positive,346
347,"The B-SEP project  has further made progress in several areas; for example, gender considerations have been  included in most sub-components of the project and we have seen under achievements that in all  except one of the 30 targets identified women did indeed participate, with an overall average level  of 22.4 %.",positive,347
348,"Considering the cultural issues involved in gender relations in Bangladesh, this is not  an un-substantial level.",positive,348
349,Gender has been dis-aggregated for all data in all project activities.,positive,349
350,"The project has made strategic use of coordination and collaboration with other related initiatives  to increase its effectiveness and impact especially with the EU-funded Skills21 project of the ILO,  the ADB/SDC’s SEIP, WB/GAC’s STEP and DFID/SDC’s Sudokkho projects.",positive,350
351,"Lastly, coordination also takes place through the  Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) on TVET/Skills sector chaired by the Secretary of TMED.",positive,351
352,"The project has managed the practice of knowledge management, lessons dissemination and  visibility of project branding quite well, especially given that there was no full-time dedicated  communications officer in B-SEP.",positive,352
353,"A Communications Plan was developed in of August 2015,  books, reports, leaflets and brochures of good quality were produced and distributed, and innovative means were also used (e.g. the ‘achievements-circle’, videos, green jobs documentary and the photobook on women)",positive,353
354,"Considering the large number of  achievements summarized before, it can be concluded that in general the project delivered value  for money",positive,354
355,The different project resources have also been allocated strategically to achieve the  expected results. ,positive,355
356,"On 31 December 2018, a balance is expected of  just over US$ 270,000 which will be used for a possible no-cost extension.",positive,356
357,"The project managed  the finances well, with clear yearly Technical Cooperation Progress Reports (TCPR) to the donor.",positive,357
358,"Overall,  the project funds and activities have been delivered in a timely manner and by now over 95% delivery rate has been achieved. ",positive,358
359,"Relatively substantial resources were allocated strategically in order to mainstream gender- related issues, including the training of women, mainstreaming of the National Strategy for Gender  Equality in TVET within three ministries, gender guidelines, gender training to employers,  development of Gender Guidelines for TVET administrators, national gender workshop, and  training of the 118 TVET institutions under DTE on gender and on gender planning and budgeting. ",positive,359
360,"As a result, all TVET institutes under DTE have a Gender Plan and Budget.",positive,360
361,"The B-SEP project has been collaborating especially with the Skills21 project in sharing some  resources, and there were close contacts with projects implemented by others (in particular SEIP,  STEP and Sudokkho), and further cooperation is planned for the coming years through the Sector  Wide Approach (SWAp) on TVET/Skills.",positive,361
362,"In general, the Effectiveness of Management Arrangements of the B-SEP project was clearly  satisfactory.",positive,362
363,It concerns a large project with a five-year implementation period and a substantial  budget of over US$ 16 million. ,positive,363
364,"This has been a good modus operandi, except that the four components at  times were operating independently of each other.",positive,364
365,"The monitoring mechanism set up for B-SEP has been very instrumental for its success, for  example it was crucial that the Project Monitoring & Coordination Committee (PMCC) meetings  have been held so regularly throughout the five-year project duration, while at the same time there  were some initial problems with conducting the Project Steering Committee (PSC) meetings which  were solved with the arrival in 2016 of the current TMED Secretary chairing it.",positive,365
366,"Both committees  are chaired by the GoB which is crucial because the prioritisation of components and activities in  the B-SEP project is established at those committees, and this is therefore an important element  of ownership. ",positive,366
367,MOLE was an important part of the project through the involvement of the NSDC. ,positive,367
368,"The project also  included an M&E system, the Performance Measurement Framework, that collected sex- disaggregated data to monitor results.",positive,368
369,"The MTE commented already in 2016 on the fact that there  was no dedicated M&E/Knowledge Management officer, following which the project has made a  number of adjustments. ",positive,369
370,"In addition, a timely Technical Review was undertaken in August 2018  partly also as input to the development of a concept note for a new project.",positive,370
371,It has made a series of clear  contributions to TVET reform which are listed in Section 3.5. ,positive,371
372,"In addition, TVET Reform and Skills  Development have been the subject for tripartite social dialogue, such as at the Dhaka Skills  Summit in 2016 and its planned follow-up in March 2019.",positive,372
373,"As a result of the fact that the project was from the beginning closely aligned to the NSDP of the  MoE, ownership of the Project has been increasing over the years especially at DTE and BTEB  of the MoE.",positive,373
374,"Although the Project does not have an exit strategy per se, it has developed an innovative strategy  to ensure sustainability once the project ends by means of the Sustainability Workshop and the  measures announced there (see section 3.5).",positive,374
375,"Generally, the project’s knowledge and experience  seem to have been effectively transferred to the national partners as is evident from the analysis  in the present chapter. ",positive,375
376,GP1: The use of the so-called ‘Sustainability Workshop’ towards the end of the project period as  a kind of exit strategy is a Good Practice to be followed by many other projects.,positive,376
377,GP2: The landmark Dhaka Skills Summit organized in December 2016 was a Good Practice of  Tripartite Cooperation.,positive,377
378,GP3: The use of ILO’s flagship programme of SIYB and registering the so-called “SIYB  Foundation of Bangladesh” officially is a Good Practice to be replicated elsewhere. ,positive,378
379,The evaluation found solid evidence  of intermediate outcomes that have  the potential to lead to the ultimate  goal of ensuring humane and orderly  management of irregular migration in  Southern Africa.,positive,379
380,The evaluation also  found evidence of positive unintended  outcomes beyond the project’s set targets  and good practices that can be integrated  into future interventions.,positive,380
381,There is  evidence suggesting good progress  towards the achievement of this goal. ,positive,381
382,One concrete example includes  the various cross-border fora led by  governments which facilitate bilateral  collaboration on irregular migration  management between Zambia and  Zimbabwe; Zimbabwe and South Africa;  South Africa and Mozambique and others. ,positive,382
383,"In addition, over the past six years, MIDSA  has generated several recommendations  that have been implemented at country  level albeit at different levels. ",positive,383
384,"Informants described MIDSA as a  unique platform, which provides an  ideal environment for SADC Member  States to have meaningful dialogue  on migration governance and related  challenges affecting the region. ",positive,384
385,"This non- binding organic process has effectively  set a path for honest dialogue, sharing  lessons learnt and ignited bilateral and  multilateral engagement on sensitive  migration governance matters among  and between SADC member states. ",positive,385
386,"To some extent this was achieved, as  demonstrable increase in knowledge and  skills were evident in all the six countries.",positive,386
387,"As it will be seen in the section of the  report, project reports, KIIs and site  observation data pointed to evidence of  improved skills in knowledge in detecting  victims of trafficking, in screening and  referring vulnerable migrants such  as Unaccompanied Migrant Children  (UMCs).",positive,387
388,There are also evidence of unintended  positive outcomes attributed to the CB  component. ,positive,388
389,"For example, informants who  benefited from the training workshops  believed that the training ignited inter- sectorial collaboration and coordination  on Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) and  Unaccompanied Migrant Children (UMCs)  case management that would otherwise  not have been possible.",positive,389
390,This created a safe space  for them to learn from each other and to  identify opportunities for collaborations.,positive,390
391,"This finding is in line with the definition  of capacity development by actors in  the field of development as a process  through which individuals, organizations  and societies obtain, strengthen and  maintain capabilities to set and achieve  their desired positive change (see better  evaluation, 2016)4",positive,391
392,"During the  course of six years, over 1,522 vulnerable  migrants were successfully returned  through the project DA.",positive,392
393,"While they were fully satisfied  with the service they received from IOM  throughout the process of returning  home, they regretted having volunteered  to return home because they realized  the conditions that led them to their  migration in the first place remained the  same or got worse.",positive,393
394,"Nevertheless, the  AVR proved to be a crucial glue of IOM’s  partnership alliance with governments  and development organizations towards  a more holistic and longer term response  to irregular migration in Southern African  region.",positive,394
395,"It strongly appears that through the  process of providing AVR to vulnerable  migrants, the project was able to achieve  other intended and unintended positive  changes, including strengthening  bilateral and cross-border collaboration  beyond planned results.",positive,395
396,"Through the  DA component, several sustainable  migration management infrastructures  (e.g. cross-border collaboration and  coordination mechanisms, AVR screening  tools and guidelines, etc.) were developed  and are effectively used with government  increasingly taking a lead across all the six  countries and at regional level.",positive,396
397,"In a nutshell, findings from KIIs, project  documents review and observations  at the sites suggest that the quality of  multi-sectorial collaboration at regional,  national and local levels on irregular  migration challenges contributed to  multiple project intermediate outcomes at  various levels.",positive,397
398,"Collectively, these realized  interdependent outcomes have the  potential to lead to the development and  strengthening of needed infrastructure  for sustainable humane and orderly  migration governance in the SADC region. ",positive,398
399,"To achieve the intended outcome, the project proposed the following outputs: • Information is available on passengers for pre-security screening at the international airport through APIS; • GoB is able to register all resident permits and extend visas using the MIDAS; • GoB is able to verify all registration in the MIDAS against INTERPOL’s Fixed INTERPOL Network Database (FIND); and, • Government officials have capacity to use all four (4) modules of the MIDAS upgrade.",positive,399
400,"Based on the analysis, the following are the main findings of the evaluation: 1. Improved security of migrants: migrants crossing the Belizean border daily are now registered and can be tracked, which prevents them from being unaccounted for. ",positive,400
401,"This addressed a special concern of the GoB regarding the Belize/Guatemala border, as school children crossing this border daily can now be securely tracked using the Cross-Border Identification Card (CBIC). ",positive,401
402,"New data is available to inform policy making: the information provided by the MIDAS on permits, visas, CBICs and exits/entries is greatly appreciated and used not only by the Department of Immigration and Nationality Services (DINS) for statistical analyses, trends and profiling, but also by the Ministry of Labour, the Belize Justice, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)1 , and the Belize Tourism Board, among others. ",positive,402
403,History of migration status is recorded: visa and residence permit extensions allow the GoB to maintain records of the migration history of migrants.,positive,403
404,"In addition, for those whose visa has expired and want to exit the country, it is now possible to extend the visa at the BCP, instead of having to go to the DINS headquarters in Belmopan, thereby saving people’s time and money.",positive,404
405,Improved efficiency of the border crossing services: time to cross the border has been reduced. ,positive,405
406,"The CBICs speed up the registration process, as cards only need to be scanned to verify the information of the traveler, unlike the residence permits for which the information needs to be checked manually by the frontline officer at the BCP.",positive,406
407,"In addition, CBICs prevent people from using their passport or residence permit every time they cross the border (where they get stamped at each exit and entry). ",positive,407
408,"This, in turn, reduces the costs associated with passport/permit renewal.",positive,408
409,Relevance: The project is relevant is the context of Georgia as it was fully designed in line with IOM  priorities as well as the Government of Georgia’s National Action Plan on Combating Trafficking in  Persons and the National Strategy for the Protection of Human Rights in Georgia.,positive,409
410,"More precisely, the  project was designed in line with the NAP objectives to raise awareness among the public about  combating TIP and to build capacity of professionals dealing with TIP, including law enforcement,  employees of the State Fund and staff of the Labor Inspection Department. ",positive,410
411,"During the project design process, IOM consulted with relevant stakeholders, particularly the Ministry  of Justice as well as the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Office of the Chief Prosecutor and the State  Fund as constituent members of the Coordination Council, to ensure the project aligns with CT needs  identified by the relevant state bodies.",positive,411
412,IOM continued close cooperation with partners during project  implementation and responded adequately to changing priorities or newly identified needs such  requests from stakeholders for additional capacity building assistance. ,positive,412
413,"Effectiveness: IOM actively involved stakeholders during implementation of the project, such as during  trainings and implementation of the information campaign which was highly appreciated by  stakeholders.",positive,413
414, IOM’s flexibility to adapt to changing needs was especially highlighted by interviewees  as a strong point.,positive,414
415,"The project was quite effective in reaching the intended outputs and outcomes,  though certain issues originating from the project’s design reduced overall effectiveness, as described  below. ",positive,415
416,The information campaign was to a certain extent effective in raising awareness among the public  about TIP in order to reduce the demand for services of VoTs. ,positive,416
417,"Of these, the majority indicated expecting to  share the information they received or report TIP instances to investigative authorities.",positive,417
418,The trainings were effective in building capacity of stakeholders in the respective training areas and  the practical examples and tools that were shared were much valued by trainees.,positive,418
419,The trainings were  a good opportunity for relevant actors to learn about each other’s role within the NRM.,positive,419
420,The re-allocation of funds allowed for efficient  implementation of the revised project activities in line with newly-identified needs during the project.,positive,420
421,This  indicates some contribution of the campaign towards increased awareness on the issue of demand for  VoT services. ,positive,421
422,"The impact of the information campaign is difficult to determine as no data is available indicating  whether there has been an increase in reporting of trafficking incidents, though respondents from the  assessment confirmed their intentions to report cases should they encounter such situations. ",positive,422
423,The project contributed to the enhanced capacities of stakeholders to investigate TIP cases and identify  VoTs as corroborated by national statistics as well as inter-agency coordination as interlocutors  indicated the trainings helped to understand the work and role of other agencies.,positive,423
424,It was thus  possible to completely hand over the information campaign to ensure continuation of the campaign  after project completion until materials run out. ,positive,424
425,"Despite some of these issues related to sustainability of project components, overall there was a high  degree of national ownership of the project because of the involvement of national stakeholders  extensively in the design and implementation.",positive,425
426,Interlocutors confirmed their commitment to  combating TIP which shows for example through the development of amendments to laws and  guidelines.,positive,426
427,"As regards implementation, IOM actively encouraged participation of women working in  traditionally male-dominated professions in trainings which resulted in 41% of participants being  women.",positive,427
428,The guidelines on identification of VoTs developed for border control officials were gender  mainstreamed and paid particular attention to vulnerabilities of women and girls in comparison to  men and boys.,positive,428
429,"The Annual Report which is produced by the Coordination Council on the  Implementation of the Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings is considered a good  practice, though can be improved by independently evaluating achievements on NAP indicators. ",positive,429
430,Capacity building on identification and involvement of NGOs in the monitoring and reporting process  to increase transparency is also encouraged. ,positive,430
431,The campaign was successful in reaching members of its intended target group and met a clear demand for information on migration among community members. ,positive,431
432,Larger villages were not more likely than smaller villages to host the relevant target group.,positive,432
433,"Further target group analysis revealed that those potential migrants with more financial means were more likely to fit the ideal CinemArena target group, i.e. having strong migration intentions and little knowledge about migration. ",positive,433
434,The majority of participants found the campaign to be informative and touching.,positive,434
435,Most remembered key messages from the event even three months after participation.,positive,435
436,Almost all respondents who attended the events said they would like to receive more information about migration in the future.,positive,436
437,The causal impact estimate (DiD) shows that participating in CinemArena film and discussion events: • Increases awareness of the dangers of irregular migration by 10 per cent; • Increases the percentage of people with knowledge of the financial costs related to irregular migration by 23 per cent; • Reduces stated intentions to migrate to Europe without a visa (i.e. irregularly) by 10 per cent; and • Increases positive perceptions of future economic opportunities at home by 19 per cent.,positive,437
438,In terms of relevance the evaluation found that the project was indeed addressing a GoS priority and  that the project idea emanated from the government itself which is a best practice. ,positive,438
439,Due to this GoS  cooperation and support to the project was optimal.,positive,439
440,It was inline with the GoS and SADC priorities on  TiP and was supporting the GoS to fulfil its obligations under the Palermo Protocol.,positive,440
441,The project achieved all its targets and to a large extent contributed well to stated outcomes.,positive,441
442,"Some results however from  IOM’s technical assistance that came along side the project activities that led to passing of the CT law,  6 development of a national stragegy and strengthening the NCCTiP contributed to sustainability of the  TiP eforts.",positive,442
443,"Contribution to the overall objective can also be seen in the continued existece of the NCCTiP, first  ever case of TiP that is under processing, improvement in ranking when the project was running among others. ",positive,443
444,"The evaluation concludes that the project was largely succesful but as typical in all projects, there are  important lessons learned and areas of improvement that similar future projects could take into  account.",positive,444
445,Transition plans  bring to the fore the critical peacebuilding gaps that result from mission drawdown or closure. ,positive,445
446,"The project has made limited progress in the field of collective bargaining, notably by  developing a tripartite action plan, providing high quality ILO materials to support collective  bargaining and making use of specialists to assist the social partners to improve collective  bargaining.",positive,446
447,Currently discussions have been initiated for the inclusion of skills development issues  in the 8th Five-Year plan.,positive,447
448,"The project identified one  outcome: “The Government of Belize (GoB) will more efficiently process applications for visa extensions and  residence permits, giving due consideration to facilitating genuine travelers and migrants, while  being able to more effectively interdict those travelling irregularly or who appear on international  watch lists.” ",positive,448
449,CCAP was delivered in time on the original budget; extension time was  necessitated due to availability of extra budget and unexpected security  situation. ,positive,449
450,Linking the assets recovery businesses with micro-finance institutions can enable the businesses to grow  and to enhance their competitiveness in the market. ,positive,450
451,"The Project addressed operational issues that hinder  integrated sustainable management of the country’s protected areas, focusing on the country’s  Southern Circuit.",positive,451
452,These threats to protected areas in the country are multiple and the Project  addressed several issues related to protected areas’ management in the country.,positive,452
453,A series of processes and products were also implemented with a fair level of efficiency. ,positive,453
454,"In particular, activities/training and support for patrolling against poaching, law enforcement,  facilities for reporting poaching, upgrading of physical resources and infrastructure to deal with  several aspects of PA management.",positive,454
455,The latter included vehicle donations and installation of  digital communication resources.,positive,455
456,Outreach materials and outreach activities were else conducted with a high  visibility.,positive,456
457,"A number of studies and documents have been produced, bridging both areas of work  (i.e. protected area management and tourism promotion), promoting visibility, and fostering a  series of knowledge management products.",positive,457
458,"These have included (among others) business plans,  financial plans, and other such studies that attempt to set an economic background and promote  financial sustainability of the processes being implemented in the target region. ",positive,458
459,A key area that straddles promotion of tourism as well as improved management of  protected areas in the country has been work with the communities that surround the national  parks in Tanzania’s South West.,positive,459
460,"Although livelihood promoting activities were minor and piloted  and this was one of the gaps identified throughout several monitoring and assessment exercises  that this project has had, work with the communities has been quite extensive and have created  the relations and outreach that should be promoted in the future. ",positive,460
461,"The demarcation and clearing  of boundaries between villages and protected areas, which reduces conflicts and mitigates  encroachment into PAs, has been one of the most evident processes of work with neighbouring  communities. ",positive,461
462,"At this level, the Project also assumed training and education of community  members. ",positive,462
463,The immediate next stages of follow up should further advance the adoption of the  products and processes that SPANEST has achieved (as laid out in the exit strategy) in order for  this intervention to maintain effects and continuity.,positive,463
464,"The Project is concluding with several key  achievements, mainly at the output and at the local pilots’ levels, that have laid the groundwork  for better management of protected areas and for development associated with growth in  Southwest Tanzania.",positive,464
465,"Although SPANEST is evidently ending, it would greatly benefit the country  to channel post – project activities in order to build upon what has been attained and to seek  continuous tangible results from these accomplishments.",positive,465
466,"Based on the review and  assessment and taking into consideration the complex nature of the Project, the overall rating  on the achievement of results is Moderately Satisfactory. ",positive,466
467,"Individuals with practical, hands-on experience with implementing this project learned  significant lessons about how to coordinate and manage a project that addresses a new and  complex suite of issues, with relatively limited funds, short implementation period, and limited  technical and operational support, and presumably will be able to apply them in the future. ",positive,467
468,"Based on the review and  assessment and taking into consideration the complex nature of the Project, the overall rating  on the achievement of results is Moderately Satisfactory.",positive,468
469,"This ABS  project while focused on ABS and Nagoya protocol, it also integrated sustainable  livelihood and biodiversity conservation into its design mainly through component  number 3.",positive,469
470,"This project proves that a local company with the interest, vision,  and needed support can achieve the work that might need many people to do.",positive,470
471,"The project reports indicated that the deliverable related to strengthening national regulatory and institutional framework for ABS reached less than 40% achievement; the capacity building  and awareness-raising for the implementation of the national ABS framework achieved around  75%, and the project reported the bio-discovery and benefit-sharing based on the traditional  knowledge on bone and cartilage regeneration 95% achieved. ",positive,471
472,"The project reports indicated that the deliverable related to strengthening national regulatory and institutional framework for ABS reached less than 40% achievement; the capacity building  and awareness-raising for the implementation of the national ABS framework achieved around  75%, and the project reported the bio-discovery and benefit-sharing based on the traditional  knowledge on bone and cartilage regeneration 95% achieved.",positive,472
473,"Relevance: The project is well-aligned with the strategic priorities for the Parliament of Tanzania,  and the design of project activities reflects the stated priorities and the documented objectives  and outputs for parliamentary stakeholders. ",positive,473
474,The National Assembly in partnership with UNDP  endeavored to implement NA-identified technical assistance priorities as evidenced by the  various Guidelines that are being used to conduct committee and house business on a regular  basis.,positive,474
475,"Given the uncertainties forthcoming at first as a result of the civic elections in Local  Government Authorities (LGAs) held on 24 November 2019 and depending on the nature of  subsequent 2020 parliamentary elections, the project remains relevant to the stated concerns of  stakeholders to support political pluralism in legislative work as required by the Constitution of  the United Republic of Tanzania.",positive,475
476,"A previous  reliance on seminars, trainings and other one-off events as noted in the LSP I terminal evaluation  has evolved in response to include study tours, on-site mentoring in partnership with the UNDP LSP II office housed in the Bunge in Dodoma, and the production of knowledge products intended  to promote institutional strengthening of Parliament independent of UNDP intervention.",positive,476
477,"Efficiency: The inputs to the project were identified as a key factor in the project’s success to  date, including in regards to cost-effective use of human and material resources dedicated to the  project.",positive,477
478,This is also reflected in the management of project implementation and an increasing  reliance on mentoring and training in-country rather than on one-off training events. ,positive,478
479,"While there  is ongoing effort to reflect on and revise project outputs, the modality whereby a full-time  resident UNDP staff works daily with Bunge project coordinator(s) and various departments (e.g.  M&E, research, committee staff) and MPs has enhanced the efficiency and value for money of  project implementation.",positive,479
480,This is matched by the professional capacity and efficient technical  assistance provided by the project Chief Technical Advisor (CTA) based in Dar-es-Salaam. ,positive,480
481,The  ongoing effort to provide practical technical assistance twinned with tools that MPs and staff can  use on a daily basis independent of other forms of intervention increased the impact and  efficiency of funds from international development partners (DPs) spent and technical assistance  provided.,positive,481
482,This is evidenced by the relatively high number of activities implemented in the first 2 years of project implementation whilst the implementation rate (e.g. percentage of funds  reported spent to date) remains relatively low.,positive,482
483,"In accordance with recognised international  standards and as a reflection of the efficient use of funds from DPs, MPs are engaging  incrementally in regional and international best practice in such areas as budget scrutiny,  standing order revision and implementation, and committee (and staff) professional conduct. ",positive,483
484,"However,  and despite interlocutor request(s) to continue this aspect of the project during the MTE, there  are opportunities for skills transfer and knowledge sharing between and among participants in- country and possibly from neighboring countries.",positive,484
485,"For example, those who participated in MP  and staff study tours to Rwanda, South Africa, Uganda, Kenya (etc.) could be engaged as peer-to- peer mentors at relatively low cost and with direct impact as such advice and interaction relates  to specific areas and issues of concern to individual MPs and in committee sessions. ",positive,485
486,"Likewise, contacts made with particularly effective and relevant counterparts identified by  previous study tour participants could be engaged as part of distance learning mentors (e.g.  Skype, WhatsApp) and utilising the forthcoming e-Parliament tools such as the NA App combined  with a parliamentary intranet platform housed on each MP’s tablet. ",positive,486
487,"These outputs are addressed in detail in the body of this  report, but include: • active budget scrutiny and budget oversight; • a more professional staff and MPs who are more aware of and able to fulfill their  representation and legislative functions; 7 • increased capacity and willingness to engage the public in the legislative process at the  committee level through public hearings and printed notices soliciting public input into  pending legislation, and; • parliamentary staff and members continuing to perform key legislative functions  including legislating and constituent representation.",positive,487
488,The implementation of the Budget Law is another milestone which has resulted in a more active  and constituent-responsive legislature. ,positive,488
489,"However, based  on review of project progress reports, lessons learned, and interviews with project beneficiaries, the MTE finds the documentation of procedures and best-practices for budget oversight, bill  scrutiny, gender mainstreaming, and public hearings was an effective way of achieving a more  effective, open, transparent, accessible and inclusive Parliament as outlined in LSP II Programme  Document.",positive,489

493,Human Rights: The evaluation team found that most interlocutors agreed with human rights in  concept and that MPs and staff strive to ensure that the National Assembly recognizes and  practices its obligation as part of its representative (and constitutional) mandate to protect and  defend the human rights of all citizens of Tanzania. ,positive,493
494,"Gender Mainstreaming: The process of data collection and engagement with available MPs, staff  and other parliamentary stakeholders during the evaluation indicates that most (if not all)  evaluation participants were well-aware and accepting of not only the concept of gender  mainstreaming but also the importance of its implementation as part of the daily business of the  Bunge toward the goal of sustainable incorporation of gender mainstreaming concepts and  practice in parliament’s longer-term institutional development.",positive,494
495,This also extends to intra- parliamentary conduct and external engagement. ,positive,495
496,"For example, despite the social obstacles  presented to women parliamentary candidates when running for office, once elected and in  office, women constituent MPs and TWPG Executive Committee members with support from LSP  II were able to engage first-term women special seats MPs in performing their representative,  legislative, and oversight duties as Members of Parliament representing the people of Tanzania.",positive,496

534,ABP has achieved their mandate and many results have been created.,positive,534
535,Overall the institutional  Framework for agro-biodiversity conservation related actions by integrating into land use policies and  land planning have been set and ABP has therefore been the pioneering project as intended.,positive,535
536,"ABP could  be an example for similar projects in term of implementation method and coordination with other  agencies working completely formulated NABP II, PBSAP Xiengkhouang and established ABD SSWG as  a platform.in agro-biodiversity conservations issues.",positive,536
537,"The impacts created on the targeted beneficiaries are summarized below will be sustained if ABP  initiatives will find continued uses: Government staff and organizations ABP has supported Government staff of the implementing partners to enhanced knowledge through  the training events arranged, through study tours to neighbor countries and through dialogue with  visitors from neighbors during their visits to ABP project sites.",positive,537
538,Government staffs have through TOT  x been equipped with required skills to extend and explain the content of ABP developed tools.,positive,538

540,Vertical and horizontal communication within ministries and in between has been eye openers useful  for future applications in ordinary working situations and within other projects.,positive,540
541," As a specific example  can be mentioned, that the cooperation with other agencies could contribute as technical service  providers. ",positive,541
542,The villagers in ABP target villages have learnt about the agro-biodiversity conservation issue and  knowledge. ,positive,542
543,"Interested villagers (model farmers) have been provided with opportunities to conserve  local plant varieties such as wild tae, fish conservation and Milentha for preservation and livelihood`s  improvement.",positive,543
544,Other villagers have observed and in discussions with the model farmers learnt which  techniques are feasible and under what conditions. ,positive,544
545,ABP was a first strategically important project dealing with integrating the biodiversity conservation in  land use policies.,positive,545
546,Accordingly ABP initiated a number of steps to concretize actions for mainstreaming  agro biodiversity conservation in land use policies and plans.,positive,546
547,The ARISE  project contributes to ILO objectives of promoting compliance with fundamental principles and rights at  work in the rural and urban informal economy as well as in enterprises and in global supply chains.,positive,547
548,The project approach and strategy mirrored the needs of all the project beneficiaries. ,positive,548
549,"Withdrawal of  children from labour and supporting them to fully reintegrate to formal schools, through support with  schooling materials and availability of catch up classes worked well to retain children in school. ",positive,549
550,Complementary Basic Education (CBE) offered in Community Based Service Outlet Centres (CBSOC)  and vocational skills training offered youth literacy and numeracy skills and avenues to earn a decent  living respectively. ,positive,550
551,Support with Income Generating Activities (IGAs) for parents was aimed at replacing  incomes from child labour and improving incomes for households to better protect their children.,positive,551
552,"This is  what all the parents, the team met, wished for. ",positive,552
553,"Further, the project was aligned and in tandem with  government plans and aspirations—Malawi Vision 2020, Malawi Growth and Development Strategy III  (MGDS III), Child Labour National Action Plan (NAP), Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) and  United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF). ",positive,553
554,The project benefited from lessons learnt in ARISE I. ,positive,554
555,The use of the IABA approach worked well in  concentrating interventions by different duty bearers and actors in a specific area in efforts to create a  child labour free zone.,positive,555
556,"The mix of partners, especially those at downstream level, was strategic and  enabled easy penetration into the community and across the project target groups",positive,556
557,"Partnership with  government led to quick and sustainable gains—the mainstreaming of child labour in the learning  curriculum, for instance.",positive,557
558,"Overall, the project goal, immediate objectives for the global ARISE II project and those for the Malawi  project, project outcomes, outputs, activities and indicators were clear and logically connected.",positive,558
559,The  design allowed for presentation of gender disaggregated data which was maintained in the reports.,positive,559
560,"From the findings, immediate objective 1 for Malawi was achieved.",positive,560
561,"This was evidenced by efforts to  develop and improve laws and policies—the child labour policy, the National Employment and Labour Policy (NELP) 2018, the HIV/AIDS workplace Policy and the NAP on trafficking in persons—mainstreaming of  child labour issues into the teaching curriculum and equipping teachers with Supporting Children’s Rights  through Education, Arts and Media (SCREAM) methodology skills to promote children participation in  eliminating child labour, and sensitising agricultural professionals and other stakeholders with requisite  knowledge on child labour among others. ",positive,561
562,These contributed to harmonizing government programmes  with the objectives of the NAP.,positive,562
563,"Similarly, the outcomes under this intervention led to an improved  regulatory framework and institutional development for the elimination of child labour, which was a pillar  in the ARISE global objectives. ",positive,563
564,"Although project reports5 , teachers and community members the team  spoke to, indicated that children previously in labour had enrolled back to school, lack of baseline values  denied the project to systematically measure the gains in this respect. ",positive,564
565,"Under the immediate objective 2 for Malawi, the capacity of different national and local authorities was  enhanced.",positive,565
566,Training of the CCLCs on identification of children in child labour and at risk of falling into child  labour was central in this objective as these continued to play their role in the community.,positive,566
567,"Establishment  of the CBSOCs, as one stop shops for withdrawn children, was strategic and worked well in equipping  youth with skills to earn a living.",positive,567
568,Those that the team met were happy to be earning better incomes in  better environments as compared to the time when they were in child labour.,positive,568
569,"Groups supported with IGAs portrayed immense potential for growth and some had already gained  significant mileage in expanding their venture—a pig rearing group in Msambo that had increased their  pigs from 4 to 21, for instance.",positive,569
570,The  awareness creation across the different stakeholders including the media set the basis for community  mobilisation in the elimination of child labour.,positive,570
571,This was  achieved through elaborate identification of children in labour and those at risk of falling into labour  through the use of the community based CLMS. ,positive,571
572,"Once identified, children would either be reintegrated  back to school or placed in the CBSOCs where they would be taught using the Community Based  Enterprise (CBE) to ensure they catch up with their peers in school once they get reintegrated.",positive,572
573,"Those  directly reintegrated benefited from afternoon classes established in 8 project target schools with the sole  purpose of ensuring that they receive remedial classes, so that they did not feel out of place due to poor  performance.",positive,573
574,"These interventions directly contributed to improvement in education services, which bear  the result of reduced child labour across the target communities. ",positive,574
575,Parents support with IGAs was aimed at giving parents an alternative income to support and maintain  children in school while vocational skills training for youth gave them an alternative source of livelihood  away from child labour.,positive,575
576,"The downstream efforts were complimented by upstream efforts to improve the  regulatory framework, leading to an integrated approach.",positive,576
577,The management arrangements for the ILO component were well coordinated with the project receiving  technical backstopping from the Geneva FUNDAMENTALS team and Decent Work Team (DWT) in  Pretoria.,positive,577
578,"Notably, regular meetings between the ILO and Implementing Partners (IPs)  x improved coordination of activities.",positive,578
579,"Going by the overall gains registered by ARISE II, it is evident that the project has been able to meet its  aspirations—contribute to the elimination of all worst forms of child labour in agricultural  communities in Malawi by 2018. ",positive,579
580,"Also, the combination of the different interventions ‘contributed to  elimination of all worst forms of child labour in agricultural communities in Malawi’ which is the  development objective for the project as evidenced in the findings presented above. ",positive,580
581,"On the whole, it can be concluded that the three projects made solid progress towards their  planned results as these are specified in the three different Results-Based Management (RBM)  systems in the Project Documents (PRODOC).",positive,581
582,"Nevertheless, the large number of important achievements  provided in Section 3.1 leads to the conclusion that the intervention progress has been very  substantial, with the exception of progress made in Lao PDR where much less activities took  place than in Cambodia and Myanmar.",positive,582
583,"On the one hand, the majority of beneficiaries of the social security funds are female, specific  social security measures are directed at women only, and in the tourism sector a substantial 30%  of Master Trainers/Assessors is female, while overall the participation of women in the workforce  especially in government organisations is quite widespread.",positive,583
584,"The ILO/Korea project contributed substantially to policy formulation in Cambodia especially  through its support to the National Employment Policy (NEP), but less so in Myanmar although  the setting up of the National Tripartite Dialogue Forum (NTDF) by the ILO Liaison Office (LO) is  an important step towards this goal.",positive,584
585,"In all countries there are clear connections between the three  projects and the respective Decent Work Country Programme’s, DWCP (see Annex 7). ",positive,585
586,"The  ILO/Korea project also contributed substantially to capacity building in Cambodia and to a lesser  extent in Myanmar, while it was in particular appreciated by many stakeholders to learn-while- working together with experts, consultants, staff, etc.",positive,586
587,"The Government Organisations (GO) interviewed in the different CLM countries plus Vietnam  (CLMV) are generally very satisfied with the quality of the specific outputs in the projects and have  clearly used the tools and practices developed, and this applies even to Vietnam where the project  was terminated in late 2017.",positive,587
588,"The ILO/Korea projects have generally more focussed on the GO  than on Employers’ Organisations (EO) or Workers’ Organisations (WO), although they have  clearly participated in selected activities, and sometimes even took the lead in certain activities  under the ILO/Korea projects. ",positive,588
589,"For the CLMV countries and/or the region of the Association of South East Asian Nations  (ASEAN) the support provided through this partnership is quite important, not only for the  countries involved and for the region, but also for the progress made in the different areas  supported.",positive,589
590,"In view of the substantial number of achievements made by the three projects, it is not surprising  that the main project counterparts are generally very satisfied with the support received by ILO  and the Republic of Korea (ROK).",positive,590
591,The long-standing partnership contributes to this feeling of  satisfaction as does the continuity in the activities undertaken over several partnership periods. ,positive,591
592,The Government Organisations in all four countries are generally satisfied with the  Management Arrangements.,positive,592
593,"The Programme Framework was revised following the 2013 evaluation of the partnership and this  led to a more efficient allocation of resources in the current phase by changing from an annual to  a three-year budget cycle, and by a more focussed approach (i.e. less geographically scattered  and more thematically focused) which was appreciated by most stakeholders. ",positive,593
594,"The involvement of the EO and WO in the activities of the  ILO/Korea partnership has differed between the three projects, but generally they have been  involved in the implementation of projects through tripartite fora, for example the Regional Skills  Technical Working Group (RSTWG), based in Bangkok, the National Social Security Fund  (NSSF) in Cambodia, the National Skills Standards Authority (NSSA), the Social Security Board  (SSB) and the National Tripartite Dialogue Forum (NTDF) all in Myanmar, as well as the Lao  National Advisory Chamber for TVET and Skill Development; and sometimes they have been  involved also more directly, such as their participation in Myanmar in developing the Law on  Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) from the beginning, the cooperation between the  Myanmar Engineering Society and the Asian Welding Federation (AWF), and the involvement of  WO in the OSH awareness campaign of the Factories and General Labour Laws Inspection  Department (FGLLID) of the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population (MOLIP) in Myanmar.",positive,594
595,"Generally, the delivery of core services and the communication with ILO were considered effective  by the main stakeholders.",positive,595
596,The contributions of the lead specialists and the experts of the ILO  Decent Work Technical Support Team (DWT) were considered of good quality. ,positive,596
597,"The two Korean experts on loan from the Korean Partner Institutions, COMWEL and  KOSHA, were involved in particular in different capacity building activities which have been  appreciated very much by the stakeholders.",positive,597
598,"All stakeholders interviewed agreed that the ILO/Korea projects clearly delivered value for money,  and that the resources have been allocated strategically and efficiently to achieve the intended  results.",positive,598
599,The resource use has been judged as quite efficient especially also compared to a  relatively limited budget per project per country.,positive,599
600," In addition, cost-sharing with other projects has  been considered as positive. ",positive,600
601,"On the whole, therefore, the key stakeholders are positive on the  delivery of value for money, and they indicated that more resources are indeed needed, and  specific proposals have been made by the respective counterparts in the three projects (see  Section 3.3).",positive,601
602,"Concerning costs involved to enhance gender equality, this does not seem a major issue, as most  of the efforts involved persuading women to join in project activities which they mainly seem to  have done without hesitation.",positive,602
603," In addition, an important gender issue was the composition of the  membership of the NSSF in Cambodia and the SSB in Myanmar; in both cases, the majority of  the 1.4 million and 1.15 million respectively were women, which is the more important since  international research studies have indicated that women spend much of their income on the  immediate needs of the entire family than men tend to do.",positive,603
604,Various strategies have been put in place in Cambodia and Myanmar to ensure the continuation  of mechanisms/tools/practices provided by the projects once the support from the project ends  (‘exit strategy’).,positive,604
605,"While in Lao  much less activities were implemented systematically, it contrasts with Vietnam which can be  considered as a case in point of sustainability as the government is in the process of integrating  the products of the partnership after the ILO exited. ",positive,605
606,"On the whole, the ILO/Korea projects do concern a real Partnership Approach in  the sense that the multi-country approach enhances working together and learning together, with  a focus on knowledge sharing.",positive,606
607,The three projects are considered by many stakeholders as relevant and very timely in the current  state of development of their respective countries.,positive,607
608,"The overall impression acquired during the  interviews is that the Government Organisations, in particular but not exclusively the ministries of  labour, have taken clear ownership of the activities implemented under the ILO/Korea partnership. ",positive,608
609,"With respect to the employers’ and workers’ organisations, this is generally much less the case,  although especially the EO have shown ownership in selected activities as discussed in the  above. ",positive,609
610,"In conclusion, therefore, the three projects have been very effective in establishing and  fostering national ownership among GO, but much less so among EO and in particular among  WO.",positive,610
611,All (40 of 40) interview groups felt PRD’s community awareness-raising and  mobilisation work was relevant to current community needs. ,positive,611
612,Nearly half of the community members interviewed had been involved in  the planning and design of activities.,positive,612
613,PRD activities are generally aligned with the traditional comparative  advantages of Consortium members.,positive,613
614,82% of interviewees felt that the community empowerment component of  the project has been effective.,positive,614
615,"However, PRD has  also been facilitated by a couple of significant enabling factors, the most  important of which has been strong civil society participation.",positive,615
616,83% of interviewees think that results thus far can be sustained.,positive,616
617,"PRD has a strong focus on ensuring a conflict sensitive approach and has  established both formal and informal mechanisms to investigate,  understand, and monitor sensitivities in areas where it works.",positive,617
618,"Internal Labour  Standards, however, are directly addressed in the programme.",positive,618
619,PRD is strongly aligned to the empowerment needs expressed by communities. ,positive,619
620,It is also aligned to the priorities of the EU.,positive,620
621,"The  exception is activities under SO3 which appear to have the highest chance for  sustainability, in part due to the strong design addressing sustainability from the outset.",positive,621
622,"PRD has had a strong focus on ensuring a  conflict sensitive approach and has succeeded in establishing mechanisms to investigate,  understand, and monitor sensitivities in areas where it works.",positive,622
623,"Emerging Good Practice: The “community infrastructure projects” under SO 3 stand out as a  particularly well designed activity that promotes the use of local labour and resources; carefully  considers conflict-sensitivity, gender, and sustainability issues; and helps provide incentives and  “entry points” to establish relationships and pursue more sensitive activities under SOs 1 and 2.",positive,623
624,"The project successfully applied the strategies of coordination, harmonisation and  capacity strengthening",positive,624
625,The timeframe of 3 years was sufficient to complete the objective of enhancement of  GOB enforcement of fire and general building safety laws and regulations,positive,625
626,Other stakeholder initiatives were taken into consideration although there was some  overlap with the RMGP which was managed during implementation,positive,626
627,Results based design was used although no actions were planned to enable workers to  play a role in promoting OSH (as this was not within the scope of the project),positive,627
628,However the  overall approach was a sustainable one.,positive,628
629,A major achievement is the harmonising of standards.,positive,629
630,The main unplanned output is a communication strategy and the projects switch in  emphasis from DIFE to FSCD because of overlap with the RMGP.,positive,630
631,Costs of outputs were considered cost efficient.,positive,631
632,"Good support was received from the ILO RMGP, CO & Geneva. ",positive,632
633,The project responded to the needs of the primary beneficiaries and the overall outcomes  are relevant.,positive,633

639,The No. of inspectors has increased.,positive,639
640,Recommendations made in the USDOL mid-term evaluation have been adequately  addressed by the project.,positive,640
641,However the tripartite role of the project in  bringing about consensus is appreciated.,positive,641
642,"The project, collaborating with RMGP, has demonstrated good practice in developing  a system for carrying out preliminary assessments and subsequent steps.",positive,642
643,"Managed from ILO Geneva, the project had global, national and migration corridor  focused elements under a strong gender and workers rights focus. ",positive,643
644,The GAP-MDW project fits with ILO initiatives such as the ILO office wide Decent Work for  Domestic Workers Strategy; the ILO Fair Migration Agenda; and the ILO Fair Recruitment  Initiative. ,positive,644
645,"Four technical departments (MIGRANT, INWORK, SAP/FL and ACTRAV) at ILO  headquarters were involved.",positive,645
646,It aligned with two Outcomes of the Programme and  Budget 2012-15. ,positive,646
647,The International Domestic Workers Federation (IDWF) was an associate of the project and  they developed a global electronic knowledge platform.,positive,647
648,"Another associate was the International  Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) who launched the ‘12 by 12’ campaign in partnership with  IDWF/IUF and others, and with IDWF host the ‘My Fair Home’ campaign.",positive,648
649,"Operationally the GAP-MDW project linked to projects that worked on combating trafficking  or safe migration (such as the ASEAN Triangle project, the GMS Triangle Project, PROWD,  Work in Freedom) and worked closely with UN Women in Argentina.",positive,649
650,In fact UN Women and  OHCHR were official partners to the project along with the trade union KSBSI in Indonesia.,positive,650
651,"The  strong collaboration with and between ITUC and IDWF, and the technical assistance provided  to IDWF to support their founding congress were effective for global strategies to improve the  organization of MDWs.",positive,651
652,"Many regional, bi national and tri national workshops took place in  the 5 migration corridors and beyond, to develop strategies, build alliances and move forward  the agenda for domestic workers. ",positive,652
653,"An inter-regional knowledge-sharing workshop in  Madagascar was reported as particularly effective with ILO playing an excellent facilitating  role amongst constituents and others, and an emphasis on labour agreements between  regions and countries. ",positive,653
654,"These events allowed for countries to learn from each other, and to  understand the international context under which MDWs are placed.",positive,654
655,National stakeholders  also used research findings to strengthen their engagement with government. ,positive,655
656,For example a  study contributed to discussions around lowering this age ban in Nepal. ,positive,656
657,"Another achievement was the quantitative statistical module included in the Zimbabwe  Labour Force Survey, which provided a detailed profile of the flows of migrant workers. ",positive,657
658,"A range of information guides, newsletters, booklets,  and 4 videos (one through OHCHR) were produced.",positive,658
659,Notably both the ITUC-IDWF-ILO guide for  collective bargaining and the information ‘passports’ (for domestic workers as they travel)  were reported to provide useful and practical information.,positive,659
660,"When disseminated and widely  referenced in other initiatives, these tools should continue to enhance awareness of social  partners so they can advocate for MDWs.",positive,660
661,"The three vocational training skills manuals  developed in Argentina to professionalize workers who care for the elderly, children and  housework are operational, and are already being further adapted for migrants in refugee  situations, and will be piloted in 2017 in Jordan, Lebanon and in Egypt.",positive,661
662,"In Argentina, with new legislation passed in 2015, it was reported  that a relatively higher number of MDWs enrolled for social security. ",positive,662
663,"However in Lebanon, innovative pilots were put in  place with bank employees, which are expanding further through ILO projects currently under  negotiation.",positive,663
664,"In Malaysia, a code of conduct was developed through a consultative process  with employers, and launched in March 2016.",positive,664
665,Research in South Africa and Malaysia also  provided useful insights on how employers view MDWs. ,positive,665
666,"In Argentina, employers were  encouraged to register their domestic workers. ",positive,666
667,"Generally, with some exceptions questionnaire respondents for the evaluation were positive  about the GAP-MDW project, considering activities to be worthwhile, and mentioning those  they particularly appreciated. ",positive,667
668,"Many stakeholders interviewed were appreciative of the  support from the EU, which allowed for a spotlight MDWs via ILO and partners. ",positive,668
669,"In line with ILO’s mandate, the GAP-MDW project strove to reach MDWs through partners,  encouraging trade unions to represent this category of worker with IDWF reaching out  through their electronic platform.",positive,669
670, For example SADSAWU in South Africa are pioneering approaches to reach  more migrants.,positive,670
671,Another approach was building the capacity of domestic  workers unions.,positive,671
672,"In conclusion, the GAP-MDW project allowed for an exclusive opportunity to research and  focus on the migrant domestic workers domain.",positive,672
673,"If disseminated widely, and packaged in  discrete policy briefs, the Global Report on Migrant Domestic Workers will be significant for  driving policy advice and change, as it draws on many experiences across the globe.",positive,673
674,The need for a focus on MDWs  themselves has been fully recognised as the most sustainable approach for collective action  to build advocacy approaches.,positive,674
675,The relevance of the Community Stabilisation Programme (CSP) is confirmed by this  evaluation throughout the three phases. ,positive,675
676,"All interviewees, including beneficiaries, praised  the CSP programme in that it responds to a top priority. ",positive,676
677,"The CSP programme has made improvements over the three phases, while maintaining the  same implementation modalities.",positive,677
678,The initial programme design and implementation was relevant to the needs of the target  population. ,positive,678
679,CSP is implemented in every municipality that has a significant minority  population and is valued by authorities at local level.,positive,679
680,CSP is relevant to both non-displaced minorities and returnees as it addresses two  essential drivers of stabilisation: access to essential services and livelihood.,positive,680
681,"CSP provides a  strong contribution to viable and qualitative return, especially in support of the EU- Return and Reintegration Kosovo programme. ",positive,681
682,"Given that there are few other projects operating in the municipalities where minorities form a  significant presence, the relevance of CSP is even greater.",positive,682
683,All MOCRs interviewed pointed  out that cooperation with IOM is exceptional and that CSP implementation is a model of  intervention. ,positive,683
684,"CSP Community projects have allowed municipalities to improve and create new amenities  for all community members (often multi-ethnic in nature) and have supported a wide range  of social, educational, cultural and environmentally relevant interventions. ",positive,684
685,CSP individual grants have contributed to the preservation of traditional cultural activities  and business practices which existence is otherwise at risk of disappearing. ,positive,685
686,The targeting is relevant and inclusive: The beneficiary assessment and selection process is closely involving local institutions from the very beginning.,positive,686
687,This process is thorough and  qualitative and ensures both inclusivity of vulnerable candidates while retaining only those  with adequate capacity and verified willingness to succeed.,positive,687
688,"The Criteria are important and relevant, however, the right targeting requires experience and  case-by-case evaluation. ",positive,688
689,The value of assistance is relevant though flexibility is required. ,positive,689
690,"The distribution of CSP I, II, III resources has been fairly balanced among ethnic groups and  geographic locations.",positive,690
691,The CSP programme has demonstrated a remarkable level of effectiveness: 100% of  beneficiaries visited are effectively running stable business and 100% of community  projects are regularly used by the communities. ,positive,691
692,"CSP has produced verifiable, durable and substantially positive changes in the lives of  vulnerable minority communities. ",positive,692
693,Start-up businesses are generating a livelihood for the  individual families despite challenging business/trade environment. ,positive,693
694,The inclusive cooperation applied by IOM with key central and local-level partners in the  implementation of both CSP and RRK creates greater effectiveness. ,positive,694
695,"CSP has learned from  and improved the implementation over time, developing innovative support such as  community businesses.",positive,695
696,The future of CSP improvement is to be inspired from IOM project  team’s wealth of field experience and knowledge. ,positive,696
697,"CSP coordination & cooperation have been very effective at the Strategic level between  EU, MCR and IOM. ",positive,697
698,This has facilitated the Operational level collaboration that has been  equally performing. ,positive,698
699,CSP efficiency is strong as CSP I & II have exceeded objectives both quantitatively and  qualitatively. ,positive,699
700,CSP III is also on the way to reaching objectives.,positive,700
701,"Efficiency is, on the first place, owed to human performance: The same CSP staffs are  there from day one: individual and team dedication, professional attitudes are the ingredients  without which no such results could be achieved. ",positive,701
702,"There appear to be no better cost-effective alternative to the current CSP implementation as  its success is the result of the quality of beneficiary selection, assessment, monitoring and  support.",positive,702
703,But this is the price of  success.,positive,703
704,The effective coordination of CSP activities at central and local level has certainly contributed  to the efficiency of implementation. ,positive,704
705,The permanent field presence of CSP team is a strong  element of efficiency as it did provide essential monitoring of and support to beneficiaries.,positive,705
706,"Having one implementing partner for all CSP phases proven a far more efficient choice  than various implementing agencies as the same individuals who have built experience,  knowledge, trust and close cooperation have stayed on from CSP I. ",positive,706
707,"CSP field-intensive approach is efficient and ensures quality of beneficiary assessment, and  selection.",positive,707
708,Calls for Individual Project proposals are ensuring an effective outreach to minority  communities in need. ,positive,708
709,Impact is strong quantitatively (with CSP objectives exceeded) but also qualitatively with  CSP often been referred to as the “best project”. ,positive,709
710,"Indirect impact is also impressive, as CSP has provided a vital link between  beneficiaries to facilitate their business prospects where beneficiaries can produce and sell  their produce to appropriate markets, including international markets. ",positive,710
711,The formal  registration of businesses has played a key role in establishing beneficiaries as credible  private sector actors. ,positive,711
712,CSP and partners have provided real solutions for families and helped to create an  environment more conducive to return. ,positive,712
713,Impact is maximised when combined with RRK  IG or DRC assistance for returnees and when combined with Municipal funds for Community  Projects.,positive,713
714,Sustainability is very strong and has been witnessed by the evaluators.,positive,714
715,"Different levels of sustainability are observed across small businesses:  • “Essential” businesses: Stable and generate, sufficient income to cover essential  needs plus some savings. ",positive,715
716,"“Solid” business: Business generating steady income, covering all essential needs  plus profit. ",positive,716
717,“High potential” businesses: Business” with high expansion potential. ,positive,717
718,"CSP has created strong opportunities for minority communities to enjoy the following rights,  in an effective, visible and measurable manner:  • Rights to employment ",positive,718
719,All female-run businesses are running strongly and performing outstandingly: They are  performing strongly and have placed women on equal ground with men. ,positive,719
720,IOM has actually been addressing the integration or re-integration challenge through its RRK  programme and the stabilisation challenge through CSP.,positive,720
721,SP Returnee business has proven  equally successful to non-displaced beneficiaries.,positive,721
722,"ith 100% of successful returnee and  8  IDP beneficiaries, CSP has proven its capacity to adjust to a more vulnerable target group  while helping return and reintegration programme in achieving sustainable objectives.",positive,722
723,CSP programme design has clearly taken into account the impact on the environment that  projects may have. ,positive,723
724,Small business owners have developed practices respective of  environment and healthy (with the production of organic food).,positive,724
725,Visibility is strong.,positive,725
726,“Invisible visibility” has proven very efficient at the field level through  to the “word-of-mouth” with beneficiaries acting as ambassadors of CSP in their community.,positive,726
727,IPA provides the most relevant tool in that context in that it outlines very clearly the Kosovo  Government and EU-support Kosovo priorities. ,positive,727
728,There is a strong coherence of CSP with all relevant existing strategies both from the  EU and the MCR side.,positive,728
729,"CSP has been designed to fully support all Kosovo Government  strategies (MCR strategy 2014-2018) and EU policies (Indicative Strategy Paper 2014- 2020), especially with regards to minority rights and stabilisation. ",positive,729
730,The strength and scale of CSP results and impact is closely connected to the fact that it has  been a one programme and one agency continued effort from the very beginning. ,positive,730
731,The evaluation found the CSP job creation to be a very cost-effective operation.,positive,731
732,"This is even  more the case when considering that, in the isolated context of minority communities, a CSP  individual business means much more than a job created. ",positive,732
733,"Even though it is not formalised yet as such, CSP has developed a model, shaped over a long  continuous learning and improvement process. ",positive,733
734,"However, prior to establishing CSP as a  model, the immense field practice knowledge needs to be captured.",positive,734
735,"Otherwise, there is a risk  of this knowledge being lost when individual leave the organisation. ",positive,735
736,"The strong impact of CSP, verified over eight years is a strong basis for this intervention to be  qualified as a model.",positive,736
737,"As explained in the previous recommendation, there is a lot to gain from  modelling CSP as a model relevant to inclusive employment for isolated communities in the  context of Kosovo, and potentially in elsewhere in Western Balkans countries.",positive,737
738,CSP-support business run by women have performed very strongly and they have provided  concrete opportunities to promote the role and perception of women as capable  businesspersons. ,positive,738
739,"In a country featuring the highest employment gender gap in Europe, and  where employment generated through small businesses are a rare opportunity, CSP needs to  provide more options to women by including them in a larger proportion of CSP  beneficiaries. ",positive,739
740,CSP decision to award a second grant (not within the same CSP phase) to business with a  strong potential has proven relevant and positive. ,positive,740
741,"Job creation categories: The nature of the jobs created by CSP is a crucial indicator, to  describe the impact of CSP",positive,741
742,CSP has helped create hundreds of business and jobs that are knowingly stable.,positive,742
743,The evaluation has visited some exceptional minority business and believes those are great  stories to promote and increase the visibility of CSP. ,positive,743
744,CSP business have impressed for they have set environmentally friendly practices that have  contributed to strengthen the value chain.,positive,744
745,"In some cases, they have even set informally new  environmental standards and raised awareness with their organic food production. ",positive,745
746,"The success of CSP has a regional dimension in that it contributes to solving the regional  issue of displacement, return and reintegration.",positive,746
747,"Thus, the promotion of the CSP model, if  supported with funds adequate to the needs, can be a positive driver of regional stabilisation  of communities. ",positive,747
748,CSP public call for business grant application have raised a very strong interest and produced  a high number of applications.,positive,748
749,Changing  the implementing agency and its staff could seriously jeopardize the trust and cooperation  built so far and the future results of CSP. ,positive,749
750,"The project was found to be relevant, focusing on engagement with the knowledge- based diaspora to support the economic development efforts in the country, which is an  ongoing priority of the Government of Ethiopia (GoE). ",positive,750
751,"The project was also found to be  moderately effective, mostly or partially achieving all its outcomes and outputs through  stakeholder meetings and the production of evidence-based research.",positive,751
752,"However, the project was able to  provide the GoE with a mapping survey, a skills/knowledge gap report of local  institutions and a road map for future action.",positive,752
753,"It also produced a database of 400  diaspora organisations in the United States (US) for consultation, which is currently in  use by the GoE.",positive,753
754,"Further, a strengthened commitment towards diaspora engagement by  the GoE was witnessed during the project’s timeframe although this could not be wholly  attributed to the project results. ",positive,754
755,Within these very difficult circumstances the project was managed efficiently with regular  reporting every six months although the significant reduction in financial scope for some  activities was not mentioned in the reporting. ,positive,755
756,"The project was found to be relevant to the priorities of the GoE, complementing its effort  to implement its Diaspora Policy and engage the Ethiopian diaspora to support the  economic development of the country. ",positive,756
757,"The project was found to be effective, partially or mostly achieving all its outcomes and  outputs through stakeholder meetings and the production of evidence-based research. ",positive,757
758,"However, project participants agreed on the  usefulness of the project results and demonstrated evidence of a strengthened  commitment towards diaspora engagement. ",positive,758
759,The project was managed efficiently in challenging circumstances.,positive,759
760,The  results achieved were found to be proportionate to the costs expended. ,positive,760
761,The short-term results of the project were strong although limited by the reduced  scope of the project,positive,761
762,"The new database produced from the mapping exercise has  already been used by the GoE for diaspora engagement purposes, and the project as a  whole has formed the basis for a joint GoE and IOM proposal. ",positive,762
763," If the research project outputs (the reports) are  considered as a pilot from which a larger mapping and needs assessment can be  developed, this has the potential for longer-term impact, but will depend upon the next  stage of the project being developed. ",positive,763
764,The project was assessed as having a sustainability score of 3 based on its dependence  upon funding for related proposals on diaspora engagement be developed.,positive,764
765,"The research  outputs have produced valuable information which can be used to support diaspora  engagement projects using data collected from three US states and the health and  education sectors sampled within the country, but this is limited.",positive,765
766,"However, changes in  the external environment such as the establishment of the Diaspora Agency and  Diaspora Trust Fund indicate a prioritization from the GoE in engagement with the  diaspora and could support the sustainability of the project results such as the roadmap if further attention is given to it. ",positive,766
767,"The project was found to be relevant and relatively effective, adapting to a very difficult  political context to partially or mostly achieve its outcomes, outputs and activities. ",positive,767
768,"However, overall the project results were considered as very useful by the majority of  stakeholders, particularly within the current context in which the GoE has prioritized its  interest in diaspora engagement.",positive,768
769,"The production of evidence-based research supported an improved understanding of the relevance of diaspora mapping to designing diaspora  engagement strategies and produced a roadmap, which if adopted can contribute  towards feeding into knowledge and skill transfer programmes to be designed in the  future. ",positive,769
770,The project also produced a database of diaspora organisations which is  currently being used for engagement purposes and a springboard for two other  proposals currently being developed with the GoE aimed at diaspora engagement.,positive,770
771,Portal content is in alignment with the original intent to facilitate access to migration data and provide capacity building tools. ,positive,771
772,The current Portal content aligns well to target user needs and expectations as identified during conceptualization. ,positive,772
773,"It provides a one-stop-shop for migration data that is overall useful, comprehensive, timely, and reliable.",positive,773
774,Visits to the Portal have been steadily increasing since its launch in December 2017 with the most visited sections being Data and Themes.,positive,774
775,Most of those surveyed or interviewed appear to be finding the content they are looking for on the Portal.,positive,775
776,"As for user satisfaction with the content, overall again it appears that there is a high degree of satisfaction among the users.",positive,776
777,The Portal is perceived to be very useful overall.,positive,777
778,Only 3% of those surveyed or interviewed found the Portal was not useful at all.,positive,778
779,This is especially positive given that they are among the key target groups.,positive,779
780,A majority of those surveyed and interviewed (53%) report that they are using the Portal. ,positive,780
781,"Overall, the project maintained its relevance to identified needs of the GoE. ",positive,781
782,It was also clearly  consistent with IOM priorities and mandate. ,positive,782
783,"On the  one hand, the project has produced a number of quality outputs and outcomes. ",positive,783
784,"Chief among these  are the updated and formally endorsed NS and NAP (though not planned for); a well-organized and  informative Study Visit to Belgium; comprehensive and largely effective trainings to scores of law  enforcement officers, media professionals, and CSOs’ staff; a comprehensive and intensive  awareness-raising and media campaign with clear and strong messages tailored to the target audience;  and, created a conducive working environment for the NCCTIP&PIM’s Technical Secretariat  through refurbishing its premises and providing the Secretariat with considerable resources. ",positive,784
785,The project also showed an efficient utilization of financial resources and a successful strategy in  synergizing and complementing interventions of other development partners and leveraging non- project resources. ,positive,785
786,Perhaps the most notable impact of the project are the updated and formally endorsed NS and NAP;  both represent major contribution to the GoE’s efforts in combating trafficking in persons.,positive,786
787,"The project has also imparted improved knowledge of the complex and multi- faceted issue of trafficking in persons and the current legal framework in Egypt, as well as the NS  and NAP, among scores of law enforcement officers, media professionals, and CSOs’ staff. ",positive,787
788,The Study  Visit was very informative and is reported to have contributed to the signing of the protocol for the  establishment of a shelter for victims of trafficking.,positive,788
789,Strong indications are such that the awareness- raising and media campaign was quite successful and delivered effective messages specifically tailored  to the needs and socio-economic-political backgrounds of the diverse array of targeted groups. ,positive,789
790,The formal endorsement of the NS and NAP has secured their sustainability.,positive,790
791,"The protocol for  establishing a shelter for VoTs is in itself a milestone, though it remains to be operationalized.",positive,791
792,"Unintended as it may have been, the direct link and strong working relationship between  NCCTIP&PIM and media outlets that resulted from training media professional continues to serve  the committee’s efforts in raising awareness of and publicizing the issues of trafficking in persons. ",positive,792
793,The premises of the NCCPIT&PIM’s Secretariat are in good condition,positive,793
794,"However, the assumption underlying the project design  – that VoTs would benefit from the strengthened prevention and protection framework in the country, as a result of the project – is plausible but dependent on fulfilling this assumption.",positive,794
795,"Relevance: The project is relevant as it addresses the existing weak border  management, enhanced coordination and collaboration between South Africa and  Lesotho in various trans-border criminal issues including the counter trafficking and  smuggling.",positive,795
796,It is also compliant with local and international policies and goals.,positive,796
797,All key  informants reported that the project is relevant and it addressed the needs of  Lesotho and the people of Lesotho. ,positive,797
798,Effectiveness: The project was effective as it has reached most of the targets as per  result matrix within the set timeframe with key project results being achieved. ,positive,798
799,Efficiency: The project was efficiently implemented both in terms of operations and  financially. ,positive,799
800,"Operationally, it was implemented in collaboration with MoHA and a  contracted NGO, and the budget was used efficiently within the approved time  frame.",positive,800
801,"Impact: While impact cannot be seen at the time of evaluation (as of December 2018  - at the end of the project implementation), it is assumed that combination of the  capacity building training, implementation of the Immigration SOP, and the use of  donated items will lead to the impact after few years.",positive,801
802,"Sustainability: The project was implemented jointly with Home Affairs, which  enhanced their ownership to ensure sustainability of the project.",positive,802
803,The government  showed political will to support the project and made commitment to include the  3 project interventions in next year’s budget.,positive,803
804,"Due to that willingness, it has made an  executive decision that the installed CCTVs in both borders will be the responsibility  of LRA as is the case in other border posts where they are available.",positive,804
805,Many informants recognised the advantage of having an  international non-governmental organisation (INGO) as co-chair of the SC.,positive,805
806,"The shelter response in the Governmental-Controlled Area (GCA), has been mostly well targeted  and appropriate, supported by the SC coordination services. ",positive,806
807,"The SC has been described as the  most effective cluster in Ukraine, with a highly valued information management (IM) system and  country-wide mapping processes.",positive,807
808,"The SC has also led technical working groups (TWIG),  particularly on shelter winterisation and cash assistance which were essential for harmonising  and standardising the shelter response.",positive,808
809,Monitoring of cash for shelter activities have shown high  levels of beneficiary satisfaction with the programme.,positive,809
810,"A number of actors based in the field, including UNHCR, have been running informal shelter  meetings to better coordinate shelter operations.",positive,810
811,Key SC personnel were fulfilling dual responsibilities for the SC and UNHCR until April 2015.,positive,811
812,"SC meetings (SCM) have been responding to the needs of SC partners through regular meetings  in Kyiv and ad-hoc regional coordination meetings until the activation of the sub-national hub in  July 2015, based in Sloviansk.",positive,812
813,The SC Team (SCT) led a number of technical working groups (TWIGs) which were very well  received by SC partners.,positive,813
814,"These documents have enabled agencies to develop advocacy messages to  donors, government and their head-quarters.",positive,814
815,"A post-distribution monitoring (PDM) template, for  cash assistance developed by the SC, contributed to consistency in agency reporting and  improved transparency and accountability vis-à-vis the affected population.",positive,815
816,"Overall, the SC has been valued for the information it produces. ",positive,816
817,"The SCT has provided capacity building for SC partners, including national non-governmental  organisations (NNGOs) through various forums, TWIGs, SCM and individual ad-hoc meetings.",positive,817
818,"The  translation of meetings and key documents into English, Russian and Ukrainian has been essential  to allowing engagement with national actors.",positive,818
819,Overall the SC is perceived as one of the strongest and most relevant clusters of this response. ,positive,819
820,Every key informant highlighted the strength of the SC compared with other clusters in Ukraine.,positive,820
821,"The first of their kind, the pilots in both Cairo with Catholic Relief Services  (CRS) and Alexandria with Caritas presented an opportunity to adapt a proven methodology to the refugee  context in order to better respond to protection needs. ",positive,821
822,"The Mid-Term Evaluation has shown that current Programme interventions have realized positive impacts  to some extent in areas such as skills development, confidence building and communication abilities,  employment generation, business development and income levels.",positive,822
823,"Though of the gaps identified during the first half of project implementation in Cairo  and Alex, generally the graduation program is appreciated and needed for almost all refugees interviewed  and surveyed to improve their pathways to better lives.",positive,823
824,The average income earned per person per month increased by about 18% and 27% since joining the  Programme with CRS and Caritas respectively.,positive,824
825,"The programme has been able to improve the status of the  majority of the participants, lifting them out of ultra-poverty (i.e. earning nothing), and has supported some  participants to surpass the threshold of poverty by earning more than 1800 EGP per month.",positive,825
826,"For the wage-employment track (WET), 68% and 69% of jobs placement have been achieved by CRS and  Caritas respectively. ",positive,826
827,"For the SET, 78% and 97% have started up their business with support from CRS and Caritas respectively. ",positive,827
828,"However, the programme - specifically in Alexandria - has conducted excellent efforts to connect participants to the market through  exhibitions and fairs where they can sell their products; the programme should further capitalize on such  events that are run by Egyptians. ",positive,828
829,"The case management system and the caseworkers themselves are vital elements to support refugees in  their journey to self-reliance, and are generally seen as key to the success of any Graduation Programme. ",positive,829
830,"In the case of Egypt, a single refugee is served by more than one case worker including a socio-economic  case worker, an enterprise-based case worker and an employment-based case worker.",positive,830
831,This approach may  fragment the accountability towards achieving desired results and outcomes for refugees.,positive,831
832,"The programme has also engaged in re-development  of short-to-medium-term Project Key Performance Indicators to be more specific, time-bound and worth  measuring. ",positive,832
833,"UNHCR increasingly uses cash based interventions (CBIs) as a preferred modality for delivering  assistance, offering greater dignity and choice to Persons of Concern (PoCs) in line with  UNHCR’s core protection mandate.",positive,833
834,"In 2017 alone, UNHCR delivered US$150 million through  CBIs specifically aimed at achieving protection outcomes.",positive,834
835,"The GCA, which is led by  UNHCR, harmonised the different cash initiatives and programmes in Greece into one single  card, delivery mechanism and beneficiary database.",positive,835
836,MPGs contribute to protection outcomes throughout the continuum outlined in  the theory of change.,positive,836
837,"The evaluation found that the most highly  reported areas of spending among PoCs were in these areas, and that as such MPGs  were achieving this intended objective.",positive,837
838,The water needs (drinking and household use) of PoCs living in ESTIA-provided  accommodation are met as part of the comprehensive government response.,positive,838
839,"However,  for some of those families living in the camps, the provision of water is insufficient and  MPGs are used to supplement this need.",positive,839
840,"PoCs are able to access the Greek health system for free, and as such are supported in  meeting many of their acute and immediate health needs. ",positive,840
841,"Children are able to utilise the Greek education system for free, and MPGs facilitate  this access for many by allowing PoCs to purchase supplies and clothes necessary for  school, and pay for transport.",positive,841
842,"PoCs report that MPGs have helped them generate additional  sources of income by relieving them of their concerns with regard to meeting their  basic needs, and by providing the money required to purchase the necessary clothing  and pay for transport.",positive,842
843,"However, the provision of MPGs for basic  needs does appear to have contributed to wider protection outcomes by reducing the  employment of the extreme negative coping strategies seen at programme baseline.",positive,843
844,"The evaluation finds that less than one percent of survey participants reported having  to engage in dangerous or exploitative work, or send underage children to work, and  only three percent reported having to resort begging. ",positive,844
845,"MPGs contribute to PoCs feelings of safety in Greece, with 75 percent of respondents  stating that cash had contributed to their feeling of safety in some way.",positive,845
846,"In terms of  the most commonly cited reasons, 43 percent reported reduced tension at home, 42  percent reported reduced tension in community and 43 percent reported feeling safer  in the knowledge that their needs were covered.",positive,846
847,"Although the inherent lack of dignity associated with the displacement of a family or  household cannot be fully addressed through CBIs, MPGs are viewed by PoCs as a  dignified means of receiving assistance.",positive,847
848,Seventy five percent felt that it allowed them  to live with more dignity.,positive,848
849,"Commonly cited reasons were that they did not have to rely  on others for food, and that it allowed them to reduce their employment of coping  strategies.",positive,849
850,MPGs are the preferred modality of assistance for PoCs. ,positive,850
851,"When asked if cash allowed  them to make the best choices for their family, the majority of survey respondents  answered ‘somewhat’ or ‘moderately’.",positive,851
852,The reasons most regularly cited were that it  allowed them to choose their priority and preferred items.,positive,852
853,"Overall, MPGs do appear to contribute towards protection by supporting the integration  of PoCs with local communities and host populations, due in part to a monthly injection  of over €6 million into the local economy.",positive,853
854,"Not only do MPGs provide PoCs with the  opportunity to interact directly with locals when they go to shops to purchase food and  other non-food items, they also provide communities (particularly smaller and more rural  ones) with this vital injection of cash.",positive,854
855,This diminishes negative feelings and resentment  linked to perceptions that PoCs may receive more support than Greek nationals.,positive,855
856,MPGs were found to support PoC’s feelings of confidence and increased equality when  interacting with vendors.,positive,856
857,"Forty-four percent of PoCs agreed/strongly agreed that MPGs  had helped them feel more confident when interacting with host communities, and felt  they had contributed to increased feelings of equality with the host community.",positive,857
858,"The move towards comprehensive distribution of MPGs has been a contributing factor  to the achievement of protection outcomes, particularly when it comes to meeting  basic needs as blanket assistance simplifies the programme and allows increased  coverage. ",positive,858
859,"Freedom of movement within Greece allows PoCs the choice to remove themselves  from environments which pose a significant protection risk, as well as the freedom  to access markets and services, all of which contribute towards the achievement of  protection outcomes.",positive,859
860,"Various additional services, including supporting health and education services, are  available to many PoCs at no cost, which is a contributing factor to the achievement of  protection outcomes.",positive,860
861,"PoCs are entitled to health, pharmaceutical and hospital care free of charge on the same  terms as Greek citizens.",positive,861
862,"Free access to education enables children to continue their education and engage with  local children, thereby enhancing their ability to integrate. ",positive,862
863,"PoCs have access to the labour market as employees, or service/work providers, from  the moment their application has been formally lodged and they have received their  asylum seeker’s card.",positive,863
864,"PoCs are entitled to access adult education and vocational training in Greece, and  this theoretically allows PoCs the first step towards their engagement in livelihoods  activities.",positive,864
865,"MPGs can be viewed as an appropriate modality of assistance for PoCs in Greece  because the CBI programme design was based on needs and feasibility assessments,  the MPG transfer value was calculated based on the minimum expenditure basket, and  CBI programme activities have remained ‘protection based.",positive,865
866,"The design of the CBI programme ensures that MPGs were not only a viable, but  welcome, form of assistance for PoCs, NGOs and the government. ",positive,866
867,The decision to use  MPGs in Greece was based on needs and feasibility assessments conducted by both  UNHCR and a range of other NGOs operating in Greece.,positive,867
868,This decision ensured that  the protection risks facing PoCs at the onset of the crisis were minimised or completely  mitigated.,positive,868
869,"Ongoing advocacy for those PoCs who were initially ineligible has meant that,  over time, these groups are also being included into the programme, thereby increasing  the coverage of CBIs and ensuring protection for all.",positive,869
870,"The MPG transfer value was calculated based on the minimum expenditure basket,  and is sufficient to ensure that PoCs are able to meet their basic needs in the short- term, and as such is adequate to ensure protection within these parameters.",positive,870
871,MPGs also  allow PoCs the freedom and flexibility to begin covering their medium- and long-term  needs in most cases.,positive,871
872,The CBI programme in Greece worked closely with protection colleagues to ensure  that protection considerations were incorporated into all elements of the programme.,positive,872
873,"These initiatives include protection colleagues joining CBI programme activities and the  establishment of a cash helpline, and have ensured that protection cases are identified  and promptly referred, as well as ensuring the CBI programme remains appropriate to  the protection environment in Greece.",positive,873
874,"The design of the CBI programme was protection-focused, with activities appropriately  designed to ensure that the programme aligned with UNHCR’s protection mandate. ",positive,874
875,"The programme design provides blanket assistance to all eligible PoCs, thereby ensuring  high coverage.",positive,875
876,"In line with the objective of the CBI programme in Greece, MPGs are sufficient to allow  PoCs to meet their basic needs in terms of: food, WASH, non-food items including  shelter and clothing, health, and education.",positive,876
877,They also lead to a reduction in negative  coping strategies in some sectors.,positive,877
878,CBIs provide a first step towards social cohesion by: increasing purchasing capacity of  PoC populations; injecting cash into local economies; reducing the perception PoCs  as a ‘burden’ on the already stretched Greek social welfare state; and increasing the  opportunity of PoCs to interact with Greek nationals.,positive,878
879,"Despite noted challenges and areas for improvement, all sub-programmes were able to reach their  targets, and all were reported to be primarily relevant, impactful and effective.",positive,879
880,The programmes were well  supported by parents and youth who participated.,positive,880
881,"The success of the programmes is attributed to the  NACCW’s project management abilities, well-trained CYCWs, mentors, site managers, implementing  agents, partners, as well as the focus on the rights of children and youth, their caregivers and the  community. ",positive,881
882,Isibindi’s specialised approach has been internationally distinguished in  empowering children and young adults to become resilient participants of society.,positive,882
883,"By September 2018, the adolescent and youth programme had benefitted 31,167 young people over the  age of 14, which exceeded the initial target of 25,000.",positive,883
884,The Isibindi Adolescent and Youth Development Programme reached and exceeded most of the set  targets on effectiveness. ,positive,884
885,"Data collection illustrated that the effectiveness of the programme was directly  correlated to the quality of training provided by the NACCW, complemented by the dedication of the  CYCWs to deliver high quality basket of services to OVCY.",positive,885
886,"The support provided by the NACCW Mentors  and Senior Mentors was also integral to quality programme implementation, alongside the linkages  between home visits and Safe Parks, in enabling CYCWs to identify issues to be addressed among  adolescents, youth and households in need of support. ",positive,886
887,"Ninety Five percent (95%) of the project staff and main stakeholders (Project Managers and Site  Coordinators, CYCWs and YDFs, Mentors, Beneficiaries and Caregivers) indicated that the whole  programme was highly relevant and important for the needs of youth and adolescents, as well as for the  wider community.",positive,887
888,The whole programme was rated as highly valuable in strengthening familial  relationships across many households. ,positive,888
889,"The most relevant sub-components of the programme were the  Home Visits, Safe Parks, Radio Programme, MenCare Programme and the Sinovuyo Family Programme.",positive,889
890,"These sub-components were particularly relevant in addressing the needs and interests of youth,  caregivers and families, generating maximum interest and having a significant impact.",positive,890
891,"Based on the findings, the programme broadly made a positive impact in the lives of adolescents, youth,  caregivers and families. ",positive,891
892,"Dedicated and passionate Child and Youth Care Workers and Youth  Development Facilitators, who are supported by the NACCW mentors, primarily deliver the programme. ",positive,892
893,"Firstly, the home visits provided through Isibindi AYDP engendered behavioural change in terms of  instilling independence among adolescents and young people, enabling improved self-care, nutritional  intake and enhanced household problem solving and effective budgeting, which was particularly  important in strengthening the resilience of child-headed households. ",positive,893
894,"From the analysis of the data, it is evident that relationships between CYCWs, YDFs and beneficiaries  facilitated psycho-social support and mental wellbeing for at-risk or vulnerable children, youth and  adolescents.",positive,894
895,Confirmation was also received that the Safe Parks created a safe space for the  adolescents and especially the youth to engage in recreational activities and develop bonds with fellow  xv peers.,positive,895
896,"Tuition support provided at Safe Parks bolstered educational outcomes for children, youth and  adolescents, enabling improved matric pass rates, tertiary education access and employability prospects. ",positive,896
897,"Isibindi AYDP strengthened the lives of many young people, who consistently return to Safe Parks having  completed tertiary education to motivate other youth to continue with their studies. ",positive,897
898,"Youth empowerment  and life skills initiatives instilled improved understandings of sexual and reproductive health and rights  (SRHR), as well as how to access HIV testing and family planning. ",positive,898
899,"According to project staff and families  (CYCWs, Mentors, YDFs, project managers and site coordinators, beneficiaries and caregivers), the  knowledge imparted in the Adolescent and Youth Development Programme (AYDP) inter alia reduced  teenage pregnancies across all sites. ",positive,899
900,"Youth empowerment programmes, coupled with the MenCare programme for fathers and the Sinovuyo  element for parents, reduced incidents/instances of abuse and gender-based violence in the communities  within which Safe Parks were located.",positive,900
901,"Sinovuyo was evidently important in improving communication  channels between parents and children, while also emboldening caregivers to spend more quality time  with their children and speak more openly about sensitive issues.",positive,901
902,"MenCare was, in certain instances,  principally impactful in shifting harmful patriarchal values and empowering some men to engage in caring  for their wives and children as well as contributing to household chores.",positive,902
903,"The Youth Empowerment, MenCare and Sinovuyo programmes,  targeted gender equality at community level and this produced encouraging results.",positive,903
904,"Whereas young  women were empowered, men were sensitised about gender-based violence and equality issues. ",positive,904
905,"The Siyakhula Substance Abuse initiative provided early intervention and response to prevent and lessen  the harmful impact of substance abuse among children and youth, enabling rehabilitation, access and integration back into schools for youth who had dropped out. ",positive,905
906,"Regardless, a few  success cases of rehabilitation were reported.",positive,906
907,"The Radio Programme pilot initiative was exceptionally  impactful in facilitating youth empowerment and development, by providing a platform for youth to  express their ideas or concerns and concurrently interact with their local communities through the media  outlet.",positive,907
908,"This programme sub-component was thus acutely important in strengthening the self-esteem, self- confidence and employability prospects of the youth involved. ",positive,908
909,"The Isibindi AYDP has broadly generated a sustainable impact in terms of the behaviour and attitude shift  of beneficiaries, in cases where there was no cooperation and buy-in from the parents and youth. ",positive,909
910,"n  addition, a few specialised programmes have continued since the project was completed in September  2018.",positive,910
911,"Despite these challenges, the Safe Park programme hub will, depending on the availability of resources,  continue to fulfil the needs of beneficiaries and the community, remaining a safe place for children, youth  and adolescents to study, play and gather after school.",positive,911
912,"During data collection, all partners with whom UNICEF worked  directly to deliver the AYDP programme namely, NACCW, DSD, Clowns Without Borders and Sonke  Gender Justice, indicated that UNICEF functioned as a strong partnership in providing regular and timely  guidance and coordination of meetings, as well as fulfilling an effective oversight role. ",positive,912
913,"UNICEF facilitated effective coordination, funding allocation and the convening of partners, to deliver  optimal project management of the AYDP.",positive,913
914,Programmes are more successful if a multidisciplinary approach is adopted; ,positive,914
915,The ownership of the programmes by the entire community is of paramount importance; ,positive,915
916,"The strength of the initiative is that it brought different stakeholders together on the right of  education of the Syrian children, and UNICEF managed to mobilize resources and partnerships. ",positive,916
917,The Back to Learning initiative provided much needed support to the education sector in  terms of provision of supplies and light rehabilitation of the many crisis affected schools.,positive,917
918,"Over the  years management, coordination, and monitoring systems of the Back to Learning initiative have  continuously improved.",positive,918
919,UNICEFs position as co-lead of the education sector and its network of implementing partners  has enabled efficient coordination of the initiative.,positive,919
920,"The evaluation finds that overall, the population receives information about schooling directly from schools and the directorates of education and is aware of the benefits of education in general.",positive,920
921,It is time well invested to enhance the chances of learning systematically. ,positive,921
922,Monitoring the situation and relevance of the response and adjusting accordingly is essential  for making sure UNICEF addresses the needs of the affected population and build strong cases for  donor support.,positive,922
923,"The Back to Learning initiative is in line with national priorities, international commitments  and the priority of the Ministry of Education, and UNICEF.",positive,923
924,"Therefore, the overall initiative and in particular the rehabilitation  and provision of supplies were relevant and appropriate. ",positive,924
925,The education section led systematizing of the intervention has improved relevance within  the available political space. ,positive,925
926,The monitoring system was strengthened and integrated over time especially at the activity  and output levels.,positive,926
927,Coordination between different departments and integration of monitoring and analysis has  improved over the years and especially with the arrival of the information management officer. ,positive,927
928,Output level results have been largely achieved.,positive,928
929,UNICEF managed to reach children in identified vulnerable areas and supports them to go back to school.,positive,929
930,External coordination has been successful with the internal coordination having scope to  improve to harvest synergies between sections and partners. ,positive,930
931,"From July 2012 through July 2017, UNICEF provided  life-saving water and sanitation resources under these difficult conditions for approximately  400,0001 . ",positive,931
932,"In July 2012, UNICEF was the only organization in Jordan that had the resources, capacity,  and institutional commitment to take leadership of the WASH response related to the Syrian  refugee crisis.",positive,932
933,It expanded to include  services for water-deprived Jordanian host communities that were resource constrained  before the crisis and were further burdened by the crisis.,positive,933
934,The WASH programme’s scope also  grew to provide urgent WASH services for refugees living in the border settlements at  Hadalat and Rukban.,positive,934
935,"The emergency response required quick and flexible decision making  and efficient utilization of scarce resources, which UNICEF successfully performed. ",positive,935
936,"Overall however, the programme provided an effective response  in line with its core mission, providing life-saving WASH services in response to the Syrian  refugee crisis.",positive,936
937,It has also increased efficiency and worked to ensure coverage of vulnerable  populations.,positive,937
938,Two difficult achievements in a dynamic and complex environment.,positive,938
939,UNICEF dealt with these obstacles while implementing a  complex WASH programme and serving as a conscientious steward of its donors’ resources  and interests. ,positive,939
940,Relevance: In camps and settlements interventions were relevant and appropriate in terms of  meeting rapidly changing WASH needs of targeted populations under difficult circumstances. ,positive,940
941,"UNICEF maintained  programme relevance during the winter storms, outbreaks of illness, and other obstacles to  smooth management (such as trucker strikes) that arose throughout the 2012-2017 period. ",positive,941
942,"During 2012 and 2013, UNICEF determined needs by estimating the quantity of water,  sanitation services capacity, and numbers of facilities that people displaced by the Syrian  civil war required at transit centers and in Za’atari, King Abdullah Park and Cyber City. ",positive,942
943,"In  this period UNICEF designed and implemented water and sanitation service options and level  of services based on its analysis of the dynamic emergency response context, opinions of  partners and other stakeholders, and the resources it had available.",positive,943
944,UNICEF has made crucial improvements to water and wastewater infrastructure in host  communities and informal tented settlements. ,positive,944
945,"Effectiveness: In the provision of equitable WASH services and dissemination of WASH messages in the four camps, the WASH programme achieved high levels of effectiveness for  the targeted population across all years. ",positive,945
946,"The programme also very effectively supported the  WASH sector through technical support to the MoWI, as well as National WASH in School  Standards.",positive,946
947,"Government officials at the MoWI and WAJ reported satisfaction with the WASH  programme’s contribution to planning documents, strategies, and policies.",positive,947
948,UNICEF’s  achievement included successful coordination of the WASH sector from the camp to the  national level.,positive,948
949,The programme met its targets under each of these activity areas.,positive,949
950,Efficiency: The WASH programme worked continuously to improve the efficiency of its  operations. ,positive,950
951,"As an example, the evaluation team estimates that between 2013 and 2016, the  cost of delivering water to refugees in the camps dropped from 3.34 Jod/m3 to 0.24 Jod/m3 .",positive,951
952,The programme made similar efficiency gains in sanitation services and solid waste  collection.,positive,952
953,"Other Innovations led to more efficient coverage and management of services,  such as introducing a voucher system for contractors performing desludging that made them  accountable to camp residents and reduced potential corruption.",positive,953
954,Sustainability: UNICEF has done everything possible to ensure that its interventions are  long-lasting and that mechanisms are in place for their operation.,positive,954
955,"Examples include  organizing WASH committees to oversee water access and hygiene promotion, constructing  systems out of durable materials, and implementing messaging campaigns for hygiene  promotion and water conservation.",positive,955
956,UNICEF maintains initiatives that monitor coverage in the  camps and works with partners to ensure vulnerable populations receive necessary services.,positive,956
957,"These initiatives work specifically to monitor services to people with disabilities, identify  people who meet UNICEF’s vulnerability criteria, and ensure that interventions target  vulnerable people and households. ",positive,957
958,Coordination: UNICEF greatly minimized duplication of services and service gaps in  camps.,positive,958
959,Its role as WASH sector lead allowed it to assign sectors of Za’atari to the  responsibility of partner organizations and to set standards among those organizations.,positive,959
960,It  created similar standards and management arrangements in other camps. ,positive,960
961,"As sector lead,  UNICEF implemented mechanisms for coordination in the face of emergencies, such as  winter storms, and established third party monitoring systems that allow for quality and  security incident reporting. ",positive,961
962,UNICEF partners and GoJ officials that the evaluation team interviewed stated satisfaction  with UNICEF as sector lead.,positive,962
963,"One partner said that, “UNICEF … always (has) staff in  Azraq.” ",positive,963
964,A donor said that they were very happy with UNICEF’s coordination and  partnership.,positive,964
965,"A staff member of one partner said, “UNICEF does a very good job of  controlling the work.” ",positive,965
966,The decisions and actions UNICEF  took in the early days of the programme were crucial for initial inhabitants of Za’atari.,positive,966
967,"In the  settlements, UNICEF provided water and sanitation services to respond to the settlements’  exigencies.",positive,967
968,"UNICEF moved quickly and effectively, with clear goals, such as ensuring that  each person had at least 15 liters of water per day.",positive,968
969,The WASH programme also recognized  that its intervention would have an impact on the larger Ruwaished host community.,positive,969
970,"To  address that impact, UNICEF rehabilitated the community’s water and sanitation facilities  and provided support to identified vulnerable HHs. ",positive,970
971,"UNICEF’s installed higher cost and higher quality water infrastructure  at Za’atari, Rukban and Azraq, including the treatment plant for Zaatari.",positive,971
972,"In each case, a  robust design was followed by very good installation and excellent post construction  operation and maintenance. ",positive,972
973,This was borne out through the evaluation team’s on-site  investigations. ,positive,973
974,"In a key-informant interview (KII) with the contractor in Rukban, the  operators noted that UNICEF always purchases high quality equipment.",positive,974
975,"The result is  operational efficiency, equipment that is long-lasting in the harsh environments, and reduced  maintenance costs, downtime, and interruptions to supply. ",positive,975
976,These studies  kept UNICEF staff and sector participants informed of changes in the camps and other  locations and assisted the programme in staying relevant and responding quickly to  eventualities.,positive,976
977,UNICEF’s support was relevant.,positive,977
978,"t was aligned with the priorities of the GoI’s FBNC strategy, and the  specific focus on the SNCU programme.",positive,978
979,UNICEF also built in flexibility to enable adjustments in its  support to emerging needs.,positive,979
980,"For example, facilities were supported to provide new services such as  kangaroo mother care (KMC). ",positive,980
981,"Frequently, the needs were identified directly through high-level analyses of data collected from the SNCUs.",positive,981
982,"Overall, UNICEF’s approach – working with the GoI and the states rather than leading the programme – resulted in achievement of many of the main intended outcomes, particularly improving access to the SNCUs. ",positive,982
983,UNICEF support brought renewed focus on newborn health at district level across the country. ,positive,983
984,SNCUs  were scaled up to 214 of the 228 districts in the six selected states.,positive,984
985,UNICEF also supported the states  to establish SNCUs in tribal areas. ,positive,985
986,"The main equipment, installations and essential drugs for newborn care were mostly available in all  facilities with SNCUs.",positive,986
987,"Also, most SNCUs had integrated the recommended screening for visual and  hearing impairments into SNCU care.",positive,987
988,"UNICEF was cited as the lead organization supporting the development of SNCUs protocols, and the  protocols were available at almost all the SNCU units.",positive,988
989,UNICEF partnered with the NHM to strengthen human resource (HR) capacity at SNCUs. ,positive,989
990,This involved  strengthening institutions as regional centres to train and supervise SNCU staff.,positive,990
991,UNICEF supported the piloting and rolling out of an online computerised data capture and monitoring  system for SNCUs that allowed real-time reporting of data from each SNCU.,positive,991
992,The online system served  as the basis for providing regular feedback from the National Ministry of Health to states on care  practices at SNCUs.,positive,992
993,UNICEF also supported capacity building for deploying the online data system in  states and districts to analyse data and report to state and national governments.,positive,993
994,"Currently, about 85 per cent of all SNCUs report regularly through this online system, and data are analysed at national  level and reports shared periodically with states.",positive,994
995,"The proportion of scheduled tribe (ST) members among admissions to SNCUs was higher than was represented in the 0-6 years category in the 2011 national census, suggesting possible improvement  in access to STs (although without data on the relative burden of illnesses and preterm birth rates  among this population group, this finding is inconclusive).",positive,995
996,"Other components of the newborn health programme, in particular community  mobilisation by ASHAs, are key to addressing social determinants of health, including gender.",positive,996
997,"In the  six months preceding the evaluation, the SNCU online aggregate data revealed that over 14,300  newborns had been admitted to SNCUs.",positive,997
998,"UNICEF’s workplans and  reports show efforts had been made to improve quality in antenatal and postnatal care in other areas,  such as developing model labour rooms and developing and disseminating the Maternal Newborn  Health toolkit.",positive,998
999," In addition, UNICEF supported the government to strengthen antenatal, intranatal and  postnatal care through capacity building; the finalization and dissemination of the Emergency  Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC guidelines); and the strengthening of the maternal death  review.",positive,999
1000,"Regarding nominal expenditure, out of approximately INR 31,620 lakhs  (approx. US$50,016,0002 ) approved by GoI in the Programme Implementation Plans (PIPs) for the  FBNC programme, the Record of Proceedings (ROPs) show that only about 63 per cent were spent on  operational costs as most states had already functional SNCUs.",positive,1000
1001,"Other areas such as infrastructure  development, capacity building and procurement of equipment, took a tiny proportion of the state  FBNC budgets.",positive,1001
1002,"It was reported that UNICEF forged partnerships with other  groups and played a convening role in the normative function while involving other development  partners, professionals and professional associations in supportive roles.",positive,1002
1003,"UNICEF supported the state  governments by training, strengthening community monitoring and referrals by introducing an  application to track ASHA’s visits and supervision of babies discharged from the SNCU facilities.",positive,1003
1004,"Overall, UNICEF’s support to the programme was deemed sustainable particularly because of the close  partnership with the GoI during the national health missions and the implementation, as well as the  government’s commitment and leadership.",positive,1004
1005,The fact that no financial support had been provided to  the programme for the last few years by UNICEF and all funding was coming through the government- funded NHM was seen as proof of sustainability.,positive,1005
1006,Credit was given by evaluation respondents to  UNICEF for fostering government ownership.,positive,1006
1007,"UNICEF’s support to the FBNC programme, particularly the SNCUs, has been mostly successful in the  areas which UNICEF was expected to provide support.",positive,1007
1008,UNICEF support increased visibility and  improved national commitment to the FBNC programme. ,positive,1008
1009,"It improved staff capacity for the care of small and sick newborns  in SNCUs in a standardised way, guided by protocols and care guidelines.",positive,1009
1010,UNICEF support ensured the  main equipment and installations were in place in SNCUs.,positive,1010
1011, Interventions have also  been developed for the follow-up of babies discharged from SNCUs.,positive,1011
1012, UNICEF used a model of close  collaboration with the GoI through the NHM to support the programme which enhanced the  sustainability of many core components of the FBNC programme.,positive,1012
1013,"Moreover, the data collection system has  the potential to provide information to improve the quality of programme.",positive,1013
1014,Food Security: We find consistent impacts on food security by the programme for Phase 1  beneficiaries. ,positive,1014
1015,"Impacts range between 2 and 11 percentage point reductions for food insecurity  measures such as skipped a meal due to lack of money (3 percentage point reduction), no food in  household due to lack of money (9 percentage point reduction), and going to bed hungry  (11 percentage points reduction).",positive,1015
1016,"In addition to  reducing food insecurity, the programme also generated positive impacts on food consumption  and diet diversity.",positive,1016
1017," These food category impacts are quite large compared with the food insecurity  impacts, with the programme increasing the number households that ate meat or dairy by 23 and  22 percentage points, respectively.",positive,1017
1018,Roughly half of the beneficiary households ate meat  compared with only 26% of the non-beneficiary group.,positive,1018
1019,Consumption: We find a large impact on per capita food consumption consistent with the  impacts reported on reductions in food insecurity.,positive,1019
1020,"The programme demonstrates impacts consistently across  most food items in the survey including grains (353 Ariary per capita); tubers (95 Ariary per  capita); pulses (83 Ariary per capita); fruit and vegetables (roughly 60 Ariary per capita for  each); and meat, fish, and poultry (99 Ariary per capita).",positive,1020
1021,"Thus, the programme increases diet  diversity and consumption of important food staples such as vegetables, fruits, fats, and proteins  (pulses, meat, poultry, and fish).",positive,1021
1022,We also find impacts on consumption of common non-food items also consistent with other cash  transfer studies.,positive,1022
1023,"The programme increased consumption of soap and personal care products  (146 Ariary per capita and 95 Ariary per capita, respectively).",positive,1023
1024,his result could lead to improved  American Institutes for Research Impact Evaluation of Fiavota Emergency and Recovery  Cash Transfer in Madagascar—xiii health outcomes in the medium-to-long term because hand washing and bathing can greatly  reduce the spread of viruses and bacteria associated with common childhood diseases as well as  flu and cold transmission.,positive,1024
1025,"The programme also increases consumption of matches, lighters,  candles (16 Ariary per capita) and paraffin fuel (128 Ariary per capita).",positive,1025
1026,"We find a decrease in  consumption of charcoal and firewood of 380 Ariary per capita, suggesting that beneficiary  households are switching from charcoal and firewood for cooking and lighting to others energy  sources that may have fewer negative respiratory effects. ",positive,1026
1027,"If so, this result also would suggest that there are environmental and health benefits to the programme. ",positive,1027
1028,"Agricultural Production and Livestock: We do not find an impact on the total value of crops  produced, but do find impacts on some individual items.",positive,1028
1029,"The programme generates a large  impact on the amount of lentils and peanuts grown (106 kg for each), representing a roughly  500% increase over the comparison group.",positive,1029
1030,These results are consistent with the consumption and  food security findings about eating more food with proteins and fat.,positive,1030
1031,"We also find an increase  in the quantity of maize grown by 138 kg, representing a 300% increase over the comparison  group.",positive,1031
1032,"We did not find an impact to the intensive margin for cassava or yams; however, we do  find an impact to the extensive margin for cassava and yams, with a 10 percentage point increase  and 4 percentage point increase, respectively.",positive,1032
1033,The programme generated an effect where 30%  more households produce cassava than non-beneficiaries.,positive,1033
1034,The programme produces impacts to livestock ownership in addition to crop production.,positive,1034
1035,"The  programme increases the number of households that own sheep (19 percentage points), goats  (52 percentage points), and chickens (22 percentage points).",positive,1035
1036,These impacts are quite large given  that between 50% (chickens) and 400% (goats) more beneficiary households own at least one of  these types of livestock than comparison households.,positive,1036
1037,"This result is not terribly surprising though  because the programme started with an initial lump sum transfer that encouraged beneficiaries to  make a larger investment purchase, especially in livestock. ",positive,1037
1038,Resilience: We find that Fiavota improved beneficiaries’ resiliency as defined by the FAO.,positive,1038
1039,Most  of this impact comes from their improved food security and reducing the number of households  who turn to negative coping strategies.,positive,1039
1040,"Beneficiary households are less likely to reduce the  amount of food consumed per meal, reduce the number of meals they consume to cope with  shocks, gather wild food for meals, sell off household goods, or send household members to  another house for meals.",positive,1040
1041,"Together, these effects mean that beneficiary households are more  stable and can pursue positive coping mechanisms to deal with shocks instead of negative ones  that push them further into poverty and create other problems.",positive,1041
1042,Housing: We find that the programme generates large impacts for improved access to a latrine  and healthy sources of lighting. ,positive,1042
1043,"The programme had a 28 percentage point impact on latrine  access, more than doubling the treatment group’s access to a latrine compared with non- beneficiaries. ",positive,1043
1044,This result should help improve beneficiaries’ health over  time given their improved sanitation.,positive,1044

3573,This situation seemed to be influenced by two reasons: 1) the project design  not fully capturing these issues and therefore not providing a standard which left partners to  implement according to their own experience leading to variances in implementation between  districts; and 2) the lack of adequate policy guidance on standards. ,negative,3573
3574,"A participatory review of the project’s theory of change and supported by evaluation findings  showed that it provided a strong link to the results chain of the project but with missed  elaboration on MHM, policy influence, support for school based WASH planning and climate  risk management key issues to ensure WASH in schools is adequately and sustainability  addressed.",negative,3574

917,The latter half of the post-Alma-Ata era has witnessed vast  advances in information and communications technology that have revolutionized the delivery of  primary health care. ,positive,917
918,Innovations have come in less technology-related ways as well.,positive,918
919,"For example,  some have focused on improving service provision or enhancing the management of primary health  care; others have comprised structural and administrative innovations to devolve decision-making to  levels of government closer to the populations they serve; while others have focused on initiatives to  empower communities and individuals themselves to take a more active role in their health.",positive,919
920,"A range  of other innovations have centred on strengthening the resourcing of health, in terms of both financial  and human resources. ",positive,920
921,"Although vast gains have been made in health outcomes over the past four decades, it is unclear to  what extent these gains can be attributed directly to primary health care implementation. ",negative,921

928,Another broad category of challenges revolves around the many facets of quality of care.,negative,928
929,"At the  broadest level, numerous Member States maintained that low quality of services, long waiting times  and difficulties obtaining medical appointments represented some of their key challenges.",negative,929
930,"In those  Member States where primary care practitioners were involved as gatekeepers in order to reduce  inappropriate demands on costly secondary and institutional care, referral processes did not always  function as intended, contributing to fragmented or misdirected care. ",negative,930
931,"Elsewhere, especially in  countries affected by conflict, poor health infrastructure is a significant factor that negatively affects  quality of care.",negative,931
932,Numerous Member States indicate that they still face  challenges in generating and sustaining this political will.,neutral,932
933," In other countries, political will might be  present, but the policy context is inconducive to undertaking the ambitious changes necessary to  implement primary health care: policy agendas, policy design, policy coherence and governance have  often been inadequate, as has the regulatory framework for primary health care.",neutral,933
934,"In some countries,  government engagement with non-State actors has been weak. In others, political instability or  conflict have significantly hampered primary health care implementation efforts.",neutral,934

984,"The evaluation:  • documents key achievements, best practices, challenges, gaps and areas for improvement in the implementation of the FENSA since its adoption in May 2016; and • makes recommendations on the way forward to enable the full, coherent and consistent implementation of the FENSA. ",neutral,984
985,"In recognition of the complexity of the intergovernmental negotiations required to agree on the FENSA, the intrinsic sensitivity of the topic at hand, the number and diversity of  engagements involved, and the time, effort and resources invested to develop and maintain these  relationships, the evaluation did not assess the FENSA as a framework in itself but rather the  implementation of the FENSA.1 ",neutral,985
986,"The evaluation was undertaken in a participatory, utility-focused and rigorous manner: it provides robust evidence from multiple data sources, identifies learning opportunities and  frames practicable recommendations for course correction.",neutral,986
987,"In this vein, it is important to  underscore the formative nature of the evaluation: although it is too early to fully assess the  impact of the implementation of the FENSA, the evaluation does come at a juncture when  conditions for impact can be considered.",neutral,987
988,Its findings can help to inform and strengthen  application by WHO as it moves towards full implementation of both the FENSA and the  associated operating procedures.,neutral,988
989,"In this sense, the gaps and challenges identified in the report are  intended to be viewed constructively as an early opportunity for the Organization as a whole to learn  and improve its approach to implementation moving forward.",neutral,989
990,"In order to ensure a clear shared understanding of the evaluation topic and thus guide and structure the evaluation, a theory of change was retrospectively constructed during the  inception phase in collaboration with staff from the specialized unit responsible for performing  standard due diligence and risk assessment, as well as the WHO Evaluation Office. ",neutral,990
991,"The evaluation applied a mixed-methods approach, combining several sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence, including: (i) a review of over 120 key documents; (ii) face- to-face and virtual interviews and focus groups with 150 key stakeholders (WHO senior  management; those staff most closely associated with the implementation of the FENSA and other  relevant technical staff within WHO across the three levels of the Organization, such as designated  focal points for the FENSA and designated technical officers); (iii) focus groups with 56 FENSA  focal points in Geneva-based missions; (iv) a global survey of all Member States; (v) a survey of  non-State actors in official relations with WHO (entities serving as Collaborating Centres were  also surveyed in relation to the FENSA, as part of a wider concurrent evaluation of Collaboration  Centres, and a limited sample of non-State actors not yet eligible in their bid for official relations  with WHO was also consulted); and (vi) a survey of WHO representatives.",neutral,991
992,The survey response  rates were as follows: 17.5% of Member States; 26.1% of non-State actors in official relations with  WHO; and 18.1% of WHO representatives. ,neutral,992
993,"In line with the standards of the United Nations Evaluation Group, the evaluation report contains further details on the evaluation methodology, including a summary of methodological  limitations. ",neutral,993
994,"The evaluation identified the following findings, organized according to the United Nations Evaluation Group evaluation criteria, highlighting both implementation achievements  and gaps in the implementation of the FENSA to date. ",neutral,994
995,The FENSA constitutes a coherent and integrated framework compared to previously separated and discrete engagement policies for different non-State actors.,positive,995
996,"It is the first  comprehensive framework within the United Nations system that covers interaction with four  categories of non-State actors, including nongovernmental organizations, private sector entities,  philanthropic foundations and academic institutions, along with specific policies for each  category. ",positive,996
997,"In this respect, the existence of the FENSA is a significant accomplishment in its own  right and a precedent for the wider United Nations system.",positive,997
998,"That said, there is an absence of a comprehensive, actionable strategy and associated implementation plan to achieve the overall aims of the FENSA at all three levels of WHO.",negative,998
999,"In  response to requests by the Independent Expert Oversight Advisory Committee, an  implementation plan was approved on 21 December 2017.",neutral,999
1000,"The use and value of this document  has been limited, however, and it not a sufficiently actionable plan to guide coherent and  systematic implementation of the FENSA due to the 18-month lag time from the resolution’s  adoption to the approval of the draft plan, coupled with the limited communication and use of the  plan as an instrument for implementation. ",negative,1000
1001,The timeframe for WHO to fully implement the FENSA  and operating procedures appears to have been overly optimistic in light of WHO’s capacity and  capability to institute change effectively – a challenge exacerbated by the fact that a phased  approach to implementation had not been included in the adopted resolution despite a  recommendation to this effect having previously been identified in an external audit of the  implications of the FENSA’s implementation conducted in 2016 (i.e. just prior to the resolution’s  adoption). ,negative,1001
1002,"As a result of this  gap, downstream actions to implement the FENSA have been fragmented and not supported by a  coherent communication and information dissemination strategy. ",negative,1002
1003,The absence of effective  communication and information dissemination plans to support the implementation of the  FENSA among audiences internal and external to WHO has compromised roll-out.,negative,1003
1004,Staff and  partner needs have mainly been addressed in a responsive and reactive manner rather than  proactively.,negative,1004
1005,"Where communications activity has taken place, this activity has not kept pace with  changing staff and partner needs in the dynamic FENSA implementing context. ",negative,1005
1006,"Given the absence of a comprehensive FENSA implementation strategy or plan, activities and outputs were clustered into the following tiers for the purposes of this evaluation to enable  systematic and structured assessment, as well as an exploration of the interconnectedness  between activities and outputs: • Tier 1: Strengthening understanding, ownership and management of the risks and benefits of engagement; • Tier 2: Specializing and applying nuanced application (technical and contextual); • Tier 3: Expert technical advice and institutional memory for standardized procedures. Escalation point for exceptional cases. ",neutral,1006
1007,"Despite the lack of an overarching strategy that would establish guideposts for maximally efficient and effective implementation of the FENSA, the evaluation team notes that, as a testament to the considerable efforts of staff, WHO has succeeded in initiating (if not completing)  implementation on all aspects required by resolution WHA69.10.",positive,1007
1008,"Within each of the three tiers, a  number of key outputs were delivered within the two-year implementation timeframe.",positive,1008
1009,This  significant achievement forms a solid foundation for the FENSA’s further implementation. ,positive,1009
1010,"Nonetheless, these actions have been undertaken in an ad hoc, fragmented and unsystematic  manner across the Organization and implementation was not sufficiently resourced. ",negative,1010
1011,"However, more limited progress has been made in other important areas, such as full functionality of the Register of non-State actors through the inclusion of all non-State actors;  coordinated staff training across all three levels of the Organization; the development of  electronic workflows on the now-paused Global Engagement Management system and the active  convening of the FENSA Proposal Review Committee, which appears to have convened  infrequently. ",negative,1011
1012,A number of significant delays were observed between the immediacy of  implementation requested in the resolution and actual delivery timescales. ,negative,1012
1013,"Furthermore, the  evaluation team noted evidence of a greater weighting of the risk management goals of the FENSA  in the implementation of its activities rather than in its promoting and engagement-enhancing  goals.",negative,1013
1014,"While this progress to date offers WHO a solid platform on which to build, moving forward  there is a need to ensure that the dual objectives of the FENSA are equally emphasized. ",negative,1014
1015,"Furthermore, owing to the dynamic organizational context in WHO, some activities and outputs completed to date are now in need of further iteration or development or require  supporting actions. ",negative,1015
1016,"Examples include (i) review of the FENSA guides and guidance to include  updates regarding the Register of non-State actors, electronic workflows and the composition of  the FENSA Proposal Review Committee; (ii) strengthening and delivery of training materials to  include lessons learned and practical examples; and (iii) ongoing maintenance of the FENSA focal  point network.",neutral,1016
1017,"Recognizing the achievement of the short-term results of implementation activities and outputs, sequencing and delivery delays have nonetheless impacted on the achievement of the  coherent and consistent implementation of the FENSA across all three levels of the Organization,4 which would lead to the comprehensive achievement of identified outcomes.5 ",negative,1017
1018,The overall implementation status of FENSA outputs and activities is summarized in Figure 1. ,neutral,1018
1019,"As illustrated in this figure, eight key activities and deliverables have been fully  completed or are near completion; six are ongoing with continued effort required; and three are  in need of immediate attention to either initiate or accelerate. ",positive,1019
1020,"In addition, no financial  monitoring of the explicit or hidden costs of implementation has taken place. ",negative,1020
1021,"A significant majority of stakeholders, both internal and external to WHO, are of the opinion that the FENSA has at least to some extent been successful in achieving its immediate  objectives. ",positive,1021
1022,The FENSA has generally brought greater clarity for both WHO and non-State actors  around the requirements and standards for engagement. ,positive,1022
1023,"hat said, translating policy into  practice for different kinds of engagement appears less clear, especially among WHO staff and  Member States.",negative,1023
1024,The delegation of accountability for managed risk is not well understood. ,negative,1024
1025,Stakeholders likewise believe that the FENSA has more generally brought greater coherence and consistency in WHO’s engagement with non-State actors.,positive,1025
1026,"However,  implementation planning and roll-out has been insufficiently coordinated or integrated across  the Organization, resulting in inconsistent application of the FENSA.",negative,1026
1027,"While the FENSA has contributed to demystifying the principles of WHO’s engagement with non-State actors, the inconsistent implementation of the FENSA and the shortcomings of the  Register of non-State actors have affected the perceived transparency of the process. ",negative,1027
1028,"The FENSA has to some extent encouraged WHO staff and non-State actors to think more strategically about their engagement, especially when entering into official relations.",positive,1028
1029,"It is less  evident for other types of engagement, while risk aversion (as opposed to risk awareness and risk  management) might be leading to missed opportunities for positive engagement. ",negative,1029
1030,"It is likely that the FENSA has, by design, protected WHO from engaging with non-State actors that could jeopardize the credibility of its work",positive,1030
1031,"At the same time, there is a sense among  some stakeholders that the FENSA has amplified organizational risk-averseness, with the result  that it may inadvertently be preventing otherwise positive engagements from occurring.",negative,1031
1032, Information-sharing on the FENSA within WHO  remains largely informal and ad hoc. ,negative,1032
1033,"As a key FENSA stakeholder group, Member States report  that they are not sufficiently informed about implementation and the difference it is making – despite routine updates to Member States by WHO – as this reporting is primarily geared towards  an account of activities and outputs.",negative,1033
1034,"Given data paucity challenges, including the lack of an effective monitoring and evaluation mechanism as recommended in 20166 to ascertain whether intended benefits and results have  been achieved as set out, it is challenging to reliably assess sustainability or impact at this early  stage of FENSA’s implementation. ",negative,1034
1035,"Nonetheless, based on the assessment of relevance, efficiency  and effectiveness, the evaluation team concludes that enabling conditions for sustainability and  impact7 are increasingly present.",positive,1035
1036,"Notwithstanding the gaps and areas for improvement cited in the evaluation report, the  conditions for future impact and sustainability otherwise appear to be in place.",positive,1036
1037,"These include  increasing levels of commitment to the FENSA from WHO’s senior management and Member  States; a recognition that increasing resources are needed to fully implement the FENSA; and a  gradual, steady and explicit shift toward greater tolerance for risk, particularly at senior  management levels, resulting in increased risk management. ",positive,1037
1038,"t is additionally noted that the  FENSA yields mutual benefit for stakeholders; that it is easier to engage under the FENSA; and  that clarity has improved on how to work with non-State actors at country, regional and global  levels.",positive,1038
1039,"At the same time, the burden of FENSA implementation is being significantly felt within  WHO, posing potential risks to its impact and sustainability moving forward. ",negative,1039
1040,"Residual issues related to the coherence of FENSA’s implementation remain, both from a  policy coherence perspective – in particular related to the FENSA’s implications for procurement– and in terms of coherence with key reform initiatives, notably the transformation agenda, where  further coherence through integration and alignment is needed. ",negative,1040
1041,WHO’s internal and external operating context has contributed to the challenges  encountered during implementation.,negative,1041
1042,"These factors associated with its operating context include  the following:  • the realities of implementing change in a decentralized structure – and the nature of  implementing change where there exists shared institutional responsibly across the  levels of the Organization but no clear accountability;  • the need for organizational discipline to implement changes in behaviour, set against the  risk of institutional non-compliance with administrative processes; and  • the nascent state of several enabling conditions, identified in the factors affecting  implementation as set out below, which has limited the achievement of outcomes. ",negative,1042
1043,"Despite considerable effort being exerted by WHO staff, who have worked hard to translate  policy into practice, a number of key factors affecting implementation are identified in the  evaluation. ",negative,1043
1044,"These include the following: 31. The perception that senior management’s endorsement and support was initially lacking, and  that senior management had communicated mixed messages in the early implementation phase. ",negative,1044
1045,This perceived lack of high-level support limited the catalytic conditions necessary for change  and muted mechanisms for buy-in across the Organization. ,negative,1045
1046,"The absence of an overarching Organization-wide actionable implementation strategy for  engagement, comprised of specific, concrete actions to be undertaken in a phased way for  translating the broad goals of the FENSA into a concrete, actionable plan for the Organization’s  engagement with non-State actors; and for situating and calibrating the FENSA as a framework.",negative,1046
1047,"As  such, it represents a critical linchpin affecting all other aspects of implementation and is thus  vii | P a g e worth emphasizing as a significant factor affecting all subsequent aspects of implementation,  namely in the following ways: • A comprehensive overview of what implementation would entail (scope) at the “global/ enterprise level” was ill-defined and the roll-out of implementation actions was insufficiently aligned, coordinated or integrated across all three levels of the Organization; • The timeframe for a full and complete implementation of both the FENSA and the operating procedures was overly optimistic about WHO’s capacity and capability to institute change effectively; • There was insufficient recognition of, and resourcing to meet, the challenges of enacting change within WHO’s decentralized structure, nor was implementation geared to capitalize on this structure by having coordinated action universally and uniformly applied across the three levels of the Organization – recommendations from a 2016 external audit on the implications of implementation in this regard do not appear to have been fully enacted; • Inter-dependencies between key mechanisms and tools to support implementation were underestimated, with implications for efficiency and cost-efficiency; limited progress in one area substantially affected progress in others (e.g. electronic workflow for the internal management of engagement using the Global Engagement Management system; or delays in delivery of guides, handbooks and training).",negative,1047
1048,"Only limited outreach activities have been undertaken, while a coordinated process of harvesting  feedback and disseminating implementation success stories and lessons (i.e. what has worked in  various settings and why or how) has been lacking. ",negative,1048
1049,"This absence has further reduced  opportunities for sensitization, familiarization and staff buy-in into the FENSA and its  implementation. ",negative,1049
1050,"In addition to (and as a result of) the aforementioned factor of resource limitations  limiting the capacity to implement, there has been no dedicated capacity for FENSA’s  implementation beyond the specialized unit responsible for performing standard due diligence  and risk assessment, which constitutes only one facet of implementation. ",negative,1050
1051,"Moreover, the  organizational structural changes as a result of the transformation agenda have affected the roles  and responsibilities of those designed to implement the FENSA (e.g. the composition of the FENSA  Proposal Review Committee and Steering Committee; alongside FENSA focal points).",negative,1051
1052,"Staff  perception is that WHO is increasingly paralysed due to resolutions, rules, regulations and  frameworks without prioritization and that the FENSA as a major organizational endeavour has  been somewhat buried under a larger set of changes. ",negative,1052
1053,"In addition, no financial monitoring of the explicit or hidden  implementation costs is taking place. ",negative,1053
1054,"While progress reporting on implementation status has been provided through  regular reporting requirements, this reporting has predominantly been at the level of output and  activity rather than on the intended effects of the FENSA. ",negative,1054
1055,The absence of an overall monitoring  and evaluation mechanism to ascertain whether intended benefits and results are achieved has  been a limiting factor. ,negative,1055
1056,"As a result, there has been little systematic discussion or space for learning,  or of adaptation and fine-tuning of implementation approaches.",negative,1056
1057,"Accordingly, conclusions and  findings in the present evaluation represent the first such reflective juncture on the extent to  which intended results of the FENSA have been achieved at this early stage of implementation. ",neutral,1057
1058,The availability of instruments and information in all official languages of the Organization has been a constraint for staff and non-State actors alike where English is not a first language.,negative,1058
1059,"Alongside the aforementioned findings, the evaluation generated several lessons to help guide future implementation. ",neutral,1059
1060,"These lessons relate to:  • ensuring that a coordinated implementation strategy and plan are established early in the process and within the overall timeframe for delivery; • ensuring that the implementation strategy is signed off and “sponsored” at a sufficiently senior level to secure endorsement and buy-in across the three levels of the Organization; • ensuring the implementation strategy is clearly and widely communicated (e.g. through roadshows, townhall meetings, brown bag lunches or lunch-and-learn sessions, outreach and familiarization events); • setting realistic timeframes for delivery of the implementation plan based on available resources, ensuring full analysis of underlying assumptions and possible follow-on effects of interlinked activities and outputs; • bringing strong project management and change management knowledge, skills and experience to bear on implementation, as these are technical, professional disciplines in and of themselves that are complementary to the professional disciplines for which WHO is respected; • putting in place a strong oversight mechanism and team that are able to generate buy-in across the Organization (bearing in mind that proper oversight by WHO management and governance structures rests on a clear implementation plan and a results framework); • regularly monitoring – and adjusting as necessary – administrative procedures and processes in order to ensure that the balance between competing priorities and characteristics is weighted proportionately.",negative,1060
1061,"While the evaluation  finds that no compelling evidence of this risk has materialized to date, continued vigilance  in this matter is advised to avoid possible adverse behaviours. ",negative,1061
1062,"Recognizing the complexity of the intergovernmental negotiations required to agree on the FENSA and the considerable effort exerted by WHO staff to implement the FENSA in the spirit  of, and in alignment with, the principles it embodies, which forms a solid foundation moving  forward, the FENSA’s continued implementation should take account of the following  recommendations. ",positive,1062
1063,"WHO collaborating centres (CCs) have been in place since the founding of the World Health Organization (WHO), with the first WHO CC having been designated in 1948. ",neutral,1063
1064,WHO CCs are a mechanism of cooperation  in which relevant institutions are recognized by WHO as assisting the Organization in implementing its  mandated work by: supporting the achievement of WHO’s planned strategic objectives at the regional  and global levels; enhancing the scientific validity of its global health work; and developing and  strengthening institutional capacity in countries and regions. ,neutral,1064
1065,"The main functions of CCs include: • collection, collation and dissemination of information; • standardization of terminology and nomenclature of technology, diagnostic, therapeutic and prophylactic substances, and of methods and procedures; • development of evidence-based technical guidance tools and resource materials; • provision of reference substances and services; • participation in collaborative research developed under WHO’s leadership; • training, including research training; • coordination of joint activities; • capacity building work at country level; and • provision of monitoring, preparedness and response services to deal with disease outbreaks and public health emergencies.",neutral,1065
1066,WHO’s work with CCs is intended to benefit both parties.,neutral,1066
1067,"Through this work, WHO stands to gain access  to leading institutions worldwide and the institutional capacity to support its work. ",neutral,1067
1068,"In turn, institutions designated as CCs stand to gain visibility and recognition by national authorities, as well as greater  attention from the public for the health issues on which they work. ",neutral,1068
1069,It has been 12 years since the last evaluation of WHO’s work with CCs was carried out in 2007. ,neutral,1069
1070,"Recommendations from the 2007 evaluation addressed a wide range of issues, from putting in place or  updating internal policies to guide the work with CCs at all levels of the Organization, to changing  administrative procedures for designating and redesignating CCs, and developing a clear and common  shared vision of the strategic role of CCs.",neutral,1070
1071,There are currently 822 CCs across the six WHO regions.,neutral,1071

1078,"This evaluation applied a mixed-method approach that compiled evidence from several sources of  qualitative and quantitative data, including: (a) a review of relevant documents; (b) face-to-face and  virtual interviews, as well as focus group discussions, with 66 key stakeholders (i.e., WHO senior managers  across the Organization, Responsible Officers (ROs), the Global Regional Focal Point (GFP) team and  Regional Focal Points(RFPs) for CCs, Technical Counterparts(TCs), the Due Diligence and Non-State Actors  team associated with the implementation of the Framework of Engagement with Non-State Actors (FENSA), and selected heads of CCs; and (c) two online surveys, one soliciting the perspectives of the heads  of CCs (the survey had a 38% response rate, i.e., 314 out of 822 CCs) and another soliciting the views of  WHO staff working directly with CCs, such as ROs and TCs (the survey had a 25% response rate, i.e., 96 out of 391 ROs/TCs).",neutral,1078
1079,The evaluation covered CCs that were active during the biennium 2018-2019. ,neutral,1079
1080,"Owing  to a lack of robust monitoring data on the work of CCs, the evaluation relied primarily on the key informant  interviews and the online surveys to answer the evaluation questions.",neutral,1080
1081,"Over the past 12 years, WHO has undertaken a range of actions in response to the recommendations of  the previous evaluation, leading to improvements in the management of its relationship with CCs and to  closer alignment of the work of CCs with WHO’s priorities.",positive,1081
1082,"For example, significant changes have been made to WHO’s approach to working with CCs and the processes for designating and redesignating CCs through: a) the introduction and continued improvement of the Electronic Collaborating Centres (eCC),  a web-based e-Work interface for initiating and managing these partnerships more efficiently; b) the  improvement of guidelines for heads of CCs and WHO staff working with CCs; and c) the introduction of  a due diligence process to ensure compliance with FENSA, a framework aimed at strengthening WHO’s  engagement with non-State actors such as NGOs, philanthropic foundations and academic institutions. ",positive,1082
1083,Currently the approval process using the eCC provides opportunities to ensure alignment between the  workplans of CCs and WHO priorities. ,positive,1083
1084,"Additionally, WHO guidelines for WHO and CC staff as well as the  eManual provide details on how this alignment should take place. ",positive,1084
1085,"In recent years, these changes have  led to a considerable reduction in the number of CCs, which has been achieved through the  discontinuation of inactive, ineffective and less strategically aligned CCs and through concerted efforts to designate or redesignate only those CCs that can contribute to WHO’s priorities. ",positive,1085
1086,"As a result, most of  the work delivered by CCs is relevant to WHO’s GPW and aligned with GPW outcomes and outputs. ",positive,1086
1087,"Despite this progress, a number of outstanding gaps have hindered the ability of CCs to ensure continued  relevance of their work to WHO’s priorities. ",negative,1087
1088,"For example, despite the efforts to streamline the process  of designating and redesignating CCs and make it more strategic, there are still several inactive or  ineffective CCs, which may pose reputational risks for the Organization. ",negative,1088
1089,"Additionally, the previous  evaluation highlighted the need for WHO to have strategic plans that serve as a reference point for  selecting, designating and discontinuing CCs. ",neutral,1089
1090,"However, WHO still lacks a comprehensive organization- wide strategic plan for working with CCs that includes specific actions at the global, regional, and  technical programme area levels. ",negative,1090
1091,"While some of the departments have developed and implemented such  plans with positive effects, others did not, mainly owing to the lack of engagement at the senior  management level and the lack of resources to support implementation and monitoring. ",negative,1091
1092,"The views of key stakeholders underscore the continued importance of these partnerships to the  fulfilment of the GPW, even though the evaluation highlighted the need for further improvements.",positive,1092
1093,A  majority of WHO staff who participated in the online survey consider CCs to be making a highly valuable  contribution to the achievement of WHO’s objectives. ,positive,1093
1094,"Many considered CCs as key partners, without  which they would be unable to fulfil their WHO remit.",positive,1094
1095,This sentiment was particularly pronounced among  iii WHO staff who work with limited financial resources or in very small teams.,positive,1095
1096,"There is also a good level of  understanding among most, but not all, heads of CCs about how their work contributes to the delivery  of WHO’s priorities. ",positive,1096
1097,Engaging key CC staff in discussions around WHO’s strategic priorities could increase  their understanding of WHO’s priorities as presented in GPW13 and beyond. ,negative,1097
1098,"At the same time, many CC and WHO staff have a limited understanding of the needs and requirements  of the FENSA due diligence process.",negative,1098

1101,Both WHO staff and CC heads broadly felt that CCs contribute significantly to the delivery of WHO’s  results by undertaking important activitiesin the areas of: (a) provision of technical expertise; (b) capacity  building; (c) research; (d) policy development; and (e) emergency response.,positive,1101
1102,"CCs linked to WHO regional  offices tend to focus more on direct technical assistance and capacity-building support to countries, while  also improving WHO’s access to high-quality technical expertise and research capabilities at this level. ",positive,1102
1103,"Those linked to the HQ technical programmes, by comparison, tend to work on issues that are global in  nature, such as research, guidelines and policy development.",positive,1103
1104,These HQ-linked CCs are an effective  mechanism for developing global thought leadership and increasing the evidence base for policy-making.,positive,1104
1105,"Indeed, WHO staff identified the development of global thought leadership and global communities of  advocates for WHO’s work as one of the key areas where the work of CCs have added the greatest value. ",positive,1105
1106,Accessing global experts to engage in dialogue around policy or research ensures collaborative  knowledge generation.,positive,1106
1107,CC experts supporting the work of WHO provide specific knowledge and expertise that WHO staff may not necessarily have.,positive,1107
1108,"In this regard, several WHO staff felt that the large CC network  has improved the quality and relevance of WHO’s policy and research and development work.",positive,1108
1109,"In addition,  WHO’s collaboration with CCs extends the Organization’s scope of influence as it generates new advocacy  opportunities through which WHO can position its policy work. ",positive,1109
1110,"However, the potential of CCs to make a meaningful contribution at global level is curtailed by their  unequal representation at the global level and across regions.",negative,1110
1111,"An analysis of the location  of the 822 currently designated CCs, which are based in 99 countries across all six WHO regions, reveals that there is an imbalance in the geographic distribution of CCs in favour of high-income countries and  specific regions. ",negative,1111
1112,"All told, fully one-third of all CCs are based in the European Region, while 24% are based  in the Western Pacific Region, 22% in the Region of the Americas, 13% in the South-East Asia Region, 5%  in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and only 3% in the African Region. ",neutral,1112
1113,"Furthermore, nearly 80% of all CCs are based in 22 countries, 13 of which are high-income countries.",neutral,1113
1114,"As a result, the potential of the CCs  to achieve maximum effectiveness globally is limited by the unevenness in their global presence and  reach. ",negative,1114
1115,CC heads expressed that what they most value in their relationship with WHO is the contribution that  they make to global health outcomes by supporting WHO to fulfil its mandate.,positive,1115
1116,"They also noted that the relationship helped CCs gain access to broader global networks  of CC institutions working in similar fields, thereby increasing their visibility at regional or global level. ",positive,1116
1117,Increased involvement in policy-making processes was also identified as an important added value of the  collaboration with WHO.,positive,1117
1118,"Moreover, some institutions apply the learning and good practices that emerge from their role as CCs across other programmes, thereby improving the quality and consistency of the  work delivered by their respective institutions more broadly. ",positive,1118
1119,"Notwithstanding the aforementioned positive aspects of WHO’s work with CCs, there are a number of  areas in which WHO’s work with CCs has been less effective. ",negative,1119
1120,One of these areas relates to the monitoring  of the work delivered by CCs.,neutral,1120
1121,One of these areas relates to the monitoring  of the work delivered by CCs.,negative,1121
1122,Stakeholders noted that internal processes for monitoring and reporting  could be improved.,negative,1122
1123,"In particular, the heads of CCs expressed that the feedback they receive from WHO  staff on the annual reports that they submit does not meet expectations. ",negative,1123
1124,"Additionally, numerous  stakeholders highlighted that there have been missed opportunities to assess the contribution of the  work of CCs to WHO’s results.",negative,1124
1125,"Although this contribution is valued by WHO, opportunities forshowcasing the work of CCs both within WHO and externally have been limited. ",negative,1125
1126,Interviews with WHO staff and heads of CCs also indicate that CCs often have workplans that are too  broad and therefore difficult to implement within the designation period. ,negative,1126
1127,"Indeed, achieving the  ambitious objectives in these workplans would require additional resources and capacities. ",negative,1127
1128,"Therefore,  they expressed that there is room for further improving the planning process to ensure that the identified  objectives are clear and realistic. ",negative,1128
1129,"Such broad workplans, on the one hand, allow flexibility for them to  adapt to WHO’s priorities, as these can shift during the designation period.; on the other hand, the  breadth of these workplans often entails a need for more resources and capacity if the CCs are to fully  utilise and to demonstrate tangible results.",negative,1129
1130,The evaluation identified several key factors that have enabled CCs to work effectively and overcome  their challenges.,positive,1130
1131,These include: effective communication between CCs and WHO from the planning stage  to implementation and monitoring; effective planning processes that are facilitated by an open and transparent discussion on the roles of key stakeholders and expectations vis-à-vis the relationship.,positive,1131
1132,"CC  heads also underlined that networks of CCs working in the same or similar areas is a key factor enabling  the achievement of results, although some also mentioned that more networking opportunities is  warranted.",positive,1132
1133,"They further noted that the WHO CC “brand” is a key factor that enables CCs to fulfil their  role as it increases the institution’s visibility and trust by the Government, partners and donors, and,  consequently allows the institution to mobilise additional resources.",positive,1133
1134,Other enabling factors include  positive working relationships between CCs and WHO based on mutual trust and the presence of a  strategy or approach guiding WHO’s work with CCs. ,positive,1134
1135,Other key  challenges faced by the CCs include: ambiguity over WHO’s expectations; lack of joint planning; the  administrative burden of the designation and redesignation process; and lack of transparent  communication – especially in relation to the reasons for delays in the approval of proposals. ,negative,1135
1136,Stakeholders also noted that there is a need for WHO to better communicate to CCs its changing  priorities.,negative,1136
1137,An assessment of the efficiency of WHO’s work with CCs reveals a mixed picture. ,negative,1137
1138,"On the one hand, there  has been considerable improvement in ensuring that inactive CCs do not continue to hold the CC  designation, thus helping to avoid an overstretch of already-limited capacities for CC engagements. ",positive,1138
1139,"Improvements in the designation and redesignation process have reportedly helped in identifying institutions that have the capacity, resources and expertise to contribute optimally to WHO’s results. ",positive,1139
1140,Human and financial resourcing of the CCs represents a distinct and considerable aspect of efficiency. ,positive,1140
1141,"WHO does not provide any financial resourcesto CCs for the implementation of their workplan, although  it does dedicate significant staff time.",negative,1141
1142,"By contrast, WHO CCs contribute significant levels of financial,  human and technical resources to WHO.",positive,1142
1143,"Stakeholders highlighted that having a strategic planning  process in place at the regional, department or technical programme area level is essential to ensure  that financial and technical resources are used efficiently and strategically, and that there is no  duplication of efforts.",positive,1143
1144,CC heads also explained that part of their role as CCs is to respond to ad hoc  requests to implement activities that are emerging priorities for WHO.,neutral,1144
1145,"CCs tend to see these ad hoc  activities as an important element of their role, particularly in emergency situations.",positive,1145
1146,"hey further noted  that mobilizing resources within a short timeframe has proved challenging, although CCs have responded  to these requests in a timely manner.",positive,1146
1147,"In this regard, CCs are perceived as highly cost-effective means of  achieving the goals of the GPW. ",positive,1147
1148,"At the same time, several challenges have hampered the efficiency of WHO’s work with the CCs.",negative,1148
1149,"In  particular, there are substantial costs incurred by WHO in managing its work with CCs.",negative,1149
1150,"These costs mainly  involve the staff time of ROs and TCs, the majority of whom are senior-level officials, and those involved  in decision-making on the designation and redesignation process – e.g., directors, Assistant Directors- General, Global and Regional Focal Points, and the FENSA due diligence team.",negative,1150
1151,"Although it is difficult to  monetize the exact value of such human investments, they are not negligible. ",negative,1151
1152,"However, considering the  substantial amount of time that most ROs and some TCs spend undertaking CC-related work, this aspect  of their work is rarely reflected in their Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) plans and performance assessments.",negative,1152
1153,"Most fundamentally, despite the significant investment of human  resource capacity in CC-related work, there has been a significant (some stakeholders say urgent) need  for additional capacity to support the management of CCs at the global and regional levels – as well as  for training and support for staff, especially surrounding good practice in working with CCs and awareness  of the requirements of the FENSA due diligence process. ",negative,1153
1154,"Other major efficiency-related concerns centre on: administrative and management systems; lack of joint  decision-making on the designation and redesignation process of CCs, coupled with delays in these processes; the lack of transparent communication on the reasons for delays in approving a proposal and  reasons for discontinuing a designation; as well as a lack of awareness of the work CCs deliver, both internally within WHO as well as externally. ",negative,1154
1155,"For example, the administrative and management systems currently in place support both CCs and WHO  staff throughout the process of designation and redesignation. ",neutral,1155
1156,These systems also support CC and WHO  staff in planning and delivering CC activities. ,positive,1156
1157,"However, those who use this system report that it is not as  efficient or robust as it could be.",negative,1157
1158,"In particular, they indicate that the Electronic Collaborating Centres  (eCC) system could be made more user-friendly and that the approval steps could be streamlined. ",negative,1158
1159,They also noted that the system could allow for more flexibility in the permitted formats of eCC submissions.,negative,1159
1160,"Delays in the designation and redesignation process reportedly stem from: (a) a lack of engagement of  all decision-makers from the beginning of the process; (b) the time required for due diligence review under FENSA; (c) delays in taking decisions on whether to continue or discontinue a CC; and (d) the  vi cyclical nature of the system, which requires that when feedback is provided at any point in the  designation and redesignation process, it is resubmitted at the start of the system for approval by all  stakeholders.",negative,1160
1161,"hese delays have resulted in a loss of momentum in the relationship, missed opportunities, mistrust, and negative expectations of working with WHO. ",negative,1161
1162,Communication between WHO staff and CCs is cited as another area in which timeliness and quality are  less than optimal.,negative,1162
1163,"In this vein, there is a substantial difference in the perception of WHO staff and heads of CCs surrounding the regularity of such communication.",negative,1163
1164,"Whereas the vast majority of WHO staff who  directly work with CCs mentioned that communication with the CCs occurs twice a year, over half of the  heads of CCs noted that communication with WHO only happens once year. ",negative,1164
1165,"As noted above,  communication that feeds into monitoring systems presents a particularly significant challenge. ",negative,1165
1166,The internal and external lack of awareness of the work CCs deliver for WHO is seen as being the result  of a lack of regular and formal communication processes. ,negative,1166
1167,"This lack of awareness has reduced opportunities to apply a more strategic approach to planning and implementing the work of CCs and to maximise the potential use of existing CCs to achieve major health objectives in an effective, efficient  manner. ",negative,1167
1168,The designation of a new CC or redesignation of an existing CC has been most effective when there is a  strategic approach in place to ensure the relevance of the work of the CC and its alignment with WHO’s  priorities.,positive,1168
1169,"Where there has been a systematic and transparent mechanism in place for approving  designation/redesignation proposals, for engaging senior management, and for communicating decisions on the designation or redesignation of a CCs in a timely manner, it was easier for Responsible Officers to  manage WHO’s relationships with CCs. ",positive,1169
1170,"Continued designation and redesignation of ineffective and  inactive CCs resulting from internal or external pressures could reduce the relevance of the work of the  CCs to WHO’s priorities, and entails potential reputational risks. ",negative,1170
1171,"The effectiveness of CCs has been enhanced in situations where there is a regional, departmental or  network strategy in place.",positive,1171
1172,"These strategies often cover approaches to the identification, designation and  redesignation of CCs, as well as the management and review of CCs and their work. ",neutral,1172
1173,The development  and use of strategies for working with CCs by WHO staff and senior managers has increased the  effectiveness of the CCs work and maximized their contribution. ,positive,1173
1174,"Moving forward, there is a potential for WHO to work more effectively and efficiently with CC by establishing clear strategic plans, leadership and decision-making processes at the highest levels to  formulate WHO’s future approach of working with CCs.",negative,1174
1175,An organizational strategy for working with CCs  could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the work delivered by CCs.,negative,1175
1176,"Likewise, the use of  networks of CCs working in the same or similar technical areas can help CCs maximize their contribution  to WHO’s results. ",negative,1176
1177,There are several specific challenges faced by CCs based in low- and middle-income countries. ,negative,1177

1276,"With an estimated population of 200 million and a  growth rate of 3.2 per cent, Nigeria is the most populous  country in Africa.",neutral,1276
1277,Nigeria has a Gross Domestic Product  (GDP) of US$ 448.10 billion making it the largest econ- omy in the continent.,neutral,1277
1278,Nigeria also exerts significant  influence on the Economic Community of West African  States (ECOWAS) – a regional political and economic  union of fifteen countries located in West Africa with an  estimated combined population of over 349 million. ,neutral,1278
1279,"The country currently, ranks 181 of 193 countries on the  Gender Equality Index3  for reasons such as poor resource  allocation in the economic and social sectors, frequent  conflicts, forced displacements and inadequate inclusion  of women and girls’ perspectives in policy-making  decisions. ",neutral,1279
1280,"The CPE was guided by the evaluation criteria of  relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, human  rights and gender equality.",neutral,1280
1281,The evaluation used a  theory-based cluster design and a contribution analysis. ,neutral,1281
1282,Multiple streams of evidence and data were collected  through an extensive desk review of documentary evi- dence; key informant interviews; FGDs; and a survey of  CO staff and partners. ,neutral,1282
1283,"The evaluation team interviewed  stakeholders and beneficiaries in the Federal Capital  Territory (Abuja), Lagos and Maiduguri in the north  east part of Nigeria.",neutral,1283
1284,The CPE used a gender-responsive  approach during data collection and analysis of findings. ,neutral,1284
1285,The data collected were organized under each  evaluation question and judgment criteria to establish  a trajectory of results and analysis of medium to  long-term changes.,neutral,1285
1286,These analyses were then drawn  together to offer the eight key conclusions presented in  this report. ,neutral,1286
1287,"This UN Women Country Portfolio Evaluation (CPE)  assessed the evolution, growth trajectory and effec- tiveness of two SN cycles, looking at critical aspects of  women’s empowerment and gender equality in Nigeria.",neutral,1287
1288,"The CPE had two overarching purposes, first, to help  UN Women consolidate learning from what works well  and what could be done differently; second, to offer  evidence-informed insights to support the mid-term  review of the 2018–2020 SN.",neutral,1288
1289,"The CPE examined the implementation of UN Women’s  integrated mandate (over a seven-year period) vis-à-vis  its comparative advantage and the synergies among  thematic areas, particularly in the humanitarian nexus. ",neutral,1289
1290,"This in turn was guided by the analysis of key informant  interviews and triangulated through desk reviews, an  online survey and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). ",neutral,1290
1291,The primary audience for this evaluation includes CO  management and personnel; relevant staff in target  ministries; relevant Civil Society Organizations (CSOs);  donors; target beneficiary communities and groups;  UN agencies involved as partners in joint programmes;  and UN Women regional offices in Western and Central  Africa.,neutral,1291
1292,The CO was demonstrably adept at evolving its  strategic position vis- à-vis gender equality  and women’s empowerment and changing  priorities in the country context.,positive,1292
1293,CONCLUSION 1: UN Women’s strategic positioning  within Nigeria and the choice of interventions were  broadly relevant to GEWE needs; emerging security and  humanitarian issues; and the operating context of its  thematic areas (both at the national and subnational  level).,positive,1293
1294,"Although the balance of thematic priorities  was mainly driven by funding availability, the CO was  broadly doing the right things across its portfolio.",positive,1294
1295,The CO’s normative work is its strongest  comparative advantage.,positive,1295
1296,"CONCLUSION 2: The CO recorded significant achieve- ment in its normative mandates, ensuring that Nigeria  fulfils its international commitments; supporting  the adoption of international instruments; and the  enhancement of gender-responsive systems, laws and  policies.",positive,1296
1297,"However, the process of embedding changes  in policy at the state and local government level was  a daunting task.",negative,1297
1298,"This proved challenging, particularly  as it levied high demand for UN Women resources and  staff time.",negative,1298
1299,The CO was viewed as strong and vocal in  amplifying the voices of women in various  strategic discourses. ,positive,1299
1300,CONCLUSION 3: The CO enjoyed a good degree of  legitimacy in the gender space.,positive,1300
1301,There was near  unanimous recognition that the CO’s advocacy efforts  and closely developed partnerships with a wide range  of stakeholders amplified the voices of women in  various strategic discourses.,positive,1301
1302,"These efforts enhanced the  strategic positioning of the CO’s leadership, which was  viewed as strong and vocal in bringing GEWE issues  to the forefront.",positive,1302
1303,"However, given the size of Nigeria’s  population and the challenges in gender equality, the  same cannot necessarily be said for the CO’s technical  competency and resource capacity.",negative,1303
1304,"This assessment  was occasioned, in part, by a perception of UN Women  as poorly resourced and therefore in some areas lacking  the in-house technical capacity to generate the highest  quality analyses and advisory on emerging GEWE issues  (particularly within a wide range of economic, social  and environmental dimensions). ",negative,1304
1305,Policy level work alone will not stimulate the kind of change required in Nigeria.,neutral,1305
1306,"CONCLUSION 4: The complexity of Nigeria’s three- tiered federalism (the national, state and local  governments), and institutional context, positioned  multi-level interventions as the most strategic and  effective model to stimulate transformative change  across the different levels of governance.",positive,1306
1307,"To a certain  extent, the CO’s approach of combining policy-level  work with state-level interventions proved effective  in consolidating policy gains; building the capacity of  gender machinery; and facilitating the adoption and  popularization of legislative frameworks in target  states. ",positive,1307
1308,"For instance, this approach yielded promising  results in Women, Peace and Security (WPS).",positive,1308
1309,The WPS programme had some impactful  results at the policy and institutional level and in influencing social norm changes. ,positive,1309
1310,"CONCLUSION 5: Significant funding combined with a  multi-year, multi-level and multi-stakeholder approach  enabled UN Women to achieve considerable impact in  the WPS programmatic area and allowed replication  beyond targeted states. ",positive,1310
1311,"However, a more effective  and sustainable outcome would have been achieved  with better planning; earlier identification of suitable  Programme Partners (PPs); and a risk-based plan orga- nized before the start of project implementation.n",negative,1311
1312,"Despite the capacity surge, the CO had a highly constrained staffing structure.",negative,1312
1313,"CONCLUSION 6: Despite a recent capacity surge and  a very committed and dedicated workforce, the CO’s  current ‘staffing structure’ remains antithetical to  building a stable and technically sound team. ",negative,1313
1314,"n this  context, the CO faced difficulties in delivering on its  ambitious SN and in playing a strategic role as a liaison  with ECOWAS.",negative,1314
1315,"Although some internal and external factors were unavoidable, pragmatic and coherent planning could have yielded greater efficiency. ",negative,1315
1316,"CONCLUSION 7: Although some internal and external  factors were unavoidable, pragmatic and coherent  planning could have yielded greater efficiency.",negative,1316
1317,A more  result-oriented approach and strong M&E would have  allowed the CO to better showcase its achievements in  the gender space. was viewed as strong and vocal in,negative,1317
1318,The fragmented nature of some projects both in terms of funding and duration offset long- term benefits and sustainability. ,negative,1318
1319,"CONCLUSION 8: At the policy level, the CO helped  create an environment that enabled the adoption of  gender-friendly legislative frameworks, policies and  strategies, some of which could be attributed to the  long-standing support of UN Women. ",positive,1319
1320,The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the  Empowerment of Women (UN Women) was created  in July 2010 and became operational in January 2011. ,neutral,1320
1321,"The new entity consolidates the mandates of the four  United Nations entities which previously focused  exclusively on gender equality and women’s empow- erment, namely: the Division for the Advancement of  Women (DAW), the Office of the Special Advisor on  Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI),  the International Research and Training Institute  for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW) and  the United Nations Development Fund for Women  (UNIFEM). ",neutral,1321
1322,"In addition to its normative support and  operational functions, UN Women is also responsible  for leading, coordinating and promoting accountabil- ity of the United Nations system in its work on gender  equality and women’s empowerment. ",neutral,1322
1323,The purpose of the evaluation was to: (i) document  and assess the contribution of UN Women and its  predecessor entities to women’s leadership and  participation in peace and security between 2008  and 2012; and (ii) identify lessons learnt and present  forward-looking recommendations.,neutral,1323
1324,"The evaluation  was led by an external independent team and took  place between September 2012 and September 2013,  during which there were two main phases of data col- lection and analysis.",neutral,1324
1325,"To address the evaluation’s objectives and ques- tions, an analytical framework was developed and  was structured around three dimensions, namely:  normative/policy influence; operational impact; and  organizational capacity. ",neutral,1325
1326,These three dimensions were  used to structure and guide the primary and second- ary data collection and analysis in all phases of the  evaluation.,neutral,1326
1327,"he analytical framework of this theory- based evaluation assessed whether UN Women and  predecessor entities achieved planned policy and pro- gramme results, as well as the robustness of explicit or  implicit assumptions about how change is meant to  happen as a result of UN Women’s activities or inputs.",neutral,1327
1328,"The framework integrated key evaluation criteria of  effectiveness and coverage, partnership and coordina- tion, relevance, coherence, impact and sustainability",neutral,1328
1329,A mixed methods approach was used with an empha- sis on qualitative methods,neutral,1329
1330,. Information from different  sources was compared and reconciled to ensure the  triangulation of findings.,neutral,1330
1331,The team consulted over  250 documents and held 217 interviews (39 with UN  Women staff and 178 with other stakeholders).,neutral,1331
1332,"During the desk phase, the team mapped, coded and  quantitatively analysed UN Women and predecessor  entities ’s peace and security and humanitarian re- sponse portfolio between 2008 and 2012",neutral,1332
1333,"It undertook  an in-depth analysis of the results logic and achieve- ments of 12 UN Women and UNIFEM programmes,  and reviewed relevant strategy documents. ",neutral,1333
1334,"During the fieldwork phase, six case studies were  completed including five country studies (Afghanistan,  Colombia, Haiti, Kosovo and Liberia) and a headquar- ters/global policy study",neutral,1334
1335,"During field visits, data was  collected using primary documents, focus groups and  semi-structured key informant interviews among a  wide range of stakeholders.",neutral,1335
1336,A number of limitations were identified during both  the inception and fieldwork phases.,neutral,1336
1337,Those identified  during the inception phase were addressed in the  methodology,neutral,1337
1338,"For example, the period of the evalua- tion coincided with the creation of UN Women and  while the transition to UN Women had been complet- ed, the consolidation of new organizational processes  was still underway",neutral,1338
1339,The evaluation thus took note of  the organizational challenges associated with the  early days of this consolidation process.,neutral,1339
1340,"Furthermore,  the evaluation period straddled two strategic plan- ning periods.",neutral,1340
1341,The evaluation was therefore used to draw les- sons from the experience of predecessor entities on  relevant peace and security work to inform current  and future practice.,neutral,1341
1342,"Also, a full assessment of UN  Women’s humanitarian response (HR) capacity was  not possible as it is a new work area for UN Women,  as noted in the inception phase. ",neutral,1342
1343,It was also considered  important to ensure an appropriate balance in the  assessment of operations and programming vis-à-vis  global policy work. ,neutral,1343
1344,"Therefore, a case study of activities  at headquarters was undertaken, alongside the desk  studies and fieldwork of country-level programming  and operations. ",neutral,1344
1345,"Although primary documents (those  created by UN Women and predecessor entities) were  an important source of data for the evaluation, the  availability and quality of documents at headquarters  and country level varied.",neutral,1345
1346,"Finally, the complex and sensi- tive nature of the peace and security and humanitarian  response agenda means that much of the critical work  is not documented through conventional results- based frameworks",neutral,1346
1347,The qualitative methods used in  fieldwork were therefore appropriate for capturing  achievements and lessons from these environments.,neutral,1347
1348,"The recently approved Strategic Plan 2014-2017 ad- dresses some of the issues identified in this evaluation,  such as medium-term programme planning and an- nual work planning processes.",neutral,1348
1349,"The United Nations mandate for gender equal- ity and women’s empowerment is guided by several  international agreements and commitments, includ- ing the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of  Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the Beijing  Declaration and Platform for Action (1995) and Agreed  Conclusions of the United Nations Economic and Social  Council (1997/2).",neutral,1349
1350,"United Nations Security Council reso- lution 1325 calls for women’s ‘equal participation and  full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and  promotion of peace and security.’ This and subsequent  Security Council resolutions (1820, 1888, 1889 and 1960)  provide the normative mandate for the United Nations’  activities relating to women, peace and security",neutral,1350
1351,"Between 2008 and 2012, women, peace and security  became more prominent in the strategic objectives  of UN Women and its predecessor entities. ",neutral,1351
1352,"Reference  to peace, security and resolution 1325 appeared in  the work plan of OSAGI and DAW in 2010-2011, and in  UNIFEM’s Strategic Plan 2008-2011.",neutral,1352
1353,"In UN Women’s  Strategic Plan 2011-2013, ‘women’s leadership in peace,  security and humanitarian response’ is a strategic goal  and thematic/priority area of work in its own right. ",neutral,1353
1354,An analysis was conducted of former UNIFEM and  UN Women programme documents related to peace  and security activities between 2008 and 2012. ,neutral,1354
1355,"It  highlighted a focus on the following areas (in order  of prominence): violence against women and girls  (particularly conflict-related sexual and gender-based  violence [SGBV]), (18.8 per cent); access to justice  (16.2 per cent); security sector reform (12 per cent);  development of national action plans (monitoring,  implementation and development) under resolution  1325 (10.3 per cent); transitional justice (8.5 per cent);  community-level conflict mediation and prevention  (7.7 per cent); and general post-conflict democratic  governance (6.8 per cent).",neutral,1355
1356,"In the same period, there  were few programming activities that related to peace  negotiations, post-conflict constitution-making, tran- sitional elections, post-conflict recovery, disarmament,  demobilisation and reintegration or human trafficking.",neutral,1356
1357,"OSAGI and DAW led intergovernmental support and  coordination on gender equality issues and gender  mainstreaming within the United Nations, although  DAW did not focus on women, peace and security. ",neutral,1357
1358,"At  the global level, the UN Women Intergovernmental  Support Division and the UN Women United Nations  System Coordination Division now lead work on in- tergovernmental support and coordination activities,  respectively",neutral,1358
1359,"On women, peace and security, the Peace  and Security Section within the UN Women Policy  Division is actively involved in both the normative sup- port function and inter-agency coordination.",neutral,1359

1362,"The activities and programmes of UN Women and its  predecessor entities between 2008 and 2012 contrib- uted to the advancement of women’s leadership and  participation in peace and security – both in terms  of supporting the development of global and na- tional norms and policy, and their implementation by  Member States.",positive,1362
1363,"Between 2008 and 2012, UN Women and its predeces- sor entities contributed significantly to shaping global  policy and norms that advance women’s leadership  and participation in peace and security. ",positive,1363
1364,"evaluation  period was one of intense intergovernmental activity  to advance the women, peace and security agenda.",positive,1364
1365,"In particular, between 2008-2010, OSAGI, DAW and  UNIFEM supported the adoption of three resolutions  on women, peace and security (1820, 1888, 1889); and  since the creation of UN Women, two additional ones  have been agreed (1960, 2106). ",positive,1365
1366,UN Women and its predecessor entities have also  supported the establishment of United Nations-wide  frameworks to monitor and support implementation  of Member State and United Nations commitments on  resolution 1325.,positive,1366

1368,A set of 26 globally-relevant indicators were  developed in 2010 at the request of the Security Council  to monitor the United Nations’ implementation of the  women peace and security resolutions and for volun- tary reporting by Member States.,positive,1368
1369,"Tailored frameworks  addressing specific peace and security activities by  sub-sets of United Nations entities were developed and  integrated into the overall Strategic Results Framework  – for instance, the Secretary General’s Seven-Point Action Plan on gender-responsive Peacebuilding and  the Strategic Framework for United Nations Action  against Sexual Violence in Conflict.",positive,1369
1370," addition, UN  Women and its predecessor entities provided support  to intergovernmental bodies in the implementation  of resolutions on women, peace and security through  analytical and knowledge-building work.",positive,1370
1371,"Although these achievements in normative and in- tergovernmental support predate its creation, the  establishment of a discrete Peace and Security Section  within UN Women is an important factor in continuing  the momentum of work on women, peace and security.",positive,1371
1372,"At the country level, in all five of the country case  studies, UN Women and UNIFEM made important  contributions during the evaluation period to devel- oping national laws and policies to advance work on  women, peace and security.",positive,1372
1373,"These include national  action plans on resolution 1325, laws relating to tran- sitional justice and violence against women, and  gender equality action plans and policies.",positive,1373
1374,"UN Women  and UNIFEM activities helped ensure women’s views  are heard in legislative processes, provided technical  assistance to law-making bodies and developed the  capacity of implementing state bodies.",positive,1374
1375,UN Women and UNIFEM country- level activities also  helped more women to exercise leadership and active- ly participate in processes associated with peace and  security via both direct and indirect support through  country and project offices.,positive,1375
1376,Direct support relates to  activities leading directly to an increase in women’s  leadership and participation in peace and security. ,positive,1376
1377,"Such activities included: facilitating access to national  political, legislative and policymaking processes, includ- ing national peace talks and international conferences;  establishing forums enabling women to participate in  community peacebuilding and security; and increas- ing the number of women leaders, civil servants and  service providers.",positive,1377
1378,Indirect support activities help build the enabling  conditions for women’s leadership and participation. ,positive,1378

1380,"The case studies and supplementary desk study found  that most programme results are reported at the  output and, to a lesser degree, outcome level of the  strategic and project results frameworks.",neutral,1380
1381,There are  some examples of higher-level impact (e.g. increase  in successful prosecutions of SGBV crimes) but coun- try and project offices do not systematically assess  or report on their contribution to these higher levels  of results frameworks or articulate how outputs and  outcomes will lead to them in practice.,negative,1381
1382,The case studies identified organizational features  limiting the normative and operational effectiveness  of all five country and project offices.,negative,1382

2630,"It investigates the scope of cooperation, the factors and measures influencing cooperation, and the effects on persons of concern,  UNHCR, and its partners. ",neutral,2630
2631,"Evidence, collected primarily through four country case studies, suggests that UNHCR has considerably  increased its engagement in humanitarian-development cooperation.",positive,2631
2632,"Not only is there a shift in mind-set, with  UNHCR staff across hierarchies and locations buying into the agenda; there are also diverse examples of practice. ",positive,2632
2633,"With host governments defining how much space there is for cooperation, UNHCR mainly engages in  humanitarian-development cooperation in four ways: by providing different kinds of support to development actors  in order to catalyze their engagement on forced displacement (type 1); by leveraging the influence of development  actors for advocacy on host government policies (type 2); by gradually linking services to national or local systems  (type 3); and by mobilizing development resources to expand UNHCR’s work on self-reliance (type 4).",positive,2633
2634,"While existing practice in the case-study countries shows diverse engagement across these types, the  predominant narrative within UNHCR centers on being a “facilitator” and a “catalyst” for other actors. ",positive,2634
2635,"Accordingly, organizational investments have also focused on UNHCR’s role as a catalyst and facilitator. ",neutral,2635
2636,"There  are, however, examples of important other forms of cooperation and widespread perceptions that additional  opportunities for cooperation exist, particularly with regard to linking services to national systems.",positive,2636
2637,Opinions are  diverging on whether UNHCR should seek funds from development actors to increasingly deliver on self-reliance  itself.,neutral,2637
2638,"In its role as a “catalyst”, UNHCR is not always able to meet the demands of development actors – for  instance, for data and operational protection advice.",negative,2638
2639,"In particular, UNHCR should continue its efforts to expand  its collection and analysis of data on the socio-economic situations of refugees and provide more practical advice  on how to integrate protection into programming. ",positive,2639

2644,"When it comes to expanding work on self-reliance with funds from development  actors, the evaluation found only a small number of programs which, however, have high visibility within UNHCR as  well as among its partners and host governments.",positive,2644
2645,"Despite these indications of positive effects, current experience also suggests that the potential of UNHCR’s  engagement in humanitarian-development cooperation is less transformational than may have been  expected.",negative,2645
2646,"First, UNHCR’s leverage in influencing the strategic orientation of key development actors towards  forced displacement may be limited or dependent on the broader operational and policy context.",negative,2646
2647,"Second, even  where development actors engage, refugees and other persons of concern will require continued operational  support from UNHCR for many areas.",negative,2647
2648," Thus, in cases in which service integration has been achieved, handing over  implementation to development actors has not meant handing over financial responsibilities.",negative,2648

2697,"In addition to providing monetary benefits, GFM  has contributed to improving and streamlining  the ordering, management, and disposal of light  vehicles.",positive,2697
2698, Self-insurance and standardization of  processes are also identified as important  benefits accrued through the GFM Scheme.,positive,2698
2699,"The UNHCR vehicle self-insurance scheme  provides low cost, comprehensive insurance  coverage for damage and loss.",positive,2699

2706,"Notably, of the claims  closed without payment 73 percent were due to  lack of proper documentation.",negative,2706
2707,"Another important benefit of the GFM is vehicle  standardization which increases efficiency and  reduces costs related to management, training,  maintenance and repairs because vehicles are  fitted with the same components and equipment. ",positive,2707
2708,"Overall, GFM offers 10 models (Toyota and  Nissan) with 49 different specifications (e.g., left  or right driving, engine configuration).",positive,2708
2709,"Initially set at 33.84 percent of the total  procurement cost, the yearly rental fee  decreased to 19 percent in 2018.",positive,2709
2710,Staff consulted  in country operations consider the rental amount to be a fair. ,positive,2710
2711,"Over the five-year leasing period,  rental fees cover 95 percent of the total  procurement cost and, when combined with  revenue generated by vehicle disposal, this total  exceeds the original vehicle acquisition cost. ",neutral,2711
2712,"In  theory, this makes GFM self-sustaining. ",positive,2712
2713,"In addition to monetary benefits accrued through  the internal rental scheme, the centralization of  the fleet management function resulted in a  more simplified and standardized procurement  process for light vehicles.",positive,2713
2714,"This process appears to  work well overall: in general, country operations  note that the time they spend procuring vehicles  has decreased in comparison with the pre-GFM  period and that communication with GFM during  the ordering process is clear and efficient.",positive,2714
2715,Country operations reported some confusion  about a few aspects of the process.,negative,2715

2717,"Before the introduction of GFM, country  operations sometimes made arbitrary vehicle  disposal decisions and many vehicles were given  to government or NGO partners through a  Transfer of Ownership (ToO), or were sold at a  low price through direct sales.",neutral,2717
2718,The centralization  of light vehicle disposal has led to standardized  disposal processes across country operations and  to a reduction in ToO and direct sales.,positive,2718
2719,"Despite  this, country operations and UNCHR partners  resist returning retired vehicles and there is a gap  of approximately 50 percent between the  number of vehicles identified for disposal and the  number turned in.",negative,2719
2720,"Considering GFM brings in  about 1,000 new vehicles each year, and that  GFM will start disposal of GFM rental vehicles as  of 2019, closing this gap is essential.",negative,2720
2721,"Centralized disposal has had two positive,  unexpected results.",positive,2721
2722,"First, auctions are used to  dispose of other items such as vehicle spare parts  and office furniture and equipment.",positive,2722
2723,"Between  2015 and 2017, revenues generated from this  new practice totalled USD 3.1 million.",positive,2723
2724,"Second, since 2016, three UN agencies (WFP,  FAO, UNON) and international non-governmental  organizations (INGOs) have used GFM’s services  to dispose of vehicles and other assets.",positive,2724
2725,"Through  these joint auctions, GFM generated net revenue  of USD 3.4 million for its partners.",positive,2725
2726,"Considering  the strong desire of the UN System to work as one  and avoid duplication among UN agencies,  UNCHR’s well-defined niche in conducting public  auctions may represent an unprecedented  opportunity for UNCHR to become the go-to  agency for the disposal of vehicles across the UN  and humanitarian NGOs.",positive,2726
2727,Another benefit of GFM is a decrease in the  average age of UNHCR’s fleet of light vehicles. ,positive,2727
2728,"Thanks to the implementation of the disposal  policy, the average fleet age decreased from 5.22  years in 2013 to 3.86 years in 2017.",positive,2728

2730,The evaluation attempted to  verify the hypothesis that reduced fleet age leads  to a decrease in operating costs.,neutral,2730
2731,"Data from the  Colombia operation seem to suggest that there is  a correlation, but the evaluation team lacks data  to fully confirm this hypothesis. ",neutral,2731
2732,GFM provides valuable support to country  operations and communication is generally fluid  during all steps of the vehicle procurement and  disposal processes. ,positive,2732

2734,"The evaluation found that many  country operations staff do not fully understand  the GFM rental scheme, despite information  having been disseminated and being available on  the UNHCR intranet.",negative,2734
2735,"Finally, an important GFM objective was to  improve the road safety awareness of UNHCR  staff and partners.",neutral,2735
2736,The evaluation found that  drivers know they are now being monitored by  the VTS and therefore have adopted safer  behaviors.,positive,2736

2738,Country  operations have not yet put in place all the  processes to effectively use the tracking system  and its data.,negative,2738
2739,"While GFM has led to many positive changes in  the way UNHCR manages its fleet of light  vehicles, the evaluation noted concerns about  limited fleet management skills in-country and  vehicle lead time (total time between the  moment the vehicle is ordered from the  manufacturer until it is delivered to UNHCR  facilities). ",negative,2739
2740,"Although the light vehicle disposal process  generates revenues, GFM must follow a complex  process whereby it must seek approval from  UNHCR’s Programme Budget Service (PBS) to  transfer the revenues it generates to its annual  Operating Plan budget. ",negative,2740
2741,"GFM staff feel that this  process is complex and time consuming and that  not all revenues have been credited GFM  budgets. Between 2015 and 2017, the difference  between revenues collected by GFM and those  credited to its account represented a loss of  USD 9,883,785. ",negative,2741

2746,Another issue hampering the full functioning of  GFM is that light vehicle management does not  appear to be an operational priority for country  operations.,negative,2746
2747,"Although some administrators at the  HQ level are advocating for better fleet  management, the benefits and potential cost  savings are not yet clear to staff at all  organizational levels. ",negative,2747

3892,"The evaluation found that UNHCR’s decision to consider phasing down operations and its presence in  Angola, Botswana and Namibia implicitly leveraged specific opportunities for phasing down that  these countries offered at the time. ",positive,3892
3893,"In particular, numbers of persons of concern had already decreased  in preceding years and a significant additional decrease was anticipated, as the majority had found, or  were about to realize, a durable solution. ",positive,3893
3894,"There were assumptions made about the ability and  willingness of governments and other partners to assume responsibilities and take over from  UNHCR, as well as about the transfer of residual responsibilities to the Regional Office in  Pretoria in the context of the regionalization policy.

3895,"Nevertheless, when the 2013 decision was made, the intended outcomes were formulated only in  terms of office structures and presences.",negative,3895
3896,"The decision did not include a transparent analysis of  underlying assumptions and preconditions that could have guided field offices; as a result, appropriate  strategies, with clear indicators, operational milestones and roadmaps were not developed based on such analyses; and could not be used to support the review of progress in subsequent years. ",negative,3896
3897,"Furthermore, translating UNHCR’s mandate, and role, into more tangible standards or benchmarks  proved challenging, and in the absence of strategies and roadmaps, offices came up with their own  interpretations of the decision, and defined their own benchmarks and plans and processes for  implementation.",negative,3897
3898,"Where offices developed comprehensive phase down plans, there was no agreed,  robust mechanism to monitor progress. ",negative,3898

3900,"In practice, most planning assumptions did not hold up.",negative,3900
3901,"The numbers of persons of concern did not  decrease, anticipated durable solutions did not materialize, and major gaps remained in the creation of  conditions for hand-over of responsibilities to governments and other partners.",negative,3901
3902,"While concerns about  protection and solutions benchmarks were raised by different staff and stakeholders involved in the  phase down process, the main focus remained on reducing expenditures regardless of whether it  affected protection or durable solutions outcomes. ",negative,3902

3906,extent to which reduction in overall expenditures  was attributable to the 2013 decision cannot be calculated due to limited tracking of resources that went toward the phasing down process and of the unintended additional costs and liabilities it  generated. ,negative,3906
3907,"In terms of lessons learned, the evaluation has shown that a decision to phase down UNHCR presence  ought to be preceded by a robust situational analysis, assessing international commitments and  obligations together with capacities and abilities of different stakeholders, and that these should benefit  from government and partner consultations and include an agreed-on time frame.",negative,3907
3908,"Furthermore, there  are strong indications that closing down UNHCR’s presence in a country may require a concentrated  and controlled deployment of additional resources before and during the transition. ",negative,3908
3909,"n other words,  ending UNHCR’s presence per se should not be seen necessarily as a cost-saving measure in the short  term.",negative,3909
3910,"Rather, in operational terms, the phasing out of office presence should mirror the opening of a  country presence which is often part of an emergency response: costly, tightly monitored, involving  additional experienced staff and resources, following an agreed basic planning scenario, with a clear  vision of end results (including measurable indicators, benchmarks and other progress measurements)  and implemented with the appropriate level of transparency and accountability. ",negative,3910
3911," such, the evaluation  is recommending further guidance for phasing down which should support offices to sufficiently capture  the complexity and organizational choices for engagement in each context and go beyond numerical  calculation of persons of concern/staff ratios as a parameter for decisions on budgeting and staffing. ",negative,3911
3912,"Informed by these experiences with phasing down, it is recommended that UNHCR should reconsider  the issue of responsible closure of country presence not as a sudden decision, often precipitated by a  lack of funding, but rather as an essential and natural part of its operational life cycle globally, and a  reflection of States’ responsibility for international protection.",negative,3912
3913,"For this to happen, UNHCR should re- focus on the essentially temporary and time-limited nature of its presence in a country in the context of  supporting the development of the responsibilities and capabilities of the host State. ",negative,3913

4787,An abridged version of the  conclusions and recommendations appears below; the full version can be found in Chapter 5.,neutral,4787
4788,"Conclusion 1: After a decade of work in this area, conceptual clarity on child protection  systems strengthening in UNICEF is still incomplete. ",negative,4788
4789,"As a result, there is a lack of shared  understanding around CPSS among UNICEF staff at various levels, and with partners. ",negative,4789
4790,"At the most basic level, there is no official UNICEF definition of child protection systems  strengthening that is positioned as such, published and widely shared across all levels of the  organization.",negative,4790
4791,"Second, a clear conceptual framework or programme-impact pathway with  associated measurements is missing. ",negative,4791
4792,Conclusion 2: Staff lack technical support on operationalizing the CP systems- strengthening approach in different programming contexts and against the backdrop of  large issue-based initiatives and VAC as the unifying umbrella concept.,negative,4792
4793,The desired balance and connection between UNICEF’s issue-based and systems approaches  to child protection has not been spelled out.,negative,4793
4794,"A related operational challenge is the relationship  between the systems-strengthening approach and work to address violence against children,  which has been positioned as the unifying umbrella concept in SDG 16.2 and SP Goal Area 3. ",negative,4794
4795,"More generally, there is little clarity or systematic evidence on how to choose the best entry  point for CPSS. ",negative,4795
4796,"Finally, UNICEF’s programmatic approach to CPSS has so far not distinguished  between different levels of functioning or maturity of national CP systems.",negative,4796
4797,Conclusion 3: UNICEF has had considerable success in advancing the child protection  systems agenda at the national level and in raising awareness among national partners. ,positive,4797
4798,"However, by and large, this has not translated into adequate domestic investments in  CPSS.",negative,4798
4799,"In most countries reviewed as part of this evaluation, UNICEF’s role in evidence generation,  systems mapping and assessments, and costing of child protection systems has helped to  change the understanding of government partners. ",positive,4799
4800,UNICEF technical support has also helped  to improve key components of CP systems. ,positive,4800
4801,"However, in most cases, this shared understanding  has not resulted in resource commitments from governments. ",negative,4801
4802,Conclusion 4: Donors have played a largely negative role in advancing national CP  systems by distributing funding on a narrow issue-by-issue basis and using parallel  monitoring and reporting systems. ,negative,4802
4803,The organization has so far failed to present key  donors with a compelling ‘business case’ for child protection systems strengthening.,negative,4803
4804,Many donors primarily require readily- and quickly-measurable results expressed in terms of  numbers of children benefitted. ,neutral,4804
4805,This has led to favouring parallel service-delivery systems that  undermine systems-strengthening.,negative,4805
4806,"UNICEF staff are therefore challenged to design projects  that meet donor expectations for high numbers of early beneficiaries, while also contributing to  broad and lasting development results in terms of a robust CP system.",negative,4806
4807,Conclusion 5: UNICEF’s programme performance on CPSS has been moderate overall.,negative,4807
4808,"Progress was uneven, with stark gaps in low-income, fragile and humanitarian contexts. ",negative,4808
4809,"In many of the countries examined, UNICEF contributed to a moderate, verifiable level of  progress toward strengthening the six dimensions that together make up functioning CP  systems.",positive,4809
4810,"However, there is still a long way to go in most of the countries reviewed.",negative,4810
4811,UNICEF’s  contribution to CPSS has been particularly strong with regard to strengthening the legal and  regulatory framework.,positive,4811
4812,"In general, UNICEF support was less successful where child protection  systems were embryonic and more successful in countries where UNICEF supported the  government-led reform of existing child protection systems.",negative,4812
4813,"Conclusion 6: The evaluation has identified a number of interventions that are  particularly effective for strengthening CP systems, including capacity-building/social  workforce strengthening, leveraging public resources, evidence and research and policy  advocacy. ",positive,4813
4814,This provides some clarity on priority investments for UNICEF. ,positive,4814
4815,"Stronger child protection systems benefit most from UNICEF investments in evidence and  research, leveraging public resources, and policy advocacy.",positive,4815
4816,"Investments in capacity-building  (including workforce strengthening) made the biggest difference across the entire set of 24  countries, suggesting that this intervention is worthwhile in a wide range of contexts.",positive,4816
4817,"In  countries with weaker CP systems, UNICEF often invests significantly in community-based child  protection mechanisms and provides direct financial and technical support for child protection  services and infrastructure. ",positive,4817
4818,"Conclusion 7: UNICEF’s ambitions for what a child protection system can be expected to  accomplish in specific contexts, and in what timeframe, have not been realistic. ",negative,4818
4819,"Some of UNICEF’s objectives in terms of child protection systems strengthening are oriented to  the short- and medium-term, whereas achieving functional child protection systems is a highly  ambitious long-term goal.",negative,4819
4820,"This may have led to ‘over-selling’ and ‘under-delivering’ on systems- strengthening efforts in some contexts, which may in turn have undermined partners’ confidence  in CPSS. ",negative,4820
4821,"Relatedly, in better functioning systems, child protection results often rely on a  network of allied health, education and social protection systems that shoulder the main burden  of prevention and early intervention.",negative,4821
4822,"Conclusion 8: UNICEF has a clear niche focusing on state accountabilities for children’s  rights and partnering with government departments at national, provincial and district  levels.",positive,4822
4823,"However, the organization has yet to define its role with regard to children’s  participation, community-based child protection mechanisms and coordination between  formal and less formal actors.",negative,4823
4824,"In terms of the ideal programme-impact pathway for CPSS, the dichotomy between formal and  less formal child protection structures may have been overstated.",negative,4824
4825,"As the QCA findings showed,  in some of the countries with functioning child protection systems, UNICEF also successfully  invests in community-based child protection mechanisms.",positive,4825
4826,"Investing in children’s civil rights (to  information, communication, association and civic engagement in child protection systems) may  be an area of opportunity with regard to the participation of girls and boys in CPSS.",negative,4826
4827,Conclusion 9: Investments in staff capacities and learning for CPSS have been  insufficient.,negative,4827
4828,"In some countries and regions, experienced UNICEF staff have been able to provide strong  strategic leadership to mobilize donors, governments and other implementing agencies to  advance the systems agenda in creative ways.",positive,4828
4829,"However, many countries lack this capacity.",negative,4829
4830,"The  skill set needed for CPSS goes beyond what is typically found in CP staff, and includes public  finance, institutional development, results-based management, research/analytical skills and  strategic leadership (convening, persuading and influencing).",negative,4830
4831,"These competencies do not seem  xiii to have been sufficiently considered in hiring, promotion and retention of staff as well as in  learning initiatives.",negative,4831
4832,Conclusion 10: UNICEF’s corporate reporting systems on expenditures and results are  inadequate to demonstrate the exact level of UNICEF’s contribution.,negative,4832
4833,"Coherent corporate-level metrics for CPSS are yet to be established, both at the level of the  intermediate outcomes (elements of the CP system) and at the level of UNICEF expenditures  and investments contributing to these outcomes.",negative,4833
4834,"For the 2014-2017 period in particular, it has  been difficult to assess investments, as it is unclear which ones were considered “systems  strengthening” at CO level when expenditures were recorded.",negative,4834
4835,"Evidence from UNICEF’s  corporate results reporting systems, while markedly improved as part of the SP, 2018-2021,  remain patchy.",negative,4835
4836,"All in all, UNICEF lacks the ability to systematically track its contribution to CPSS  progress and performance globally, which hinders the organization from demonstrating results  and mobilizing resources for CPSS. ",negative,4836
4837,"The purpose of the evaluation was twofold: 1) to evaluate the effectiveness of the UNICEF’s Early Childhood  Development (ECD) kit interventions on children’s psychosocial well-being, early learning and development in a  humanitarian context; and 2) to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of different approaches for improving  caregiver interactions with children and the use of the ECD kits for early learning and development.

4854,"The rationale for the enhanced intervention included a desire of  the national government to harmonize and standardize their ECD trainings to improve the quality of all ECD  learning settings, regardless of delivery model or implementing organization.",neutral,4854
4855,It was also based upon the  recognition that additional training in the ECD neurosciences would elevate caregiver and parent understandings  of the importance of early childhood and of play in supporting child development.,neutral,4855

5013,A Background Approximately 50 million children can be considered ‘on the move’. ,neutral,5013
5014,"Of these approximately 13 million are child refugees, 936,000 are  asylum-seeking children, and 17 million children have been forcibly  displaced inside their own country (Bhabha and Abel, 2019;  International Organization for Migration (IOM), 2020). ",neutral,5014
5015,Other  children considered ‘on the move’ include migrants and returnees.,neutral,5015
5016,"Children are among the most vulnerable groups of migrant and displaced populations,  facing risks to their survival, health and education, and more likely to experience  violence, exploitation or abuse.",neutral,5016
5017,"Children experiencing violence “often find themselves  running alongside violence on their journeys, rather than leaving it behind them”  (United Nations, 2019, p. 15), while those primarily displaced by other factors face  new risks.",neutral,5017
5018,"In addition to their age, the very fact of being displaced – often without  documentation, and unable to speak the language of their destination – combined with  economic need increases vulnerability to abuse and exploitation and, often, xenophobic  discrimination (ibid.).",neutral,5018
5019,"Many of these risks vary by age and gender, with boys and girls  facing different levels and types of risks in terms of violence, trafficking, child labour  and child marriage (United Nations, 2019), while children and adolescents with disabil- ities, and adolescents and youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/ questioning/intersex (LGBTQI) face discrimination that overlays and intersects with these  risks.",neutral,5019
5020,"Moreover, children who move on their own often lack safe and regular options to  reunite with family members (UNICEF, n.d.).",neutral,5020
5021,The context and nature of movement affects these risks.,neutral,5021
5022,"For example, migrants in transit  are exposed to sexual and gender-based violence (GBV), forced labour, extortion and  exploitation, among other abuses (IOM, 2020); while economic deprivation among  refugees and internally displaced people increases the likelihood of engagement in  hazardous or exploitative child labour and, in some contexts, of forced and early child  marriage (United Nations, 2019).",neutral,5022
5023,Education is disrupted (sometimes for long periods  of time) and affects learning outcomes of children on the move. ,neutral,5023
5024,"Where emergency  education services are provided, they are often of low quality (Nicolai et al., 2020) and  many children never return to formal schooling (ibid.).",neutral,5024

5342,"While the EE section has been focused on re-estab- lishing thought leadership on the organization’s  TOC, space for responsive (demand-led) program- ming support to the decentralized offices has been  restricted.",negative,5342
5343, This has now been recognized as a strategic  weakness for the organization.,negative,5343
5344,"A consequence of  this, evident from the case studies, is that COs lack  information about WEE work taking place outside  of their region and require significantly more policy  support and technical guidance from HQ in order to  strengthen their efforts to advance WEE.",negative,5344
5345,"In addressing  this, the evaluation identifies promising approaches to  knowledge management and capacity development. ",neutral,5345
5346,"The evaluation identified a number of areas where  there is a potential for organizational learning, scaling  up and replication across UN Women work on WEE at  global, regional and country levels. ",neutral,5346
5347,Lessons learned  relate to UN Women work at the micro-level with  women entrepreneurs; the importance of addressing  social norms that hinder participation of women in  economic and social sphere; the power of platforms  that allow interface between women-led grass-roots  organizations and decision makers to enhance under- standing about their needs and priorities; and the  need for a multidimensional and integrated approach  to WEE. ,negative,5347

5360,Meso-level policy advocacy (such as to promote  women’s access to agricultural credit and infrastruc- ture investment in ways that reduce women’s care  burden) would be an important corollary of this work.,neutral,5360
5361,Expanding UN Women work in this domain would  require new partnerships (including additional funds  to enable UN Women to influence and enter partner- ships through joint programmes) and significant  capacity development (in particular training and  guidance tools for regional and country-level staff  working on WEE).,neutral,5361

5375,"A more promising approach looks to  be a combination of existing fora, a WEE community  an empowered future summary 18 of practice, and guidance on using the SWAP (and  gender scorecards) to promote accountability in  relation to WEE.",negative,5375
5376,UN Women’s leadership and role  in existing coordination fora (such as Inter-agency  Network on Women and Gender Equality [IANWGE]  at the HQ level and the UN resident coordinator  system and UNDAF working groups at the country  level) is already producing important results in  terms of an increased number of joint programmes  and UNDAFs that are effectively gender-responsive.,positive,5376
5377,Analysis of UN Women’s comparative advantages  finds that it has significant expertise in convening  and facilitating multi-stakeholder groups.,positive,5377
5378,"Combined  with a strong demand for it to assume a leadership  position in relation to broader coordination of WEE  efforts, there is a strong case for the entity to take  a more inclusive approach to its coordination role  by creating platforms for participatory dialogue  and collaboration.",negative,5378
5379,CONCLUSION 6: The principle means by which UN Women can enhance its effectiveness is through its partnerships.,positive,5379
5380,Becoming more strategic and selective will be critical.,negative,5380
5381,"There is very limited scope for planning based on  raising large increases in financial resources, espe- cially within the structurally underfunded gender  sector and doing so also places UN Women in direct  competition with the very organizations that it is  seeking to build alliances with.

5382,Partnerships offer  a more sustainable and more scalable route to  extending UN Women capacity,negative,5382
5383,"While it is promising  to see increased instances of partnerships in support  of WEE (particularly through the Knowledge Gateway  and the post-2015 process), UN Women also needs  to be more strategic and selective in ensuring that  the parameters, expectations and contributions of  its partnerships are clearly defined.

5384,"The organization  is also learning that different types of partnerships  require different modes of thinking, including when  they relate to different thematic areas.",positive,5384
5385,CONCLUSION 7: UN Women’s operational work makes  the most effective contribution where it identifies  and addresses structural barriers and bottlenecks to  women’s realization of their economic and social rights.,positive,5385
5386,"A great deal of UN Women’s micro-level work is  currently designed to solve economic problems faced  by women—provide direct access to better skills,  credit products, market opportunities, information  and other services. ",neutral,5386
5387,"A great deal has been learned  from this work, including through the FGE.",positive,5387
5388,But the  limited scope for impact in comparison to opera- tional work at the meso- and macro-levels suggests  that the time has come to revise the approach:  micro-level work needs to sit within a bigger picture  and contribute evidence towards shifting structural  bottlenecks to WEE. ,negative,5388
5389,UN women should be highly  selective in its micro-level work and focus strongly  on how it will provide evidence and data about  structural barriers to women’s realization of their  economic and social rights.,negative,5389
5390,"CONCLUSION 8: Women’s economic, social and cultural  rights stand in a disadvantaged position in relation  to the dominant political economic paradigm.",neutral,5390
5391,"In this  context, UN Women needs to mobilize and give voice  to all the allies it can—including men, civil society, and  the private sector—from the position of legal authority  that human rights frameworks provide.",negative,5391
5392,The evaluation found that UN Women’s recent shift  towards a rights-based approach for its work on  WEE (which approaches WEE in terms of constraints  and discrimination) positions the entity well to add  value to other existing efforts in this area.,positive,5392
5393,"Given the  challenges that UN Women has faced in articulating  and communicating a coherent rights-based notion  of WEE, it may be useful for the entity to reframe its  work in terms of women’s economic and social rights.",negative,5393
5394,"Evidence from UN Women’s operational work suggests  that the realization of women’s economic and social  rights needs to include strengthening rights-holding  groups to better organize, document and voice their  positions in national processes.",negative,5394
5395,The organization has  also recognized that increased engagement with  men and boys is needed at a country level in order  to increase understanding and cultural support for  women’s economic rights.,negative,5395

5397,"To enhance its institutional ability to contribute  to WEE, there is now a need to consolidate inwards and  strengthen a consistent approach to WEE-related leader- ship at all levels within the organization.",negative,5397
5398,"While UN Women has recently initiated a process to  inclusively map out a comprehensive TOC for WEE,  this effort has been delayed due to several factors,  including internal transition, constrained human  resources (including time), and an extremely chal- lenging external context (including resistance to  a rights-based approach and competing economic  philosophies).

6414,"This is slightly above the UN average, but the actual figure varies from one agency to the next.",neutral,6414
6415,"Some 90% of WHO NPOs operate at country level, where they represent 27% of WHO country level staff. ",neutral,6415
6416,"Moreover, 5% of NPOs are also found at Regional Office (RO) level and the remaining 5% essentially in the Global Service Centre (GSC) under the HQ Major Office.",neutral,6416
6417,In terms of the experience and expertise they bring: The NPO age distribution is similar to that across WHO and their tenure at WHO is not markedly different to that of IPs.,neutral,6417
6418,"NPOs typically have high academic achievements and previous work experience, often in their home country’s MoH. ",neutral,6418
6419,"In terms of their contribution to a variety of WHO programmatic outcomes and outputs: NPOs work across a wide range of categories, most notably Communicable Diseases (for 28% of NPOs) and Polio Eradication (for 19% of NPOs).",neutral,6419
6420,"The programmatic focus varies greatly from one Country Office to the next, however.",neutral,6420
6421,"In terms of the function they fulfil: At country level NPOs play a key role in facilitating policy implementation, capacity-building and monitoring activities, whereas they fulfil enabling services and corporate functions at RO and HQ major office levels.",positive,6421
6422,"With regard to the relevance of the role itself as defined by the ICSC, the evaluation found that  WHO practice in using NPOs has evolved since the creation of the role.",positive,6422
6423,"n a number of respects, current practice constitutes a departure from the eligibility criteria.",neutral,6423
6424,"Although similar inconsistencies  with the ICSC eligibility criteria exist in other UN agencies, this departure questions whether the role  as defined by the ICSC is fit for purpose to meet WHO’s objectives.",neutral,6424
6425,"In analysis of NPO demographics as part of this evaluation question, the evaluation noted that there  is lower female representation amongst NPOs than there is among IPs (37% vs 45%), and the NPO  gender parity varies across regions and programmes. ",negative,6425
6426,WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS AND ADDED VALUE OF NPOS IN COUNTRIES IN RELATION TO ACHIEVING RESULTS AT COUNTRY LEVEL? ,neutral,6426
6427,"NPOs are deemed to make a unique contribution to WHO, providing specific value-add in support  of WHO operations.",positive,6427
6428,"They can be considered in many cases to be a cost-effective resource solution,  although there are constraints and limitations on how they can be utilised.",positive,6428
6429,"The unique contributions of NPO staff, asidentified by stakeholders, can be classified into seven key attributes: language; cultural fit; geographical knowledge and access; institutional knowledge of the country’s health system; network within MoH, government and society at large; continuity of presence in a country; and social proximity to national health outcomes: translated into a specific commitment and dedication to the role. ",positive,6429
6430,"These attributes provide a potential value-add in terms of service orientation towards the MoH, access to key national health forums, access to affected populations and areas, situational awareness and relevance, and an overall ability to tailor WHO’s response to the country context.",positive,6430
6431,"Overall, this contributes to improving WHO’s overall effectiveness and impact at country level.",positive,6431
6432,"The cost-effectiveness of the NPO role was assessed in terms of: (1) the NPO role’s work content relative to the grade requirements, and (2) cost relative to equivalent positions in a country. ",neutral,6432
6433,"NPOs perform tasks that are beyond those defined in the Master Standard for the classification of Professionals, at a cost that was consistently found to be significantly less than the equivalent IP role.",positive,6433
6434,"However, the evaluation also showed that the NPO salaries are significantly higher than local salaries for comparable jobs, which can create inadequate incentives for NPOs to return to their previous employers or pursue mobility outside of WHO. ",negative,6434
6435,"There are also considerations for and restrictions on the utilisation of the NPO role, notably relating to: o the need for clear boundaries between the MoH and WHO; o the perceived credibility of NPOs in the eyes of the MoH; o the importance of bringing fresh thinking to WHO and the MoH, which a long tenure and lack of international exposure might not provide; o the importance for WHO to maintain its global, multilateral nature; o the duty of care for staff in security compromised settings; and o the potential attrition of talent (“brain drain”), although this issue is not specific to the NPO role. ",negative,6435
6436,WHAT ARE THE MAIN OVERLAPS AND COMPLEMENTARITIES BETWEEN THE ROLES OF NPOS AND IPS IN COUNTRY OFFICES?,neutral,6436
6437,"There are areas of overlap between the roles of NPOs and IPs, which have emerged organically.",neutral,6437
6438,"It is  possible that some level of overlap is advantageous, alongside the key areas of complementarity  that these roles offer.",positive,6438
6439,The arbitration of these roles should be guided by a clear framework based on WHO’s operational resource needs.,neutral,6439
6440,"However, in the absence of such guidance the choice is typically based on judgement and on budgetary considerations.",negative,6440
6441,"This represents a considerable risk, given the constraints on NPO utilisation and the lost opportunities to optimise the resource solution for WHO’s needs. ",negative,6441
6442,"There are notable complementarities between the NPO and IP roles in countries, which highlight the benefits of a mixed-resource model and collaborative working between staff groups. ",positive,6442
6443,"There is more permeability between staff roles(GS and those on Special Service Agreements, or SSAs, NPO and IP) than originally anticipated by ICSC, despite WHO policies thus far being relatively restrictive of such transitions as well as the absence of systematic WHO-wide facilitation of such moves.",positive,6443
6444,"AS WHO MOVES TOWARDS MORE FOCUSED AND EFFECTIVE COUNTRY-BASED OPERATIONS, WHAT IS THE FUTURE ROLE OF NPOS? WHAT SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS ROLE? ",neutral,6444
6445,"NPOs have a key role to play in WHO’s future, as WHO pursues more focus on country-level impact.",positive,6445
6446,"In  order to realise the potential of this part of the workforce and deliver sustainable contributions to WHO’s role in improving national health outcomes, the NPO role and its requisite skills and  competencies will need to evolve, overcoming organisational barriers and leveraging management  enablers. ",negative,6446
6447,"An analysis of WHO policy instruments identified five relevant factors that should shape the nature and ways of working in WHO Country Offices (WCOs): 1) WCOs are pivotal in demonstrating results orientation and accountability; 2) WHO’s role and WCO presence should be tailored to specific country needs and priorities; nonetheless, 3) some crosscutting needs can be identified to strengthen the WHO’s response in areas of priority; 4) in a context of reform and transformation, WCOs need more capabilities in the areas of external and internal collaboration, coordination and integration; and 5) WCOs are essential in promoting principles- based approaches. ",negative,6447
6448,"These five drivers, which affect the future of WCOs, have implications for the NPO roles, skills and competencies.",neutral,6448
6449,"The changing job profile requirements were corroborated by NPOs, NPO supervisors and WRs, although there were differences in the perspectives of the NPOs and NPO supervisors regarding the relative importance of improvements in specific areas of skills.",positive,6449
6450,"NPOs have the potential to contribute significantly to the changing context of the WCOs, e.g. in tailoring WHO’s response to country-specific needs, but some adaptation is required if the NPO role’s strengths are to remain relevant and role limitations are to be mitigated.",negative,6450
6451,People management and HR practices present both barriers and opportunities for the optimisation of the NPO workforce segment.,neutral,6451
6452,Recruitment can be improved to ensure the right mix of competencies and candidates.,negative,6452
6453,"Whilst there are positive practices in promoting diversity and inclusion, a continued focus is needed in this area.",negative,6453
6454,Performance management is a key challenge for WHO and professional development could hold the key to addressing it.,negative,6454
6455,There are opportunities to review and strengthen career progression and mobility practices specifically for this part of the workforce.,negative,6455
6456,"There are mixed views about the best training and development approaches; however, the growing practice of short-term assignments outside the home country seems particularly beneficial.",positive,6456
6457,Performance management is not well utilised currently; it is not leveraged to build on high performance or used to addresslow performance.,negative,6457
6458,"“enabling environment” for NPOs, with some potential to review the experience of “fairness” and equal opportunities.",negative,6458
6459,Eight main reasons were given to explain reluctance to move: “family/spouse  considerations” (81%); “no suitable positions for my professional profile” (59%); “higher security risks”  (57%); “low or less attractive living conditions in general” (51%); lack of promotion opportunities”  (48%); “limited education/schooling options” (46%); “limited health care options” (42%); and “lower  financial entitlements/allowances” (38%).,neutral,6459
