neutral,"It is estimated that 63 percent of the land in Mexico is affected by some type of degradation, and its fertility loss is one of its primary deterioration factors.",0
neutral,The main direct causes of degradation include changes in soil use and deforestation.,1
neutral,The Mexican Government has implemented different programmes to reverse this situation.,2
neutral,"However, barriers prevail that have hindered the implementation of sustainable land management (SLM) practices.",3
neutral,"Some of the barriers identified include the limited capacities for SLM-focused integrated land management, the differences between the instruments that regulate land use and the difficulty that local stakeholders – interested in managing natural resources and in SLM – face when it comes to accessing financing.",4
neutral,"Within this context, the objective of the project Promotion of Sustainable Land Management (known as PROTIERRAS) was to reduce land degradation by implementing a land management model focussed on sustainable land management and on strengthening local institutions, which in three priority micro-regions would facilitate the concurrence of multi-sectoral policies and investments in public assets.",5
neutral,"The project was implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and executed with the support of the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT). The project was financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), which granted USD 1 735 160 for the implementation of the project, with proposed co-financing of USD 8 746 566. ",6
neutral,"Following the GEF requirements, a final evaluation was conducted of the PROTIERRAS project, which covered the period from November 2016 – when it began – to October 2019, its scheduled completion date.",7
neutral,"The final evaluation had two main objectives: i) accountability, to respond to the information requirements and interests of the policy makers and other stakeholders with decision-making duties, including the government, the donor and FAO; and ii) to increase knowledge, to identify lessons that may be included in future FAO, government and donor programmes.",8
positive,The final evaluation findings show that the project was aligned with the 2013-2018 national priorities of the Federal Government and with the GEF and FAO key objectives and strategies.,9
positive,"However, during the implementation of the project, there was a cut in the Federal Government of Mexico’s budget, which substantially limited the participation of SEMARNAT in the project.",10
positive,This resulted in a lack of government leadership of the project on the ground; a burden of work for the local technical agencies (LTA) and limited fulfilment of the co-financing pledged by the environmental sector. ,11
positive,"The design of the PROTIERRAS project was innovative and inclusive and offered an effective alternative that converged the multi-sectoral policies of the three levels of government and empowered local stakeholders to make decisions and contribute, in an informed manner, to sustainable land management. ",12
positive,"In addition, it facilitated the implementation of SLM practices that also had an impact on the productive systems to avoid land degradation.",13
negative,"The primary areas for improvement identified in relation to the project's design include the formulation of the objective, which was classified as ambitious because it led to the understanding that the project would manage to reduce land degradation in terms of physical, biological and chemical changes in the soil.",14
negative,"onsequently, the project was dismissed by several people interviewed who considered it unrealistic in its scope, and this led to the Project Coordination Unit  9999888776-executive ix (PCU) taking soil parameter measurements in the reference sites and proposing an  indicators matrix, activities not included in the Project Document (PRODOC).",15
positive,"With regard to the effectiveness in obtaining the project outcomes, the vast majority of outcome and output indicator targets were met, some were even exceeded.",16
positive," In particular, the target of the indicator Area under integrated land management practices, with a final target of 3 800 ha, was exceeded by more than double the number of hectares.",17
negative,"However, the indicator Amount of investment in integrated land management with a target of USD 8 524 995, was only 63 percent fulfilled.",18
negative,As regards the Land Management Model – one of the main project outputs given that it will be the basic document for the replicability of PROTIERRAS – it was observed that it is still incomplete.,19
negative,"As a result of this, the sustainability of the project benefits and, in particular the replicability of the model, was considered the weakest aspect of the project, given that 3 of 4 elements need to be strengthened to replicate the model. ",20
positive,"In terms of the efficiency of the project, it is worth pointing out that FAO made the most of the opportunity to act as the executing agency of an environmental sector project in Mexico, which opened the door to future collaborations with this sector, and to have a new source of financing such as GEF.",21
positive,"In addition, taking into account that the project in itself had a low budget and that only 61 percent of the co-financing materialised, it is considered that the resources were used efficiently, and the high replicability of SLM practices is noteworthy. ",22
negative," However, it was found that there were substantial limitations in terms of the identification, management and mitigation of risks by the PCU and the other project monitoring and consultation bodies.",23
negative,At the moment there is no clear trend regarding the effect of SLM practices on land degradation in the reference sites.,24
positive,"However, some physical changes have been registered that could possibly lead to a reversal of the damage, if the SLM practices continue to be rigorously replicated.",25
positive,"The work of the PCU and of the LTAs is noteworthy, in terms of involving the producers, promoters and local authorities in the project, as well as the research centres and other international and private bodies.",26
negative,"However, it was not possible to fully involve the state authorities.",27
positive,The project generated new knowledge about successful SLM practices that were systematised and shared by means of the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) database.,28
negative,"As regards the topic of gender and vulnerable groups, the project did not have the resources or a strategy that would effectively address the inclusion of gender and equality in the project activities, and as a result, young people and women participated in the project to a limited extent.",29
positive,"The project and, in particular the Land  Management Model, represents an alternative that converges the multi-sectoral policies of  the three levels of government.",30
positive,"It does this by means of a watershed approach and by  reversing land degradation to maximise its effectiveness, while empowering local  stakeholders – who act as catalysers and promoters of the model – to make decisions and  contribute in an informed manner to the sustainable management of their land. ",31
negative,"The way in which the project objective was formulated led to the  understanding that – in accordance with the interviews performed and the Mid-Term  x Evaluation – the project would manage to reduce land degradation, and as such the project  was classified as ambitious, considering its duration.",32
negative,"The project was therefore dismissed by  several interviewees, including one of the new federal authorities that stated that it was not  realistic in its scope.",33
negative,"In addition, initiatives were generated in order to have a baseline and to  measure the impact of the implemented SLM practices on land degradation, which was not  included in the PRODOC. ",34
positive,The project managed to systematise the Land Management  Model and provide more detail in its conceptualisation by defining processes and some of  the parts that were not included in the project design. ,35
positive,"ts four main elements were  implemented: governance, land management, production and conservation, as well as  knowledge management.",36
negative,"However, there was not enough time to fine-tune its  conceptualisation and consolidation.",37
negative,"The capacities of the Land Management Committee  members, which constitute the key part of the governance element have to be strengthened  just like the conceptualisation of the committees, as these are viewed as vulnerable.",38
negative,"Land  management, production and conservation elements must be strengthened in technical  terms, as it was understood that the core part of the project was governance.",39
positive,"The knowledge  management element was the most effective, due to the SLM training being highly effective.",40
negative,"In this regard, it was not possible to measure the effectiveness of the model as a whole, given  that it is still incomplete.",41
negative,In addition it is impossible to measure tangible changes in decreased  land degradation because of the model's short implementation period.,42
negative,"The change in government and in priorities of the Federal  Government led to some of the risks identified in the PRODOC arising, and these were not  handled and addressed effectively and in a timely manner, which affected the effectiveness,  co-financing and sustainability of the project. ",43
negative,he stakeholders' involvement in the  project was not entirely effective. ,44
positive,"On the one hand, the PCU and the LTAs competently  involved the producers, promoters and local authorities in the project, as well as the research  centres and other international and private bodies, the participation of which was not set  forth in the project initially. ",45
negative,"On the other hand, it was not possible to fully involve the state  authorities, and as such its policies and investments did not contribute satisfactorily to the  topic. ",46
negative,"The measurement of some soil parameters in an  uncoordinated manner not included in the PRODOC, did not provide a clear trend regarding  the effect of the SLM practices on the sampled demonstration reference sites (DRS), as  expected.",47
positive,"However, some physical changes were recorded in the soil that could lead to  decreased degradation in the long term, if the practices continue to be replicated rigorously. ",48
negative,"The sustainability of the benefits of the project and,  particularly of the Land Management Model, is the weakest aspect of the project, as the  model is incomplete, the project does not have an exit strategy, and lacks a strategy that  enables the continuity of the implementation of SLM practices to ensure the project's  contribution to decreased land degradation.",49
negative,"The project did not have earmarked resources or a  strategy that would effectively address the inclusion of gender and equality in the activities,  and as a result, young people and women participated in the project to a limited extent. ",50
negative,"The project generated and contributed to the  production of new knowledge regarding SLM practices, some of which were systematised  and shared by means of the WOCAT global database. ",51

neutral,The  project was funded by the Government of the Netherlands and implemented by  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO - Yemen) in  collaboration with the Ministry of Water and the Environment and the Ministry of  Agriculture and Irrigation.,75
neutral," It was designed to establish sustainable management of  local water resources and improve rural livelihoods through integrated water  resources management (IWRM), improving cropping systems, raising the  productivity per unit area and improving the income of farmers in the basin area. ",76
neutral,"The main purpose of the evaluation was to provide accountability to the donor and  partners by assessing FAO’s contribution to the objective of the project, i.e.  sustainable crop production systems based on reduced groundwater extraction in  the Sana’a basin to help increase food security.",77
neutral,"The evaluation proposed lessons  from implementation processes that could inform future decisions by the  Governments of Yemen and the Netherlands, and FAO regarding formulation of  projects or follow-up interventions. ",78
negative,The evaluation was limited by a lack of project monitoring data collected regularly  during the project. ,79
negative,"This was particularly noticeable concerning data and  information on the extent of adoption of climate-smart crop varieties, the extent  that farmers reverted back to rainfed farming (and thus, these interventions’  contribution to reduced groundwater abstraction), and the overall project impact  on livelihoods.",80
neutral,"Security in Yemen was an impediment and the mission was unable  to visit Yemen, and so, was dependent on the national consultant for collection of  primary data from beneficiaries.",81
neutral,"In addition to primary data collection conducted  by the national consultant, representatives from the three project implementing  partners and the Chief Technical Adviser discussed project results with the  evaluation team at the FAO Regional Office in Cairo",82
neutral,"Is this project relevant in meeting the needs of the beneficiaries and does it  contribute to implementation of the national development strategy, and fulfilment of the objectives of the FAO country programme? ",83
positive,"By promoting modern irrigation systems and improved, climate-smart cropping  practices SBP remained relevant to the many farmers seeking alternatives to their  current cropping systems based on accessing increasingly expensive groundwater. ",84
positive,SBP established water user associations (WUA) and progressed the Government’s  policy for creation of an IWRM governance structure as a means to decentralize  water regulation and support local development.,85
positive,The project was relevant to FAO’s  country programme and the objectives of the Government of the Netherlands in  Yemen aimed at sustainable groundwater usage and resilient livelihoods. ,86
positive,The  project also supported the FAO-managed Regional Initiative on Water Scarcity in  Near East and North Africa. ,87
neutral,What were the intended and unintended results achieved by the concluded  project?,88
neutral,To what extent did the project achieve its intended results? ,89
positive,SBP achieved most of its intended results and provided an effective model for  developing community-level regulation of groundwater abstraction and livelihood  development. ,90
positive,The project met its objectives by focusing on the cultivation of crops  that were more appropriate to the evolving environmental and climatic conditions  in the Sana’a basin and promoted the adoption of modern irrigation systems.,91
neutral,What factors contributed to achieving or not achieving intended outcomes?,92
positive,"The competence and determination of the project team to operate in a difficult,  often unstable and insecure working environment was the main factor that  contributed to SBP’s achievements.",93
positive,"Collaboration between implementing partners  was effective in producing complementarities, and integrated workplans across  ministries also assisted achievement of results.",94
positive,"During this period,  the team built the capacities of 38 water user associations (WUA) which laid a basis  for building the sub-basin governance structure based on integrated water  resource management (IWRM) principles. ",95
neutral,Are the project’s results sustainable beyond project conclusion? ,96
positive,"Sustainability was integrated throughout the project’s design and implementation,  based on building the capacity of farmers to new irrigation and farming practices,  and creation of active WUAs to be important players in the IWRM governance  structure for the project sub-basins.",97
positive,"SBP also supported WUAs to provide services  to their members such as input supply, marketing and processing farmer produce.",98
neutral,Sustainability of WUAs will depend on the services they can deliver to their  members and the willingness of farmers to pay for these services.,99
neutral,This will also be  a factor in the sustainability of results.,100
positive,"Through participative processes, the project supported beneficiaries  to establish active WUAs that were integral to the government’s policy to decentralise groundwater regulation and progress towards creation of the IWRM governance structure  in each sub-basin. ",101
positive,"SBP expended substantial time and resources in raising awareness  among communities in project sub-basins of impending problems on groundwater  management, and proposed activities to assist farmers ameliorate these issues.",102
positive,The IWRM  governance structure devolves authority to local organisations to regulate water usage and  formulate their longer term development plans. ,103
positive,"Adaptation of modern irrigation systems, protected agriculture  production, introduction of crop varieties more tolerant of low water regimes, and support  to farmers to switch to alternative cash crops helped SBP deliver its objective of improving  farmer productivity, incomes and resilience whilst reducing groundwater abstraction.",104
positive,Women were integrated into  governance structures and decision-making processes. ,105
positive,A competent project team that worked collaboratively and flexibly  in a difficult operational environment was the main factor contributing to effective project  outcomes.,106
positive,"The collaborative effort between two ministries helped deliver project results as  they needed to work adeptly to keep SBP on schedule as much as possible following the  outbreak of war, which caused disruptions to funding and workplans.",107
positive,The project team was  flexible in adapting to these disruptions and alterations to the project design (e.g. the  decision to drop the pilot waste water treatment unit and support farmers to access water  in shallow wells with solar pumps).,108
positive,The IWRM action plan provides a 10-year development strategy with  WUAs integral to implementation of the plan.,109
positive,These WUAs need to be sustainable by  providing valued services to their members in order to collect subscriptions and generate  income from other sources such as their project-supplied greenhouses. ,110
positive,"Sustainability was  integrated throughout the project’s design and implementation, based on building the  capacity of farmers to adopt new irrigation and farming practices.",111
neutral,"Reducing groundwater  abstraction can only be achieved through adoption of a longer term holistic strategy involving all stakeholders in the Sana’a basin in all sectors (social, environment, economic). ",112
neutral,"At the request of the Programme Committee at its 121st session in March 2017, the Office  of Evaluation (OED) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)  undertook an evaluation of the Strategy and Vision for FAO’s Work in Nutrition, six years  after its adoption in 2012. ",137
neutral,"The objectives of the evaluation were to: a) assess progress achieved in the implementation  of the Strategy, especially towards mainstreaming nutrition into FAO’s own work and  thinking; b) examine how the Strategy, the reviewed Strategic Framework and associated  delivery mechanisms have helped FAO to focus and improve its work in nutrition-sensitive  food and agricultural systems; c) provide strategic recommendations for FAO at all levels to  further mainstream nutrition in the work of the Organization and increase the contribution  of food and agricultural systems to nutrition.",138
neutral,The evaluated period was 2012-2018.,139
neutral,"The Nutrition Strategy was meant to directly contribute to the achievement of FAO’s  Strategic Objective (SO) 1 “eradicate hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition”, and its  evaluation was coordinated with the evaluation of Strategic Objective 1 conducted in 2017- 2018.

neutral,The policy environment has changed considerably since the Strategy was developed.,141
neutral,"Driven  by the rapid increase of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in countries associated with the  double/triple burden of malnutrition, there is an increasing recognition among Member  States that effective strategies to address malnutrition must go beyond nutrition-specific  interventions and include modifying food environments, particularly the most obesogenic  one.",142
neutral,"This message was re-enforced by the Second International Conference on Nutrition  (ICN2) organized jointly by FAO and the World Health Organizations (WHO) in November  2014, and in September 2015 the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs), at least eight of which are strongly linked to nutrition.",143
neutral,"Many new actors and initiatives have entered the nutrition ‘landscape’ during the last few  years, such as the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, the REACH partnership, Nutrition  for Growth (N4G), the Global Nutrition Report (GNR) and the Global Panel on Agriculture  and Food Systems for Nutrition.",144
neutral,Multiple private initiatives also emerged.,145
neutral,"The Committee on  World Food Security (CFS) and the United Nations System Standing Committee on Nutrition  (UNSCN) were reformed, with the UNSCN Secretariat moving back from Geneva to Rome in  2016. ",146
neutral,"In FAO, nutrition was also increasingly being addressed in FAO Council and FAO  Conferences, as well as FAO technical and high-level committees on, for example,  Agriculture, Fisheries, Forestry and Commodities Problems, as well as in the CFS. ",147
positive,The evaluation concludes that the Strategy and Vision for FAO’s Work in Nutrition  strengthened FAO’s commitment to this hitherto neglected part of its mandate.,148
neutral,So far these  challenges have predominantly been approached through direct nutrition interventions  mainly implemented in the health sector; yet improving diets through better agriculture and  food systems (so-called food-based approaches) potentially offers more sustainable  solutions to all forms of malnutrition.,149
neutral,"In practice, a number of factors have detracted from the Strategy’s relevance as a guiding  framework.",150
neutral,"The reviewed Strategic Framework, endorsed in 2013, brought a new approach  to programming and budgeting.",151
neutral,"Five Strategic Programmes were designed in 2014, and  Strategic Programme teams set-up in 2015.",152
neutral,"Nutrition was reflected in the reviewed Strategic  Framework initially as a part of Strategic Objective 1 on the eradication of hunger, food  insecurity and malnutrition, and since January 2016, as a cross-cutting theme mainstreamed  in the work of all Strategic Objectives and described in organizational Outcome 6.5.",153
positive,"The organization of the Second International Conference on Nutrition (November 2014)  jointly with WHO was a major achievement during the evaluated period, leading to  participating governments endorsing the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and its Framework  for Action.",154
positive,"This was followed by strong FAO support to the development of the 2030 Agenda  and informing the tracking of targets for Sustainable Development Goal 2, which enshrines  the objective of “ending all forms of malnutrition”. ",155
neutral,"The proclamation of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016-2025 in April 2016 built upon this, with the aim to  “achieve Global Nutrition and diet-related NCD targets by 2025 and contributing to the  realization of the SDGs by 2030”. ",156
positive,"These developments resulted in FAO broadening the scope of its attention to overweight  and obesity, in addition to undernutrition, which was the primary focus of the Nutrition  Strategy. ",157
negative,"This change in FAO’s focus, officially acted in the Medium Term Plan 2018-21, has  clearly strengthened the relevance of FAO’s nutrition work in high-income and upper  middle-income countries, but it also means that the Nutrition Strategy is now partly obsolete,  in stating that “undernutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies, should remain FAO’s  primary focus.” ",158
negative,"Critically, the Strategy failed to address operational issues in sufficient depth and lacked an  accountability framework with agreed upon indicators and reporting processes, which would  have periodically reminded the Organization of the Strategy, as was the case with the  “minimum standards” of the FAO Policy on Gender Equality that was developed during the  same period. ",159
negative,"This certainly reduced the visibility, viability and authority of the Nutrition  Strategy as a guiding document within FAO. ",160
negative,"As a result, the Strategy came to be “crowded  out”, superseded as a guiding tool by more recent documents as explained above. ",161
neutral,"The FAO organizational set-up for nutrition was restructured twice during the evaluation  period, in 2013 and 2016. ",162
neutral,"In 2013, the former Nutrition and Consumer Protection division  (AGN) under the Agriculture Department separated from the Codex and food safety group  and moved to the Economic and Social Development Department (ES).",163
neutral,"In 2016, the Nutrition  Division merged with the agribusiness specialists, food technologists and food value chains  professionals from the ex-AGS division and became the Nutrition and Food Systems Division  (current ESN).",164
positive,These changes signalled a greater recognition of the importance of nutrition  within the Organization.,165
negative,"However, the synergies that were hoped for between the ex-AGS  staff and the rest of the division have yet to fully materialize.",166
neutral,Nutrition-related work areas in the Programme of Work and Budget (PWB) show a modest  increased allocation of assessed contributions for nutrition over the evaluation period.,167
negative,"However, the core budget allocations for ESN as a percentage of FAO total regular budget  have dropped from 1.5 percent in 2012-2013 to 1.2 percent in 2018-2019. ",168
neutral,"A review of posts  allocations indicates that ESN has currently a comparable level of professional posts (30) as  AGN used to have in 2012-2013 (28), while the number of General Staff posts has been  halved from 18 to 9 over the same period.",169
neutral,"In fact ESN has had a number of vacancies, which it used to  hire human resources on a short-term basis through consultancy contracts.",170
neutral," A significant number of key historical staff have left  FAO/ESN over the evaluated period, either because they retired, joined another organization  or moved to a field position.",171
negative,This phenomenon has qualitatively affected ESN’s technical  capacity in that the departing staff had accumulated substantial institutional knowledge and  memory. ,172
neutral,"In addition to headquarters staff, there are 12 nutrition professionals posted in Regional and  Subregional Offices.",173
neutral,"Many of these professionals cover food safety issues as well as nutrition,  as they were established under AGN when the two functions were in the same technical unit",174
positive,"During the evaluation period, the capacity of Regional and Subregional Offices to backstop  Country Offices in nutrition has been built to a significant extent, and to good effect on the  field programme.",175
neutral,"In the current decentralized model, technical support to Country Offices is  the responsibility of Regional and Subregional Offices. ",176
neutral,"Headquarters units as well as Regional  and Country Offices also frequently hire nutrition consultants, e.g. as part of national or  regional projects funded out of voluntary contributions. ",177
neutral,FAO’s nutrition capacity is now spread across the globe and the expertise and experience of  this team needs to be harnessed in innovative ways. ,178
negative,The report recommends the  development of an organization-wide network for knowledge exchange on nutrition- sensitive approaches.,179
negative,"Current efforts in this direction should be expanded to help teams at headquarters and the different regions learn from each other, including horizontal learning  from region to region.",180
negative,"Despite the increase in the number of nutrition staff in Regional, Subregional and Country  Offices (often funded out of voluntary contributions), most decentralized offices remain  under-equipped, resulting in insufficient attendance by senior FAO staff and representatives in dedicated country-level coordination platforms, and weak resource mobilization capacity  and visibility in nutrition. ",181
negative,"Human resources and skill sets are insufficient both to meet this  growing demand and to cope with the challenges of a relatively new area of work requiring  new skills and practical experience, e.g. in inter-sectoral policy dialogue, planning and  programming, and relations with the private sector.",182
negative,The absence of a corporate resource mobilization instrument on nutrition is a major lacuna  that has slowed the Organization’s ability to address the double/triple burden in a broad and  sustained manner.,183
negative,A nutrition trust fund set-up by FAO after the ICN2 Conference was never  promoted to donors and never accrued to.,184
negative,"As a result, FAO lacks resources to fund what  essentially amounts to a whole new area of work, and ESN has had to absorb an increase in  the scope of its work all the while losing some key staff resources.",185
negative,"The “strong focus on  nutrition across the Organization” recommended by the 2011 nutrition evaluation called for  a vigorous resource mobilization effort, or it would have come at the expense of other areas  of work that Member States would probably consider just as important as nutrition.",186
negative,"Member Countries increasingly associate FAO with nutrition, as evidenced by their requests  and priorities expressed during the 2016 round of Regional Conferences, but FAO does not  always have the capacity to respond to their demands.",187
negative,"The modest build-up of country-level  capacities and support over the recent years has been recognized and appreciated by  Member Nations, stakeholders and partners, but they still expect much more from FAO.",188
negative,"he lack of corporate-wide approach to nutrition extends to monitoring and evaluation,  which is not systematically pursued in FAO nutrition-sensitive programmes. ",189
neutral,"The Strategy was originally developed in response to an earlier evaluation carried out in  2010-2011, which concluded that nutrition was a central but neglected part of the  Organization’s mandate.",190
neutral,"The 2011 evaluation put forward 14 recommendations, whose  degree of implementation the present evaluation attempts to assess.",191
positive,"Those 2011  recommendations about the drafting of the Nutrition Strategy, the mainstreaming of  nutrition into the FAO Strategic Framework and structural changes in the Nutrition Division  were fully implemented.",192
negative,Those related to mainstreaming of nutrition in the field programme  and policy work of the Organization have seen slow progress.,193
negative,"Insufficient progress was noted  on recommendations to raising FAO’s engagement and visibility in nutrition-related  networks, notably at country level.",194
negative,"The general picture is that FAO’s main achievements in  nutrition to date relate to advocacy and sensitization at the global level, more so than to the  actual delivery of tested approaches and capacities in the field. ",195
positive,"Clearly, the Second International Conference on Nutrition convened in Rome from 19 to 21  November 2014 by FAO and WHO was by all account a resounding success. ",196
positive,"The resulting  Rome Declaration on Nutrition and Framework for Action significantly raised food-based  approaches to nutrition in the eyes of the world’s political, strategic and programme leaders. ",197
positive,The Conference also established FAO’s standing in the global playing field for nutrition. ,198
positive,"Following ICN2, external stakeholders have increasingly recognized FAO’s contribution to  tracing the linkages between food systems and nutritional outcomes. ",199
positive,"FAO has further promoted the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016-2025, as well as  supported the development of the 2030 Agenda and informing the tracking of SDG2 targets. ",200
neutral, FAO and WHO were mandated to lead with the  implementation of the Decade and to develop a work programme for the Nutrition Decade  in collaboration with other UN Agencies. ,201
positive,"FAO was also successful in hosting and relaunching  the UNSCN at FAO headquarters, providing mutual benefits and access to a wide range of  food system experts. ",202
positive,"Significant work on governance has taken place in Latin America on school meal  programmes, food systems and obesity prevention, in Asia through the promotion of crop  and diet diversity, and in Africa within the context of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture  Development Programme (CAADP) and the Malabo Declaration, with some promising  effects.",203
positive,FAO has helped to strengthen countries’ capacity for mainstreaming nutrition in their  national agriculture and food security investment plans.,204
negative,"There has also been a wide array of  interesting capacity building projects implemented since the Strategy was promulgated, but  they seem weakly related to the Nutrition Strategy and cannot be directly attributed to it. ",205
negative,Modest progress has been achieved in evidence building at country level. ,206
negative,The Minimum  Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) Indicator has been gaining recognition but has only  been piloted in few countries so far.,207
neutral,FAO’s technical guidance on nutrition-sensitive approaches was assessed in some detail.,208
positive,"  large increase in FAO’s nutrition-related publications is noted over the evaluated period, as  well as an effort to translate more publications into various languages and to develop more  integrated packages of publications targeted at different audiences.",209
negative,"Nonetheless, the food systems approach is a wider concept than nutrition-sensitive  agriculture, and still requires a clearer articulation.",210
positive,This sequence of achievements at global  level was followed by the International Symposium on Sustainable Food Systems for Healthy  Diets and Improved Nutrition in 2016 and subsequent five similar regional symposiums held  during 2017 to promote food-based approaches to addressing malnutrition and advocate  for a stronger integration of nutrition in agriculture.,211
positive,"The symposiums both at global and  regional levels brought together the resources of different levels of the Organization, with  excellent collaboration between ESN, Regional Offices and the Office for Corporate  Communication (OCC), to help operationalize the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition.",212
negative,"The extent to which nutrition was mainstreamed in the five Strategic Programmes, the  regional initiatives, country programmes and the work of other technical units was found to  vary a great deal.",213
negative,ESN’s collaboration with other FAO units often appears ad hoc and often  insufficient to promote systematic nutrition mainstreaming. ,214
negative,"The corporate approach to  mainstreaming was formalized only recently, through the publication in September 2018 of  the “Pillars of action and institutional arrangements” document.",215
negative,"Available guidance for  project formulation and to mainstream nutrition in the Country Programming Framework  (CPF) cycle is brief and well-conceived, but the country office backstopping systems put in  place by the other two Rome-based agencies (International Fund for Agricultural  Development, IFAD and World Food Programme, WFP) are far more ambitious and  comprehensive.",216
positive,"Strong partnerships were promoted and are coming out of the ICN2 International  Conference and under the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition, particularly with WHO. ",217
positive,"Links  have been tied with the academia for analytical work, or to help African universities develop  their own nutrition courses (Education for Effective Nutrition in Action, ENACT/Éducation  Nutritionnelle en Afrique Francophone, ENAF curriculum)",218
positive,Regional economic communities and groups as well as regional parliamentary forums were  found useful entry points for policy support and advocacy.,219

positive,"The project was designed in consultation with the  relevant departments of MAF to address their specific information and capacity development  needs for the establishment of an information system able to provide reliable, timely and  updated food security information to decision makers.",272
negative,"However, the capacity development  programme was not designed taking into account the initial skills and knowledge of the MAF  staff, leading to a level of the training which was often too advanced.",273
positive,"The institutional set-up of the project was well conceived, as it promoted the ownership  of NIEWS by MAF.",274
negative,"The project was positively influenced by two major institutional MAF reforms  (e.g. upgrading of the Food Security Unit), but there were also some drawbacks, such as the  reallocation of well-trained staff.",275
positive,The project was efficiently managed by the project team and  received adequate technical backstopping from FAO. ,276
negative,It produced good annual progress reports  but did not establish a proper M&E system.,277
neutral,What has the project achieved vis-à-vis its planned objectives?,278
neutral,The project has effectively contributed to the establishment and functioning of NIEWS  as the national information system that provides information on food security from the villages  to the national level. ,279
negative,"Although the information collected is relevant, constraints have been  identified in the consistency due to frequent disruptions of the extension workers in collecting  local data. ",280

",287
negative,Gender was scarcely considered in the project design or during the project  implementation.,288
negative,"Although a national household food and nutrition security survey was initially  planned with gender-disaggregated data, this activity was cancelled.",289
negative,"In addition, women’s  participation in capacity development activities was quite low, which was partially justified by  the higher number of men in the MAF staff.",290

positive,"The setting up of the National Council for Food Security, Sovereignty and Nutrition in  Timor-Leste (KONSSANTIL) was a tangible result of the work done by the project in networking  and liaising with government institutions, development partners and NGOs, at national and  district level.",293
positive,"It is worth mentioning the effective collaboration with GIZ, Instituto Camões and  the Australian Seeds of Life project, which paved the way to reinforce the technical support  provided to the Agricultural Land Use Geographic Information Systems (ALGIS) on the  rehabilitation of the weather stations and acquisition of real-time data.",294
negative,"Sustainability was partially constrained by the lack of a comprehensive exit strategy,  especially in the handover of responsibilities and tasks to MAF for the preparation of the NIEWS  bulletins and reports.",295
positive,"Despite these limitations, the Government’s ownership and engagement  may result in the continuation of the system.",296
positive,"The political willingness and financial viability  should contribute to the strengthening of the NIEWS system, which is of utmost importance to  generate relevant and timely information on food security and nutrition at national and district  level.",297

negative,The system has some limitations and great potential for improvement.,299
positive,"Despite its limitations,  the information provided by NIEWS has already influenced decision-making at a policy level.",300
positive,Conclusion 2. The strong training component of the project has enabled the start-up and  smooth implementation of NIEWS.,301
negative,"However, insufficient financial resources and  inadequate institutional decisions could jeopardize the system regardless of the positive  signs for sustainability.",302
positive,"Conclusion 3. KONSSANTIL, as the national forum to take coordinated actions in relation to  food and nutrition security matters, has been crucial for the establishment of NIEWS. ",303
neutral,"The Arab region has witnessed several armed conflicts and population displacement  in recent years, which is believed to have brought a new wave of child labor (CL). ",313
neutral,"In  Jordan and Lebanon, the recent years have shown an increase in child labor not only  among Syrian refugees, but also within the host communities.",314
neutral,"or this reason, a  comprehensive evaluation of the interventions in the region that fight child labor is  necessary.",315

neutral,The interview calls with Syria took place during the week of  May 7th ,321
neutral,"The purpose of this evaluation is to assess both the extent to which each project  achieved its objectives, with eventual unexpected positive and negative results, and  the relevance and effectiveness of ILO’s portfolio and strategy on combating child  labor, specifically in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. ",322
neutral,Scope of the Evaluation: The evaluation of each of the projects aims to identify the lessons learnt and good  practices for accountability and learning purposes.,323
neutral,"It assesses the emerging impact of  the interventions on child labour in each country and the region as a whole  considering strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and challenges that have  affected the achievement of each project objective.",324
neutral,The evaluation will also develop  recommendations for the future regional direction on child labour.,325
neutral,"The strategic assessment of ILO’s portfolio and strategy on compacting child labour in  Jordan, Lebanon and Syria considers the relevance of the interventions in all three  countries to status of child labour and defines main gaps. ",326
neutral,"This element of the  assessment also considers the different intervention models, of each of the projects  listed above, and define the impact of these models and their applicability in other  countries in the region. ",327
neutral,Aspects of regional complementarity and integration among  different interventions was also assessed and analyzed.,328
neutral,The following methods were employed in the evaluation:  1. Documentation review (of documents provided by ILO and identified by the  team itself). ,329
neutral,Stakeholder consultations and beneficiary/community group interviews 3. Direct observation  4. Contribution Analysisto independently assess the development effectiveness.  The main type of interview was the Key Informant Interviews (KIIs).,330
neutral,"For all projects, there was an urgent need for effective M&E practices, robust  quantitative and qualitative indicators, and rigorous impact evaluation, supplemented  with relevant follow-up and pre-and post-training tests to evaluate the actual impact  of trainings on individuals’ knowledge and capacities.",331
neutral,Follow-up should be conducted  preferably by an independent or external evaluator. ,332
negative,"Since there was no detailed eligibility criteria list to select beneficiaries, the validity  of results is impaired by the fact that unobservable might have driven people’s  participation.",333
negative,"If this is true, the project is just an acceleration of outcomes that  participants would have achieved anyway.",334
positive,"The implementation of a holistic approach will develop systemic change in order to  address child labor by combining direct services with advocacy, awareness raising and  capacity building ",335
positive,"Almost all the project outputs were delivered in a satisfactory way, so, all the three  projects have been rated as highly effective in achieving the stated outputs and  outcomes. ",336
negative,"One of the common weaknesses amongst the three projects was the limited time  frame, which prevent from the development of a fully comprehensive model for child  labor intervention, and budgets, which prevented the development of education,  protection and livelihood projects that effectively address the needs of the children  and their families. ",337
positive,The ILO projects in Jordan and Lebanon have also been highly  effective in establishing solid relationships with the different national stakeholders.,338
negative,"Due to lack of sufficient data collection, interventions have fallen victim to the ‘snake  biting its own tail’ logic: NGO’s and International Organizations, due to time and  9 budget constraint, cannot conduct effective data collection and this prevent them  from correctly measuring impact and, therefore, conducting better interventions.",339
neutral,An important measurement of impact of interventions is through behavioral and  attitudinal change.,340
positive,"For example, following interventions in Lebanon, the internal  security forces and general security forces adopted a more humanistic approach  towards children, which went from viewing them as criminals to viewing them as  children that required protection.",341
positive,This was achieved both through the designated  impact of the interventions as well as through informal discussions with key  stakeholders such as the GS. ,342
positive,One of the most concrete outcomes achieved has been a widespread awareness amongst the general public that they are all agents of change and have a role to play  in the fight against child labor. ,343
positive,The ability of the projects to progress towards their intended impact was highly  dependent on the effective engagement of all relevant stakeholders in addressing  Child labor.,344
positive,All three projects focused on engaging stakeholders on multiple levels. ,345
positive,"Both in the Canadian-funded project in Jordan project and in the RDPP project in  Jordan, the ILO procedures for project planning, monitoring, reporting and evaluation  for technical cooperation projects were used efficiently throughout the project cycle. ",346
positive,"In the first project, reporting to donors was in accordance with the agreed reporting  schedule, and also regular field mission by the National Program Manager allowed  monitoring and implementation of eventual corrective actions.",347
negative,"Finally, despite the  presence of a pre-project database for the educational project implemented through  the project, the ILO did not have access to it. ",348
positive,"In the second project, detailed  monitoring and evaluation processes were implemented within all capacity building  activities. ",349
positive,"Concerning the RDPP project in Lebanon, different stakeholders implemented their  own monitoring and evaluation systems.",350
neutral,"M&E consists of collecting detailed  information on the number trainings and capacity building activities conducted in a  log framework, even if more robust indicators are required to assess effectiveness of  trainings. ",351
positive,"Regarding the Norwegian-funded project in Lebanon project, continuous visits to field  sites to monitor progress partially compensated for the lack of more robust M&E  system.",352
negative,Sustainability of the ILO’s interventions in Lebanon and Jordan has been difficult to  measure due to the lack of baseline surveys and robust indicators. ,353
negative,"To avoid rebound affect, follow-up activities should be complementary to ensure the  economic empowerment of families and the successful reintegration of children into  their communities.",354
positive,"The OSH and CL manuals developed through the RDPP project in Jordan ensured the  successful implementation not only at the policy level, but also addressing child labor  on the ground.",355
negative,"In order to implement impactful interventions, policy interventions and direct  interventions should be interlinked.",356
negative,"Stand-alone interventions achieve only a  minimal impact, and if they are not linked to a system, they fail to achieve sustainable  results.",357
negative,"Alternatively, interventions focusing solely on policy may lack impact on direct  action on the ground.",358
negative,"It is important to ensure that mechanisms are put in place to,  for example, ensure the livelihoods of families of children withdrawn from child  labor. ",359
negative,"Additionally, a formal strategy to drive attitudinal and behavioral change  amongst parents of child laborers is essential in eradicating child labor practices.",360
negative,"A comprehensive platform should be developed incorporating the monitoring and  evaluation of the different NGOs addressing child labor, in order to help them share  experiences, best practices, data collection tools and information.",361
negative,Provide a platform  for discussion of what is working and what needs improvement amongst key  stakeholders is essential for long-term success.,362
negative,"This should include continuous  dialogue on different aspects of the project amongst donors, development partners,  technical specialists, and social workers etc. to ensure successful implementation. ",363
negative,"Although this is currently happening under the Child Labor  Monitoring and Referral Systems, a centralized platform, which unifies all relevant  information, would be critical in consolidating national efforts addressing CL. ",365
negative,"For instance, it is essential to adopt a long-term outlook with respect to the Syrian  refugee crisis and its wider economic and social implications on child labor. ",366
neutral,"Beyond  CL interventions, support systems need to be planned and implemented once the  refugee children reach the age of 18.",367
negative,It is necessary for the ILO to begin long-term  planning in order to address the future impact of the Syrian refugee crisis.,368
neutral,The ILO can  take a leading role in addressing the long-term planning for the Syrian refugee crisis  in the region.,369
negative,"For the Canadian-funded project in  Jordan project, the commitment of withdrawn children from intervention  projects was limited in some cases as schools were far from residential areas.",380
negative,Budgetary allocations should have taken into account the transportation costs  to ensure that beneficiaries had access to the project as well as alternative  sources of income for vulnerable families.,381
negative,The ability to be flexible is essential  in developing impactful interventions.,382
positive,"Although the RDPP had a more limited  budget in comparison to the Norwegian-funded project in Lebanon, its ability  12 to adapt to changes that arose during the course of operations contributed to  its success.",383
neutral,The ability to adjust operations is particularly important in light of  rapidly changing political and social environments.,384
neutral,"One of the important  lessons learned from the RDPP project, was that when working on multi- regional interventions, countries should work very closely to exploit any  synergies in operations as well as challenges faced at the regional level.",385
negative,"Whilst  capacity building is important, upstream interventions (as awareness  campaigns and trainings) should not be the only focus.",387
negative,It is not efficient to rely  solely upon spillover effects from upstream to downstream.,388
negative,"Additionally,  sustainable elimination of child labor can only be achieved through the  involvement of families and the local community.",389
negative,The participation of these  actors should be essential components in Child Labor withdrawal  interventions.,390
negative,"Moreover, guidance and support regarding direct interventions  should be closely linked to capacity building efforts of the ILO.",391
negative,"Lack of  integration between upstream and downstream interventions is impeding to  correctly anticipate unbalances in the delivery of services: for instance, in  Lebanon, too much attention is paid to Syrians in child labor efforts and not  enough on Lebanese children. ",392
negative,"Interventions should be careful to ensure  equitable impact, in order to protect the most vulnerable children and  families, whilst preventing and societal divisions arising. ",393
positive,"Conducting regional trainings and knowledge sharing activities through active  communication activities is a useful strategy that emerged from the RDPP  project, such as the SCREAM training rolled out through GAM to the Children’s  podium in Jordan.",394
positive," It allows for the exploitation of cultural and linguistic similarities, whilst establishing a set of best practices.",395
positive,"For RDPP trainings  conducted in Egypt, trainees learned the best practices and employed them in  their own country strategies.",396
positive,A strategic communication project aimed at  attitude and behavioral change is essential for child labor interventions in  achieving long-term impact.,397
positive,"For example, the RDPP project adopted a multi- pronged approach, which involved traditional and social media, local leaders  and champions.",398
positive,"In both Jordan and Lebanon, the project received strong  media coverage, raising awareness amongst the general public on the dangers  and risks of child labor.",399
negative,The measurement of the effect of media coverage on  the attitudes of the general public would have to be measured to be able to  fully evaluate the effect of the intervention.,400
neutral,"The development of a formalized agreement can provide an effective solution  for child labor as it provides a reliable source of income for families, conditional  on withdrawing their children from work. ",401
positive,This was demonstrated by the  agreement with the Farmers’ Union in Lebanon.,402
neutral,"The Global Research on Child Labour Measurement and Policy Development Project (MAP) is a  $7 million USD initiative funded by the US Department of Labor (USDOL) and implemented by  ILO under ILO's Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work Branch (FUNDAMENTALS), with the  collaboration of Understanding Children’s Work (UCW) based in Rome.",403
neutral,The project targets 10  countries and aims to build the capacities of the National Statistics Offices (NSOs) to collect and  analyze statistics on child labour; promote the regular data collection on indicators used to  measure child labour; and improve information about existing policy and programmatic  frameworks to combat child labour at the national or sector level.,404

neutral,"Limitations included a short time period between the 2018 assessment  of project planned outcomes and the final evaluation, evaluation fatigue from stakeholders  solicited several times for interviews and timing of the field visits corresponding to the holiday  period for many ILO country staff and country stakeholders.",414
positive,"The project is judged highly relevant by all stakeholders as it fills a gap for actualized data and  provides current, accurate and credible information on youth activities, child labour and  hazardous child labour, thus increasing the visibility of child labour issues.",415
positive,"The project has also  familiarized stakeholders with clear, up-to-date definitions of child labour and hazardous child  labour. ",416
neutral,"The MAP was an ambitious project (initially planned for four years and extended to five years)  that required country-specific approaches, since not all NSOs had the same technical capacities  to conduct surveys and to complete the survey process.",417
positive,"Each country’s ownership of the NCLS  process was facilitated by a building block approach, a strong focus on capacity building, a  “learning by doing” approach paired with on-going and adapted technical support, timely  communications and the provision of standardized tools judged appropriate by all the  stakeholders interviewed.",418
neutral,Ten countries produced child labour surveys and NCLS reports have been published and publicly  available. ,419
positive,NSO capacities have been raised significantly to a point where the  majority of NSOs consider having acquired enough technical skills and knowledge to produce  child labour statistics meeting international standards. ,420

neutral,"As for the two qualitative reports on children  living in Roma communities for Serbia and Azerbaijan, they were not completed.",423
negative,Most project  stakeholders did not see the direct link between the NCLS and the policy appraisal process.,424
negative,A  comprehensive theory of change (ToC) at the planning stage of the project could have provided  a clear picture for all stakeholders of the short- and medium-term changes required to reach all  project objectives.,425
neutral,Understanding Children’s Work (UCW) uploaded eight child labour datasets to the UCW site.,426
neutral,Tunisia previously indicated that its dataset would not be made public due to the legislation. ,427
neutral,The  dataset for Jamaica is not yet available.,428
positive,"Overall, the project was cost-efficient in its implementation and the project management made  effective use of funds, given the financial and human resources allocated for the full  implementation of the project. ",429
positive,The final evaluation has identified several success factors supporting the potential impact of the  MAP.,430
positive,"NCLS information has fed into the National Action Plans or National Child Strategies  (Malawi, Armenia, Tanzania, Paraguay, El Salvador, and Tunisia), Child Policy review (Jamaica)  and enactment of laws, bills and regulations (Paraguay in domestic work and night work, Malawi  through community by-laws).",431
positive,"Moreover, the tools and methodologies demonstrate a solid  potential to contribute to the improvement other surveys, particularly labour force surveys and  statistics related to children’s rights.",432
positive,"Considerations about project timeline, TOC, and a comprehensive exit/phase-out  strategy and bringing the gap between NCLS report, dissemination and policy appraisals ought  to be considered as factors contributing to the sustainability of the MAP or similar interventions.",433
positive," Lessons learned include the importance of developing a clearly articulated Theory of Change  during the planning stage of the project; ensuring that key messages related to information from  national child labour surveys are transmitted to all levels within a country, which favours a wider  dissemination strategy of survey findings; the sharing of tasks among all partners is key to the  finalization of the national child labour survey reports; and increased dialogue with governments  and social partners can ensure the successful completion of activities.",434
positive,"Best practices include  Tunisia’s decision to publish a NCLS summary report communicating only key findings, in  response to a request for information from the government, which gave the NSO more time to  conduct an in-depth analysis of CL issues and produce a complete report later in the project.",435
positive,The  level of flexibility demonstrated by ILO and the management team to adapt interventions (i.e.  policy appraisal) to better meet country-level needs and interests is another best practice that  supports project implementation and completion.,436
neutral,"This project, funded through a Programme Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the ILO and the  Government of Norway, was implemented over a period of 20 months in five African countries – Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia – and focused on their skills development  systems and programmes.",462

positive,"The NSA implementing partners, in collaboration with ministries of health, conducted ten  operational research projects on issues such as supervision systems for CHWs, appropriate  training and data collection tools, or the use of mHealth for improving quality of care and data  collection. ",941
positive,Some of these research projects were completed at the time of data collection for the  evaluation and had already resulted in programme improvements.,942
negative,"The final results of most,  however, had not yet been disseminated or discussed.",943
negative,Other research results and lessons drawn  at the level of the RAcE Initiative were also still being prepared for documentation.,944
negative,"Data collected  by the end of February 2018 did not yet allow a full assessment of the contribution of the RAcE  Initiative to new knowledge about iCCM at global, regional and national levels. ",945
positive,Work in this area  by the GMP is on-going and is expected to generate results that will likely contribute to more and  better guidance for national policy and regulatory frameworks on iCCM. ,946
neutral,The national policy and regulatory environment for iCCM is a major determinant of the  sustainability of services.,947
positive,"The RAcE programmes contributed extensively to this dimension, for  instance by supporting the inclusion of iCCM in national health strategies.",948
neutral,"While much was  achieved in this area, including the creation of iCCM budget lines in national or sub-national  health budgets, iCCM services in the five programme countries continue to be predominately  funded by international development partners.",949
negative,This created critical situations of medicine stock-outs and reductions of CHW  supervision as the RAcE programmes were nearing their end.,951
positive,"To avoid iCCM service gaps in RAcE  ix programme areas, a process of sustainability planning was initiated in 2016.",952
neutral,It was still on-going  in some countries at the time of the evaluation.,953
negative,"While the structured process was highly  appreciated by all key informants at country level, most were of the opinion that starting it in the  last programme year was too late, and that financing gaps could have been avoided if a  sustainability roadmap would have been developed and implemented from the start of the  programme. ",954
neutral,DID THE EVALUATION CORROBORATE THE ESTIMATED CHANGES IN ICCM TREATMENT  COVERAGE AND CHILD MORTALITY MODELLED BY ICF? ,955
positive,Data collected by the evaluation provide evidence that the RAcE Initiative contributed to  a reduction in child mortality.,956
neutral,This evidence is based on qualitative data collected in focus groups  and interviews. ,957
negative,Reliable health facility data that documented a reduction of admissions of  children with severe life-threatening conditions were only partially available in one programme. ,958
positive,Population surveys conducted after the evaluation may provide further evidence of reduced child  mortality in RAcE programme areas.,959
negative,"The mortality reduction estimated with the aid of the Lives  Saved Tool (LiST) model could, however, not be corroborated. ",960
negative,Reliable input data of baseline  mortality and of specific treatment coverage were not available to generate credible model  outputs.,961
neutral,This is the same finding as in a previous multi-country iCCM evaluation in 2014.,962
neutral,DID THE RACE INITIATIVE CONTRIBUTE TO ACHIEVEMENTS OF GENDER EQUALITY RESULTS?,963
negative,The RAcE Initiative did not live up to its commitments on gender mainstreaming. ,964
negative,The  evaluation found no evidence that a gender analysis was done in any of the programmes nor that  gender mainstreaming was pursued actively.,965
negative,The indicators in the quarterly performance reports  asking for sex-disaggregated data in all programmes except the DRC were consistently ignored. ,966
negative,Differences in access to treatment observed in baseline and end-line surveys were not analysed  for causes.,967
neutral,Low literacy rates of women in rural areas were uniformly cited as the only reason for  difficulties in recruiting female CHWs.,968
negative,"In interviews, however, many other reasons related to  gender relations in communities were mentioned. ",969
negative,No analysis or approaches to address these  issues were explored beyond encouragements for communities to nominate female CHW  candidates.,970
negative,The findings of the overall lack of gender awareness of the RAcE Initiative mirrors the  findings of the literature review which found practically no discussion of gender issues. ,971
neutral,"The evaluation was based on data collected at programme level, but it was not an  evaluation of each country programme.",982
neutral,"While the recommendations of the evaluation are  directed to WHO, there are a number of lessons that can be drawn by partner governments in  xi the RAcE Initiative.",983
positive,The Initiative demonstrated that iCCM is a mature component of a UHC  strategy in countries with populations that live beyond easy reach of primary health care  facilities. ,984
neutral,"In the Alma-Ata Declaration of 1978, the signatory Member States to this seminal document  “express[ed] the need for urgent action by all governments, all health and development workers, and  the world community to protect and promote the health of all the people of the world”.",999
neutral,"n so doing,  they declared their commitment to the broad principles of primary health care: health as a human  right that is the basis for economic and social development as well as world peace; health as not  merely constituting the absence of disease or infirmity; health equity both between and within  countries; and roles and responsibilities of governments for the health of their populations and of the  people to participate in the planning and implementation of their health care.",1000
neutral,"Setting a goal of “the  attainment by all peoples of the world by the year 2000 of a level of health that will permit them to  lead a socially and economically productive life”, Member States placed primary health care at the  centre of this goal and articulated the core elements of primary health care described elsewhere in  this report.

neutral,"Member States underlined the need “to exercise political will, to mobilize [their respective  countries’] resources and to use available external resources rationally”, and for WHO, UNICEF and  other international organizations to support them in their efforts.",1002
neutral,"Although the concept of primary health care has been operationalized in multiple ways over time and  in different contexts, for the purposes of this review, the comprehensive definition articulated by  WHO and UNICEF in their shared vision document for primary health care provides the lens through  which global progress, achievements and success stories, best practices and key challenges were  identified in this review.",1003
neutral,"This definition describes primary health care as: a whole-of-society approach to health that aims to ensure the highest possible level of health  and well-being and their equitable distribution by focusing on people’s needs and preferences  (as individuals, families, and communities) as early as possible along the continuum from health  promotion and disease prevention to treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care, and as close  as feasible to people’s everyday environment.",1004
neutral,"Primary health care is clearly differentiated from the closely-related term “primary care”, which is the  organization of essential health services principally at the first level of care. ",1005
neutral,"As such, primary care is  one important element of primary health care, but is also clearly distinguished from the much broader  concept of primary health care as an overall approach to health. ",1006
neutral,"On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Alma-Ata Declaration, participants at the Global  Conference on Primary Health Care held in Astana, Kazakhstan on 25 and 26 October 2018 issued the  Astana Declaration “reaffirming the commitments expressed in the ambitious and visionary  Declaration of Alma-Ata of 1978 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in pursuit of  Health for All”.3",1007

neutral,"In addition to identifying achievements, challenges, lessons and best practices associated with  primary health care generally until 2018, the review also aimed to make recommendations on the way  forward in order to accelerate national, regional and global health strategies and plans for universal  health coverage, primary health care and the Sustainable Development Goals.",1011
neutral,"In order to offer this  forward-looking direction, the review incorporated into its retrospective analysis an examination of  whether and how primary health care efforts had helped to achieve universal health coverage and  Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) and  its associated targets. ",1012
neutral,Two practical guideposts helped to frame the review in this regard: • Role of primary health care in achieving universal health coverage.,1013
neutral,"The primary health care vision document set forth by WHO and UNICEF outlines the various pathways through which each of the main components of primary health care (that is, primary care and essential public health functions, multisectoral policy and action, and empowered people and communities) is envisioned as reinforcing universal health coverage in the three main ways in which it is enabled, namely by: (i) promoting financial protection/reducing household expenditure on health, (ii) quality services, medicines and vaccines, and (iii) equitable access. ",1014
neutral,The review explicitly took stock of achievements and challenges along these specific pathways as a means of identifying best practices and lessons for the future. ,1015
neutral,Two more recently published documents reiterate this link.,1016
neutral,"WHO’s recent universal health coverage monitoring report for 2019 frames primary health care as the “programmatic engine for [universal health coverage] in most contexts”6 in a variety of ways: through its emphasis on community empowerment and social accountability, its multisectoral approach that recognizes the connection between health and other sectors, its focus on integrating separate services in a holistic manner, its emphasis on cost-effectiveness by bringing comprehensive health closer to communities and homes and its aim of equity to ensure coverage for all.",1017
neutral,"linkage was reaffirmed by Member States at the high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on universal health coverage on 23 September 2019, referring to primary health care as “the cornerstone of a sustainable health system for universal health coverage and health-related Sustainable Development Goals”.",1018
neutral,The review examined the conceptual intersection between the main features of primary health care/universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals (especially Goal 3) since the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development commits countries to achieving universal health coverage by 2030.,1019
neutral,"Moreover, as referenced  above, the high-level meeting in September 2019 emphasized primary health care as being  “the cornerstone” to achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. ",1020
neutral,The review aimed to assess global progress towards primary health care implementation through two  complementary information sources: a systematic review of existing published data sources and an  assessment of country-level implementation through Member State engagement and inputs obtained  by means of an online survey for all Member States.,1021
neutral, The desk review involved a review of reports  from all six WHO regions and included a review and synthesis of high-level documents and country- level case-study reports.,1022
neutral,An online Member State survey was launched in the six official languages of  the Organization on a secure WHO electronic platform. ,1023
neutral,Ninety-four Member States provided focal  points and a total of 50 responses were received.,1024

neutral,"The review also adhered to WHO cross-cutting  evaluation strategies on gender, equity, vulnerable populations and human rights, and included, to  the extent possible, disaggregated data and analysis.",1026
neutral,"Data from the online survey and the desk review  were cross-checked, verified and validated to ensure accuracy and consistency.",1027
neutral,Key findings from the desk review and online survey are summarized under the four evaluation  questions: (a) What have been the enabling factors and challenges in developing and implementing primary  health care approaches in countries over the past 40 years?,1028
positive,The key enabling factors in developing and implementing primary health care approaches in the past  40 years that were cited in the review are as follows:  i) Political will and good governance.,1029
positive,"Survey respondents highlighted the role played by ministry officials, politicians and other leading figures who are willing and able to advocate, pass legislation and implement health reforms that support primary health care. ",1030
positive,"However, it was also noted that formal institutional arrangements such as ministerial councils set up to oversee primary health care help to ensure that gains are sustained beyond electoral cycles.",1031
neutral,"These include various aspects of the health system such as universal health coverage-related legislation, increased financing and financial risk pooling, equity-promoting initiatives, health information systems and other uses of technology. ",1032
neutral,This broad area includes ensuring community participation and intersectoral engagement. ,1033
neutral,"Examples of such initiatives include those for maternal and child care, nutrition, immunization, care and treatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases and other essential elements of primary health care systems.",1034
neutral,"These include engagement of government with civil society, nongovernmental organizations, community-based organizations and private sector entities. ",1035
neutral,"This includes changes in health care organizational management, in particular, the establishment of family practices and/or multidisciplinary teams and the introduction of nationwide screening or preventive care measures. ",1036
neutral,Many of the key challenges identified in the review represent the inverse of the enabling factors  described above,1037
neutral,Others included the following: i) Human resources for health.,1038
negative,"The health workforce was reported as a key challenge in the online survey and also in the desk review, in particular, the distribution of health workers (urban/rural disparities) within countries, as well as the international recruitment of health care professionals and the phenomenon of brain drain.",1039
negative,"High staff turnover (resulting from attrition), the lack of incentives to encourage health workers to pursue professional development both for career progression and to maintain required skills and qualifications were also noted. ",1040
negative,The challenge of maintaining an adequately skilled workforce is particularly acute in remote and underserviced areas. ,1041
negative,Primary health care often struggles to attract adequate funding in the face of demands from secondary and tertiary care.,1043
negative,"The reduction of public health budgets negatively affects vulnerable groups, as do users’ fees and increases in out-of-pocket expenditures. ",1044
negative,Poor coordination of policies across sectors and gaps in certain primary health care-related policies were cited as a significant challenge.,1045
negative,Survey respondents identified having an unclear policy agenda as a challenge to the development and implementation of primary health care. ,1046
negative,"Poor coordination of policies within government, coupled with poor coordination of policies between the government and other stakeholders, were mentioned as specific examples of these challenges.",1047
negative,Some respondents also mentioned a gap in primary health care-related legislation in their respective countries.,1048
negative,"Even where universal and comprehensive coverage has been or will likely be achieved, timely access to quality health services was cited as a challenge.",1049
negative," The desk review noted chronic shortages of qualified staff, equipment and supplies, coupled with an absence of basic standards in health care delivery or weak enforcement where such standards exist, which further exacerbate inequity of access to quality health care. ",1050
neutral,"Health information is crucial to enabling an understanding of the health needs of the population, for monitoring services and for undertaking evidence-based planning and decision-making in programming. ",1051
negative,"Evidence-based decision-making is often constrained by challenges arising from poor quality of data, limited data availability and underuse of available data. ",1052
negative,The lack of interoperability among country-based information systems results in different entities collecting (and often duplicating) information that cannot be shared among national institutions.,1053
negative,"Such challenges are faced by vulnerable groups such as women, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, rural dwellers, refugees and internally displaced persons, ethnic minorities and other marginalized groups.",1054
neutral,"How have primary health care and related innovations helped to improve health outcomes,  equity, intersectoral collaboration and efficiency? ",1055
positive,"Survey respondents mentioned improved health in their populations as one of the key achievements in their implementation of primary health care, for example, progress in maternal health and child care, a decrease in communicable diseases, a high success rate in immunization coverage and control of vaccine-preventable diseases, and improved life expectancy.",1056
positive,A smaller number of respondents cited the reduction in noncommunicable disease risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use.,1057
positive,"With respect to equity, human rights and the needs of vulnerable groups, policies and strategies have been developed that steer the global health community closer towards the goals set in the Alma-Ata and Astana Declarations, and the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals.",1058
positive,"These gains included equity of geographic access to services (for example, between urban and rural/remote communities) and improved equity across socioeconomic groups in some countries. ",1059
positive,"Devolved decision-making and enhanced accountability to subnational (for example, municipal or regional) levels of governments allowed integration of health and social care, improved coordination of services with secondary care and strengthened preventive activities.",1060
positive,Health reforms in some countries’ decentralized health care systems (from regional to local levels) reoriented primary health care towards families and communities. ,1061
positive,"Through increased education, health promotion and communication, individuals, families and communities learn to take responsibility for their own health. ",1062
positive,Many countries now allow patients to choose their family doctor. ,1063
positive,"Providing services to specific population groups such as refugees, elderly people or people with disabilities facilitates health access and improves health equity. ",1064
positive,Initiatives such as public health insurance schemes and other financing mechanisms addressed socioeconomic disparities and made health care more accessible.,1065
positive,"Other innovations, such as performance-based payment schemes, improved primary health care in some countries, while the use of e-health systems improved networking and information sharing between medical disciplines and enhanced the quality of health care. ",1066
positive,"This area included advances in telecommunications, the Internet, use of electronic medical records and development of e-health applications (telehealth, applications for mobile devices, e-referrals).",1067
positive,"applications and telemedicine have made working in remote areas, where many vulnerable, poor people live, more attractive for the health workforce in many locations.",1068
positive,Technological resources have been used to augment the role of the health workforce and to provide training and education to develop a health workforce with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively manage current and future health challenges. ,1069
neutral,What intersectoral approaches have been implemented for primary health care? ,1070
positive,"With primary health care representing a whole-of-society approach to health, the nature and extent of intersectoral collaboration is an important dimension of progress.",1071
positive," The desk review unveiled a rich pool of intersectoral approaches that have been developed and implemented since 1978, ranging from intersectoral planning and implementation of multisector initiatives in rural community settings to implementation at national level. ",1072
positive,Several survey respondents mentioned adopting Health in All Policies approaches that encouraged government agencies to assess health impacts and take them into consideration in developing policy or legislation.,1073
positive,"There are many examples of collaboration among various ministries (beyond the health ministries), for instance, collaboration between the ministries of health, education and agriculture for food and nutrition programmes in schools.",1074
positive,The health and education sectors also collaborate to ensure that school health programmes include age-appropriate immunization requirements prior to school enrolment.,1075
positive,"Other examples of intersectoral action exist on a wide variety of topics including disaster preparedness and response, environmental health, road safety, water and sanitation, food safety, society-wide pandemic preparedness and measures to tackle noncommunicable diseases. ",1076
neutral,"This can take place between different levels of government (local, state and federal, for instance). ",1077
neutral,This includes collaboration and coordination between the public and private sectors.,1078
neutral,"Several countries are aiming to improve social and health services by merging health sector agencies with those responsible for other social welfare services into a single entity, with a view to ensuring better coordination of funding and delivery.",1079
positive,"Some respondents report that this approach has great potential for strengthening coordination and integration of services, not least of all for particularly vulnerable groups such as older people, people with mental illness and people who abuse alcohol or drugs. ",1080
positive,The desk review showed that governments have also encouraged integrated care partnerships between voluntary and community representatives and service users in collaborative networks to respond innovatively to the needs of local communities. ,1081
neutral,"Intersectoral coordination among health sector entities involves closer working between the public and private sectors, engaging general practitioners, the family medicine system, laboratories, medical equipment and suppliers of medicines, and strengthening referral systems (vertical coordination between primary, secondary and tertiary care). ",1082
neutral,What lessons and innovations from different country and regional technical or development  contexts can be adapted and shared to promote and scale up future efforts in universal health  coverage and primary health care?,1083
neutral,"These are needed for primary health care to succeed, including through financial commitment for funding primary health care.",1084
positive,"Good governance is cited as being the foundation for achievement of primary health care goals, most generally by ensuring that coherent policies and strategies are in place to promote the health and well-being of the population in a people-centred manner. ",1085
positive,Primary health care promotes efficient use of financial resources for health.,1086
positive,The role of primary care in primary health care as a gatekeeping function prevents over-use of specialized care in secondary and tertiary services and reduces costs.,1087
neutral,"The gatekeeping function depends on the quality and training of primary health care staff, as well as on well-tailored policies, functional referral systems and regulatory frameworks, which are essential to reduce health costs for health systems and patients.",1088
negative,"Enhancing accountability and transparency in the use of funds is important for Member States, as is predictable and sufficient funding for primary health care. ",1089
neutral,Health insurance schemes and innovative public-private partnerships can also lead to improvements in health outcomes.,1090
neutral,A well-qualified health workforce is needed for successful primary health care implementation.,1091
neutral,An effective primary health care system needs a skilled health workforce and interdisciplinary teams.,1092
neutral,"Generating a health workforce that is adequate in terms of size and qualifications depends on the quality of health education and training, salary levels and regulatory frameworks.",1093
neutral,Equity of access and care depends on a sufficiently large health workforce that is sufficiently incentivized (financially or otherwise) to work in more remote or underserved populations.,1094
positive,Community participation and engaged users improve access and quality of care. ,1095
neutral,Engaging users of primary health care services  with local policy-makers is important for a successful primary health care system. ,1096
neutral,t is also  important to ensure adequate regulatory frameworks and accountability mechanisms in health  systems. ,1097
negative,Evidence-based actions require improvements in collection and use of data.,1098
neutral,"n the desk review, data- and evidence-driven approaches were noted as key to effective and efficient primary health care implementation. ",1099
neutral,"For governments and other health sector staff to make well-informed decisions, the generation and use of data and evidence are crucial. ",1100
negative,"However, government capacity to collect, analyse and use data is often subject to significant capacity constraints. ",1101
positive,"As Member States noted in their positive overall self-assessment of their respective countries’  progress since the Alma-Ata Declaration, the past 40 years have witnessed a number of significant  achievements in the implementation of primary health care. ",1102
positive,"Many health indicators have continued  to improve in most countries and, on the whole, people are healthier and are living longer today than  40 years ago. ",1103
positive,"Accordingly, numerous Member States focused on the end outcome of improvements  in both the level and equity of health in their populations as one of the foremost achievements over  the past four decades. ",1104
positive,"As the review highlighted, various aspects of primary health care  implementation were considered to have been instrumental in achieving these outcomes, with  particularly significant progress in coverage of basic health care, immunization coverage and the  eradication and control of a number of infectious diseases.",1105
positive,"In many countries, these achievements  have been realized not only in the overall population, but rather also among subsegments of the  population traditionally marginalized or particularly vulnerable for geographic and socioeconomic  reasons; in so doing, these countries have made substantial progress toward the equity aims of  primary health care. ",1106
positive,Underpinning these accomplishments have been policy changes aimed to integrate the principles and  goals of primary health care within countries’ health systems.,1107
positive,"In some countries, these policy changes  have led to targeted and incremental refinements of specific aspects of their existing health systems.",1108
positive,"In other countries, these changes have resulted in more fundamental reform of countries’ health  systems to bring them into line with the principles and goals of primary health care for equitable,  effective, efficient and responsive health care. ",1109
positive,"In numerous countries, these policy actions have  translated into increased expenditure on health systems and specifically on primary health care- centred health systems. ",1110
positive,One of the main elements of these reforms has been the move towards greater intersectoral  collaboration.,1111
positive,"Such intersectoral approaches have encompassed, first and foremost, collaboration  between ministries of health and various other ministries whose work is mutually reinforcing with the  goals of the health sector.",1112
positive," Importantly, they have included other levels of collaboration as well, for  example: strengthened collaboration among the various health professions and disciplines;  collaboration across various sectors of society (including civil society organizations, nongovernmental  organizations and community-based organizations) and more generally between governments and  non-State actors; and collaboration between and among separate levels of government and public  administration (such as health authorities at the national, regional and local levels).",1113
positive,"This whole-of- government, whole-of-society, Health in All Policies approach constitutes an achievement in its own  right for many countries. ",1114
positive,"This review emphasized that implementation of primary health care has not been a formulaic  undertaking, but rather has been accomplished through a wide range of innovations that constitute a  viii subcategory of achievements themselves.",1115
positive,The latter half of the post-Alma-Ata era has witnessed vast  advances in information and communications technology that have revolutionized the delivery of  primary health care. ,1116
positive,Innovations have come in less technology-related ways as well.,1117
positive,"For example,  some have focused on improving service provision or enhancing the management of primary health  care; others have comprised structural and administrative innovations to devolve decision-making to  levels of government closer to the populations they serve; while others have focused on initiatives to  empower communities and individuals themselves to take a more active role in their health.",1118
positive,"A range  of other innovations have centred on strengthening the resourcing of health, in terms of both financial  and human resources. ",1119
negative,"Although vast gains have been made in health outcomes over the past four decades, it is unclear to  what extent these gains can be attributed directly to primary health care implementation. ",1120
negative,"This  information gap is unsurprising, as discussions surrounding the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  Development and Sustainable Development Goals have highlighted the gap in results-level data  globally.",1121
positive,"That said, many Member States nonetheless maintain that implementation of primary health  care has indeed contributed to overall improvement in health outcomes as well as equity. ",1122
negative,"In spite of the significant gains achieved globally in the implementation of primary health care, the  review highlighted that such progress has been uneven both between and within countries, posing  ongoing challenges to achieve equity. ",1123
negative,"Beyond this overarching challenge, the review identified a wide  range of areas that have frustrated efforts to achieve the goals of primary health care. ",1124
negative,"Although there  have been many noteworthy gains in some countries, the area of human resources for health has been  a longstanding issue and remains an outstanding challenge in most countries’ primary health care  implementation efforts. ",1125
negative,"Despite vast  advances in information and communications technology, those advances have not always been  effectively taken up and used at scale to positively impact health and well-being and, in many  countries, data have been of poor quality, limited or non-existent, or available but underutilized.",1127
negative,Another broad category of challenges revolves around the many facets of quality of care.,1128
negative,"At the  broadest level, numerous Member States maintained that low quality of services, long waiting times  and difficulties obtaining medical appointments represented some of their key challenges.",1129
negative,"In those  Member States where primary care practitioners were involved as gatekeepers in order to reduce  inappropriate demands on costly secondary and institutional care, referral processes did not always  function as intended, contributing to fragmented or misdirected care. ",1130
negative,"Elsewhere, especially in  countries affected by conflict, poor health infrastructure is a significant factor that negatively affects  quality of care.",1131
neutral,Numerous Member States indicate that they still face  challenges in generating and sustaining this political will.,1133
neutral," In other countries, political will might be  present, but the policy context is inconducive to undertaking the ambitious changes necessary to  implement primary health care: policy agendas, policy design, policy coherence and governance have  often been inadequate, as has the regulatory framework for primary health care.",1134
neutral,"In some countries,  government engagement with non-State actors has been weak. In others, political instability or  conflict have significantly hampered primary health care implementation efforts.",1135
neutral,The review revealed a wide range of often interrelated factors that help to explain the range of  achievements and challenges encountered over the past four decades.,1136
positive,"Conversely, financial  protection measures are reported as positively affecting primary health care implementation as well  as an achievement in many countries.",1138
positive,Other key factors include: vibrant civil society organizations and  the level of involvement of other non-State actors in a given country; the availability and effective  distribution of skilled human resources for health; the degree of donor-driven intersectoral  coordination; and the extent to which data- and evidence-driven approaches are used to implement  primary health care. ,1139
neutral,"However, the review revealed a much broader set of contextual factors that have affected primary  health care implementation globally. ",1140
neutral,"Rapid globalization of the world economy has significantly  shaped primary health care in a wide range of ways, some of these positive and others less positive. ",1141
neutral,"Broad demographic trends have resulted in older populations living longer lives, but not necessarily  longer and healthier lives, and often without population replacement by economically active younger  cohorts to adequately support increased longevity.",1142
neutral,"Intrastate  conflict, meanwhile, has placed a significant burden on those countries party to such conflicts – as well  as those not party to the conflicts. ",1144
positive,"The Astana Declaration takes a clear, forward-looking view of primary health care implementation,  explicitly anchoring its vision for the future of such implementation in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable  Development and the Sustainable Development Goals.",1145
positive,"More recently, the linkage between primary  health care, universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals was reaffirmed by  Member States at the high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on universal health  coverage on 23 September 2019.",1146
positive,"In the political declaration ensuing from this meeting, primary health  care was considered to be “the cornerstone of a sustainable health system for universal health  coverage and health-related Sustainable Development Goals”.",1147
neutral,The underlying lessons from this  review could thus help inform the way forward. ,1148
neutral,"Despite the wide range of experiences globally over the past 40 years, many of the lessons emanating  from these experiences can be consolidated into a much smaller subset of guideposts moving forward. ",1149
neutral,"Framed as lesson statements, these include the following: • The translation of political will into action is a prerequisite for achieving the principles and objectives of primary health care. ",1150
positive,"In both the Alma-Ata and Astana Declarations, the international community committed itself to action on primary health care.",1151
positive,"As this review suggested, some countries have translated this commitment into a broad range of concrete policy actions, strategies and regulatory frameworks – as well as financial resources that are commensurate with their ambitious commitments",1152
negative,Other countries have seen less progress in translating their commitments into concrete action for various reasons.,1153
negative,"One lesson emerging from this review is that, in order for implementation to be effective in realizing the objectives and principles of primary health care, commitments require political will to be translated into concrete and consistent policy action, and resources. ",1154
neutral,Successful primary health care implementation calls for broad-based partnership. ,1155
negative,"The extent and strength of such  partnerships have varied considerably from one country to the next, however. ",1156
neutral,"Intersectoral collaboration, a core component of primary health care implementation, requires concerted effort.",1157
neutral,"This review underlined that intersectoral collaboration is multifaceted, extending well beyond interministerial collaboration between the health sector and other sectors.",1158

neutral,"In recognition of the complexity of the intergovernmental negotiations required to agree on the FENSA, the intrinsic sensitivity of the topic at hand, the number and diversity of  engagements involved, and the time, effort and resources invested to develop and maintain these  relationships, the evaluation did not assess the FENSA as a framework in itself but rather the  implementation of the FENSA.1 ",1202
neutral,"The evaluation was undertaken in a participatory, utility-focused and rigorous manner: it provides robust evidence from multiple data sources, identifies learning opportunities and  frames practicable recommendations for course correction.",1203

neutral,"In  response to requests by the Independent Expert Oversight Advisory Committee, an  implementation plan was approved on 21 December 2017.",1216
negative,"The use and value of this document  has been limited, however, and it not a sufficiently actionable plan to guide coherent and  systematic implementation of the FENSA due to the 18-month lag time from the resolution’s  adoption to the approval of the draft plan, coupled with the limited communication and use of the  plan as an instrument for implementation. ",1217
negative,The timeframe for WHO to fully implement the FENSA  and operating procedures appears to have been overly optimistic in light of WHO’s capacity and  capability to institute change effectively – a challenge exacerbated by the fact that a phased  approach to implementation had not been included in the adopted resolution despite a  recommendation to this effect having previously been identified in an external audit of the  implications of the FENSA’s implementation conducted in 2016 (i.e. just prior to the resolution’s  adoption). ,1218
negative,"As a result of this  gap, downstream actions to implement the FENSA have been fragmented and not supported by a  coherent communication and information dissemination strategy. ",1219
negative,The absence of effective  communication and information dissemination plans to support the implementation of the  FENSA among audiences internal and external to WHO has compromised roll-out.,1220
negative,Staff and  partner needs have mainly been addressed in a responsive and reactive manner rather than  proactively.,1221
negative,"Where communications activity has taken place, this activity has not kept pace with  changing staff and partner needs in the dynamic FENSA implementing context. ",1222
neutral,"Given the absence of a comprehensive FENSA implementation strategy or plan, activities and outputs were clustered into the following tiers for the purposes of this evaluation to enable  systematic and structured assessment, as well as an exploration of the interconnectedness  between activities and outputs: • Tier 1: Strengthening understanding, ownership and management of the risks and benefits of engagement; • Tier 2: Specializing and applying nuanced application (technical and contextual); • Tier 3: Expert technical advice and institutional memory for standardized procedures. Escalation point for exceptional cases. ",1223
positive,"Despite the lack of an overarching strategy that would establish guideposts for maximally efficient and effective implementation of the FENSA, the evaluation team notes that, as a testament to the considerable efforts of staff, WHO has succeeded in initiating (if not completing)  implementation on all aspects required by resolution WHA69.10.",1224
positive,"Within each of the three tiers, a  number of key outputs were delivered within the two-year implementation timeframe.",1225
positive,This  significant achievement forms a solid foundation for the FENSA’s further implementation. ,1226
negative,"Nonetheless, these actions have been undertaken in an ad hoc, fragmented and unsystematic  manner across the Organization and implementation was not sufficiently resourced. ",1227
negative,"However, more limited progress has been made in other important areas, such as full functionality of the Register of non-State actors through the inclusion of all non-State actors;  coordinated staff training across all three levels of the Organization; the development of  electronic workflows on the now-paused Global Engagement Management system and the active  convening of the FENSA Proposal Review Committee, which appears to have convened  infrequently. ",1228
negative,A number of significant delays were observed between the immediacy of  implementation requested in the resolution and actual delivery timescales. ,1229
negative,"Furthermore, the  evaluation team noted evidence of a greater weighting of the risk management goals of the FENSA  in the implementation of its activities rather than in its promoting and engagement-enhancing  goals.",1230
negative,"While this progress to date offers WHO a solid platform on which to build, moving forward  there is a need to ensure that the dual objectives of the FENSA are equally emphasized. ",1231
negative,"Furthermore, owing to the dynamic organizational context in WHO, some activities and outputs completed to date are now in need of further iteration or development or require  supporting actions. ",1232
neutral,"Examples include (i) review of the FENSA guides and guidance to include  updates regarding the Register of non-State actors, electronic workflows and the composition of  the FENSA Proposal Review Committee; (ii) strengthening and delivery of training materials to  include lessons learned and practical examples; and (iii) ongoing maintenance of the FENSA focal  point network.",1233
negative,"Recognizing the achievement of the short-term results of implementation activities and outputs, sequencing and delivery delays have nonetheless impacted on the achievement of the  coherent and consistent implementation of the FENSA across all three levels of the Organization,4 which would lead to the comprehensive achievement of identified outcomes.5 ",1234
neutral,The overall implementation status of FENSA outputs and activities is summarized in Figure 1. ,1235
positive,"As illustrated in this figure, eight key activities and deliverables have been fully  completed or are near completion; six are ongoing with continued effort required; and three are  in need of immediate attention to either initiate or accelerate. ",1236
negative,"In addition, no financial  monitoring of the explicit or hidden costs of implementation has taken place. ",1239
positive,"A significant majority of stakeholders, both internal and external to WHO, are of the opinion that the FENSA has at least to some extent been successful in achieving its immediate  objectives. ",1240
positive,The FENSA has generally brought greater clarity for both WHO and non-State actors  around the requirements and standards for engagement. ,1241
negative,"hat said, translating policy into  practice for different kinds of engagement appears less clear, especially among WHO staff and  Member States.",1242
negative,The delegation of accountability for managed risk is not well understood. ,1243
positive,Stakeholders likewise believe that the FENSA has more generally brought greater coherence and consistency in WHO’s engagement with non-State actors.,1244
negative,"However,  implementation planning and roll-out has been insufficiently coordinated or integrated across  the Organization, resulting in inconsistent application of the FENSA.",1245
negative,"While the FENSA has contributed to demystifying the principles of WHO’s engagement with non-State actors, the inconsistent implementation of the FENSA and the shortcomings of the  Register of non-State actors have affected the perceived transparency of the process. ",1246
positive,"The FENSA has to some extent encouraged WHO staff and non-State actors to think more strategically about their engagement, especially when entering into official relations.",1247
negative,"It is less  evident for other types of engagement, while risk aversion (as opposed to risk awareness and risk  management) might be leading to missed opportunities for positive engagement. ",1248
positive,"It is likely that the FENSA has, by design, protected WHO from engaging with non-State actors that could jeopardize the credibility of its work",1249
negative,"At the same time, there is a sense among  some stakeholders that the FENSA has amplified organizational risk-averseness, with the result  that it may inadvertently be preventing otherwise positive engagements from occurring.",1250
negative, Information-sharing on the FENSA within WHO  remains largely informal and ad hoc. ,1251
negative,"As a key FENSA stakeholder group, Member States report  that they are not sufficiently informed about implementation and the difference it is making – despite routine updates to Member States by WHO – as this reporting is primarily geared towards  an account of activities and outputs.",1252
negative,"Given data paucity challenges, including the lack of an effective monitoring and evaluation mechanism as recommended in 20166 to ascertain whether intended benefits and results have  been achieved as set out, it is challenging to reliably assess sustainability or impact at this early  stage of FENSA’s implementation.

positive,"Nonetheless, based on the assessment of relevance, efficiency  and effectiveness, the evaluation team concludes that enabling conditions for sustainability and  impact7 are increasingly present.",1254
positive,"Notwithstanding the gaps and areas for improvement cited in the evaluation report, the  conditions for future impact and sustainability otherwise appear to be in place.",1255
positive,"These include  increasing levels of commitment to the FENSA from WHO’s senior management and Member  States; a recognition that increasing resources are needed to fully implement the FENSA; and a  gradual, steady and explicit shift toward greater tolerance for risk, particularly at senior  management levels, resulting in increased risk management. ",1256
positive,"t is additionally noted that the  FENSA yields mutual benefit for stakeholders; that it is easier to engage under the FENSA; and  that clarity has improved on how to work with non-State actors at country, regional and global  levels.",1257
negative,"At the same time, the burden of FENSA implementation is being significantly felt within  WHO, posing potential risks to its impact and sustainability moving forward. ",1258
negative,"Residual issues related to the coherence of FENSA’s implementation remain, both from a  policy coherence perspective – in particular related to the FENSA’s implications for procurement– and in terms of coherence with key reform initiatives, notably the transformation agenda, where  further coherence through integration and alignment is needed. ",1259
negative,WHO’s internal and external operating context has contributed to the challenges  encountered during implementation.,1260
negative,"These factors associated with its operating context include  the following:  • the realities of implementing change in a decentralized structure – and the nature of  implementing change where there exists shared institutional responsibly across the  levels of the Organization but no clear accountability;  • the need for organizational discipline to implement changes in behaviour, set against the  risk of institutional non-compliance with administrative processes; and  • the nascent state of several enabling conditions, identified in the factors affecting  implementation as set out below, which has limited the achievement of outcomes. ",1261
negative,"Despite considerable effort being exerted by WHO staff, who have worked hard to translate  policy into practice, a number of key factors affecting implementation are identified in the  evaluation. ",1262
negative,"These include the following: 31. The perception that senior management’s endorsement and support was initially lacking, and  that senior management had communicated mixed messages in the early implementation phase. ",1263
negative,This perceived lack of high-level support limited the catalytic conditions necessary for change  and muted mechanisms for buy-in across the Organization. ,1264
negative,"The absence of an overarching Organization-wide actionable implementation strategy for  engagement, comprised of specific, concrete actions to be undertaken in a phased way for  translating the broad goals of the FENSA into a concrete, actionable plan for the Organization’s  engagement with non-State actors; and for situating and calibrating the FENSA as a framework.",1265
negative,"As  such, it represents a critical linchpin affecting all other aspects of implementation and is thus  vii | P a g e worth emphasizing as a significant factor affecting all subsequent aspects of implementation,  namely in the following ways: • A comprehensive overview of what implementation would entail (scope) at the “global/ enterprise level” was ill-defined and the roll-out of implementation actions was insufficiently aligned, coordinated or integrated across all three levels of the Organization; • The timeframe for a full and complete implementation of both the FENSA and the operating procedures was overly optimistic about WHO’s capacity and capability to institute change effectively; • There was insufficient recognition of, and resourcing to meet, the challenges of enacting change within WHO’s decentralized structure, nor was implementation geared to capitalize on this structure by having coordinated action universally and uniformly applied across the three levels of the Organization – recommendations from a 2016 external audit on the implications of implementation in this regard do not appear to have been fully enacted; • Inter-dependencies between key mechanisms and tools to support implementation were underestimated, with implications for efficiency and cost-efficiency; limited progress in one area substantially affected progress in others (e.g. electronic workflow for the internal management of engagement using the Global Engagement Management system; or delays in delivery of guides, handbooks and training).",1266
negative,"Only limited outreach activities have been undertaken, while a coordinated process of harvesting  feedback and disseminating implementation success stories and lessons (i.e. what has worked in  various settings and why or how) has been lacking. ",1267
negative,"This absence has further reduced  opportunities for sensitization, familiarization and staff buy-in into the FENSA and its  implementation. ",1268
negative,"In addition to (and as a result of) the aforementioned factor of resource limitations  limiting the capacity to implement, there has been no dedicated capacity for FENSA’s  implementation beyond the specialized unit responsible for performing standard due diligence  and risk assessment, which constitutes only one facet of implementation. ",1269
negative,"Moreover, the  organizational structural changes as a result of the transformation agenda have affected the roles  and responsibilities of those designed to implement the FENSA (e.g. the composition of the FENSA  Proposal Review Committee and Steering Committee; alongside FENSA focal points).",1270
negative,"Staff  perception is that WHO is increasingly paralysed due to resolutions, rules, regulations and  frameworks without prioritization and that the FENSA as a major organizational endeavour has  been somewhat buried under a larger set of changes. ",1271
negative,"In addition, no financial monitoring of the explicit or hidden  implementation costs is taking place. ",1273
negative,"While progress reporting on implementation status has been provided through  regular reporting requirements, this reporting has predominantly been at the level of output and  activity rather than on the intended effects of the FENSA. ",1275
negative,The absence of an overall monitoring  and evaluation mechanism to ascertain whether intended benefits and results are achieved has  been a limiting factor. ,1276
negative,"As a result, there has been little systematic discussion or space for learning,  or of adaptation and fine-tuning of implementation approaches.",1277
neutral,"Accordingly, conclusions and  findings in the present evaluation represent the first such reflective juncture on the extent to  which intended results of the FENSA have been achieved at this early stage of implementation. ",1278
negative,The availability of instruments and information in all official languages of the Organization has been a constraint for staff and non-State actors alike where English is not a first language.,1279
neutral,"Alongside the aforementioned findings, the evaluation generated several lessons to help guide future implementation. ",1280
negative,"These lessons relate to:  • ensuring that a coordinated implementation strategy and plan are established early in the process and within the overall timeframe for delivery; • ensuring that the implementation strategy is signed off and “sponsored” at a sufficiently senior level to secure endorsement and buy-in across the three levels of the Organization; • ensuring the implementation strategy is clearly and widely communicated (e.g. through roadshows, townhall meetings, brown bag lunches or lunch-and-learn sessions, outreach and familiarization events); • setting realistic timeframes for delivery of the implementation plan based on available resources, ensuring full analysis of underlying assumptions and possible follow-on effects of interlinked activities and outputs; • bringing strong project management and change management knowledge, skills and experience to bear on implementation, as these are technical, professional disciplines in and of themselves that are complementary to the professional disciplines for which WHO is respected; • putting in place a strong oversight mechanism and team that are able to generate buy-in across the Organization (bearing in mind that proper oversight by WHO management and governance structures rests on a clear implementation plan and a results framework); • regularly monitoring – and adjusting as necessary – administrative procedures and processes in order to ensure that the balance between competing priorities and characteristics is weighted proportionately.",1281
negative,"While the evaluation  finds that no compelling evidence of this risk has materialized to date, continued vigilance  in this matter is advised to avoid possible adverse behaviours. ",1282
positive,"Recognizing the complexity of the intergovernmental negotiations required to agree on the FENSA and the considerable effort exerted by WHO staff to implement the FENSA in the spirit  of, and in alignment with, the principles it embodies, which forms a solid foundation moving  forward, the FENSA’s continued implementation should take account of the following  recommendations.

positive,"Additionally, WHO guidelines for WHO and CC staff as well as the  eManual provide details on how this alignment should take place. ",1347
positive,"In recent years, these changes have  led to a considerable reduction in the number of CCs, which has been achieved through the  discontinuation of inactive, ineffective and less strategically aligned CCs and through concerted efforts to designate or redesignate only those CCs that can contribute to WHO’s priorities. ",1348
positive,"As a result, most of  the work delivered by CCs is relevant to WHO’s GPW and aligned with GPW outcomes and outputs. ",1349
negative,"Despite this progress, a number of outstanding gaps have hindered the ability of CCs to ensure continued  relevance of their work to WHO’s priorities. ",1350
negative,"For example, despite the efforts to streamline the process  of designating and redesignating CCs and make it more strategic, there are still several inactive or  ineffective CCs, which may pose reputational risks for the Organization. ",1351
neutral,"Additionally, the previous  evaluation highlighted the need for WHO to have strategic plans that serve as a reference point for  selecting, designating and discontinuing CCs. ",1352
negative,"However, WHO still lacks a comprehensive organization- wide strategic plan for working with CCs that includes specific actions at the global, regional, and  technical programme area levels. ",1353
negative,"While some of the departments have developed and implemented such  plans with positive effects, others did not, mainly owing to the lack of engagement at the senior  management level and the lack of resources to support implementation and monitoring. ",1354

negative,"An analysis of the location  of the 822 currently designated CCs, which are based in 99 countries across all six WHO regions, reveals that there is an imbalance in the geographic distribution of CCs in favour of high-income countries and  specific regions. ",1375
neutral,"All told, fully one-third of all CCs are based in the European Region, while 24% are based  in the Western Pacific Region, 22% in the Region of the Americas, 13% in the South-East Asia Region, 5%  in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, and only 3% in the African Region. ",1376
neutral,"Furthermore, nearly 80% of all CCs are based in 22 countries, 13 of which are high-income countries.",1377
negative,"As a result, the potential of the CCs  to achieve maximum effectiveness globally is limited by the unevenness in their global presence and  reach. ",1378
positive,CC heads expressed that what they most value in their relationship with WHO is the contribution that  they make to global health outcomes by supporting WHO to fulfil its mandate.,1379
positive,"They also noted that the relationship helped CCs gain access to broader global networks  of CC institutions working in similar fields, thereby increasing their visibility at regional or global level. ",1380
positive,Increased involvement in policy-making processes was also identified as an important added value of the  collaboration with WHO.,1381
positive,"Moreover, some institutions apply the learning and good practices that emerge from their role as CCs across other programmes, thereby improving the quality and consistency of the  work delivered by their respective institutions more broadly. ",1382
negative,"Notwithstanding the aforementioned positive aspects of WHO’s work with CCs, there are a number of  areas in which WHO’s work with CCs has been less effective. ",1383
neutral,One of these areas relates to the monitoring  of the work delivered by CCs.,1384
negative,One of these areas relates to the monitoring  of the work delivered by CCs.,1385
negative,Stakeholders noted that internal processes for monitoring and reporting  could be improved.,1386
negative,"In particular, the heads of CCs expressed that the feedback they receive from WHO  staff on the annual reports that they submit does not meet expectations. ",1387
negative,"Additionally, numerous  stakeholders highlighted that there have been missed opportunities to assess the contribution of the  work of CCs to WHO’s results.",1388
negative,"Although this contribution is valued by WHO, opportunities forshowcasing the work of CCs both within WHO and externally have been limited. ",1389
negative,Interviews with WHO staff and heads of CCs also indicate that CCs often have workplans that are too  broad and therefore difficult to implement within the designation period. ,1390
negative,"Indeed, achieving the  ambitious objectives in these workplans would require additional resources and capacities. ",1391
negative,"Therefore,  they expressed that there is room for further improving the planning process to ensure that the identified  objectives are clear and realistic. ",1392
negative,"Such broad workplans, on the one hand, allow flexibility for them to  adapt to WHO’s priorities, as these can shift during the designation period.; on the other hand, the  breadth of these workplans often entails a need for more resources and capacity if the CCs are to fully  utilise and to demonstrate tangible results.",1393
positive,The evaluation identified several key factors that have enabled CCs to work effectively and overcome  their challenges.,1395
positive,These include: effective communication between CCs and WHO from the planning stage  to implementation and monitoring; effective planning processes that are facilitated by an open and transparent discussion on the roles of key stakeholders and expectations vis-à-vis the relationship.,1396
positive,"CC  heads also underlined that networks of CCs working in the same or similar areas is a key factor enabling  the achievement of results, although some also mentioned that more networking opportunities is  warranted.",1397
positive,"They further noted that the WHO CC “brand” is a key factor that enables CCs to fulfil their  role as it increases the institution’s visibility and trust by the Government, partners and donors, and,  consequently allows the institution to mobilise additional resources.",1398
positive,Other enabling factors include  positive working relationships between CCs and WHO based on mutual trust and the presence of a  strategy or approach guiding WHO’s work with CCs. ,1399
negative,Other key  challenges faced by the CCs include: ambiguity over WHO’s expectations; lack of joint planning; the  administrative burden of the designation and redesignation process; and lack of transparent  communication – especially in relation to the reasons for delays in the approval of proposals. ,1402
negative,Stakeholders also noted that there is a need for WHO to better communicate to CCs its changing  priorities.,1403
negative,An assessment of the efficiency of WHO’s work with CCs reveals a mixed picture. ,1404
positive,"On the one hand, there  has been considerable improvement in ensuring that inactive CCs do not continue to hold the CC  designation, thus helping to avoid an overstretch of already-limited capacities for CC engagements. ",1405
positive,"Improvements in the designation and redesignation process have reportedly helped in identifying institutions that have the capacity, resources and expertise to contribute optimally to WHO’s results. ",1406
positive,Human and financial resourcing of the CCs represents a distinct and considerable aspect of efficiency. ,1407
negative,"WHO does not provide any financial resourcesto CCs for the implementation of their workplan, although  it does dedicate significant staff time.",1408
positive,"By contrast, WHO CCs contribute significant levels of financial,  human and technical resources to WHO.",1409
positive,"Stakeholders highlighted that having a strategic planning  process in place at the regional, department or technical programme area level is essential to ensure  that financial and technical resources are used efficiently and strategically, and that there is no  duplication of efforts.",1410
neutral,CC heads also explained that part of their role as CCs is to respond to ad hoc  requests to implement activities that are emerging priorities for WHO.,1411
positive,"CCs tend to see these ad hoc  activities as an important element of their role, particularly in emergency situations.",1412
positive,"hey further noted  that mobilizing resources within a short timeframe has proved challenging, although CCs have responded  to these requests in a timely manner.",1413
positive,"In this regard, CCs are perceived as highly cost-effective means of  achieving the goals of the GPW. ",1414
negative,"At the same time, several challenges have hampered the efficiency of WHO’s work with the CCs.",1415
negative,"In  particular, there are substantial costs incurred by WHO in managing its work with CCs.",1416
negative,"These costs mainly  involve the staff time of ROs and TCs, the majority of whom are senior-level officials, and those involved  in decision-making on the designation and redesignation process – e.g., directors, Assistant Directors- General, Global and Regional Focal Points, and the FENSA due diligence team.",1417
negative,"Although it is difficult to  monetize the exact value of such human investments, they are not negligible. ",1418
negative,"However, considering the  substantial amount of time that most ROs and some TCs spend undertaking CC-related work, this aspect  of their work is rarely reflected in their Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) plans and performance assessments.",1419
negative,"Most fundamentally, despite the significant investment of human  resource capacity in CC-related work, there has been a significant (some stakeholders say urgent) need  for additional capacity to support the management of CCs at the global and regional levels – as well as  for training and support for staff, especially surrounding good practice in working with CCs and awareness  of the requirements of the FENSA due diligence process. ",1420
negative,"Other major efficiency-related concerns centre on: administrative and management systems; lack of joint  decision-making on the designation and redesignation process of CCs, coupled with delays in these processes; the lack of transparent communication on the reasons for delays in approving a proposal and  reasons for discontinuing a designation; as well as a lack of awareness of the work CCs deliver, both internally within WHO as well as externally. ",1421
neutral,"For example, the administrative and management systems currently in place support both CCs and WHO  staff throughout the process of designation and redesignation. ",1422
positive,These systems also support CC and WHO  staff in planning and delivering CC activities. ,1423
negative,"However, those who use this system report that it is not as  efficient or robust as it could be.",1424
negative,"In particular, they indicate that the Electronic Collaborating Centres  (eCC) system could be made more user-friendly and that the approval steps could be streamlined. ",1425
negative,They also noted that the system could allow for more flexibility in the permitted formats of eCC submissions.,1426
negative,"Delays in the designation and redesignation process reportedly stem from: (a) a lack of engagement of  all decision-makers from the beginning of the process; (b) the time required for due diligence review under FENSA; (c) delays in taking decisions on whether to continue or discontinue a CC; and (d) the  vi cyclical nature of the system, which requires that when feedback is provided at any point in the  designation and redesignation process, it is resubmitted at the start of the system for approval by all  stakeholders.",1427
negative,"hese delays have resulted in a loss of momentum in the relationship, missed opportunities, mistrust, and negative expectations of working with WHO. ",1428
negative,Communication between WHO staff and CCs is cited as another area in which timeliness and quality are  less than optimal.,1429
negative,"In this vein, there is a substantial difference in the perception of WHO staff and heads of CCs surrounding the regularity of such communication.",1430
negative,"Whereas the vast majority of WHO staff who  directly work with CCs mentioned that communication with the CCs occurs twice a year, over half of the  heads of CCs noted that communication with WHO only happens once year. ",1431
negative,"As noted above,  communication that feeds into monitoring systems presents a particularly significant challenge. ",1432
negative,The internal and external lack of awareness of the work CCs deliver for WHO is seen as being the result  of a lack of regular and formal communication processes. ,1433
negative,"This lack of awareness has reduced opportunities to apply a more strategic approach to planning and implementing the work of CCs and to maximise the potential use of existing CCs to achieve major health objectives in an effective, efficient  manner. ",1434
positive,The designation of a new CC or redesignation of an existing CC has been most effective when there is a  strategic approach in place to ensure the relevance of the work of the CC and its alignment with WHO’s  priorities.,1435
positive,"Where there has been a systematic and transparent mechanism in place for approving  designation/redesignation proposals, for engaging senior management, and for communicating decisions on the designation or redesignation of a CCs in a timely manner, it was easier for Responsible Officers to  manage WHO’s relationships with CCs. ",1436
negative,"Continued designation and redesignation of ineffective and  inactive CCs resulting from internal or external pressures could reduce the relevance of the work of the  CCs to WHO’s priorities, and entails potential reputational risks. ",1437
positive,"The effectiveness of CCs has been enhanced in situations where there is a regional, departmental or  network strategy in place.",1438
neutral,"These strategies often cover approaches to the identification, designation and  redesignation of CCs, as well as the management and review of CCs and their work. ",1439
positive,The development  and use of strategies for working with CCs by WHO staff and senior managers has increased the  effectiveness of the CCs work and maximized their contribution. ,1440
negative,"Moving forward, there is a potential for WHO to work more effectively and efficiently with CC by establishing clear strategic plans, leadership and decision-making processes at the highest levels to  formulate WHO’s future approach of working with CCs.",1441
negative,An organizational strategy for working with CCs  could improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the work delivered by CCs.,1442
negative,"Likewise, the use of  networks of CCs working in the same or similar technical areas can help CCs maximize their contribution  to WHO’s results. ",1443
negative,There are several specific challenges faced by CCs based in low- and middle-income countries. ,1444
negative,"Understanding their specific needs, challenges and capacities will likely help WHO staff to effectively  manage those CCs and support the CCs to perform more efficiently going forward.",1445

neutral,The evaluation was conducted between  April and July 2018 by a team from the WHO Evaluation Office.,1472
positive,"The priorities identified in the CCS 2014-2018 and updated in its 2016 revision were relevant to  address Rwanda’s major health needs and were coherent with government and partners’ priorities, as expressed in the Third Rwandan Health Sector Strategic Plan (July 2012-June 2018) and the United  Nations Development Assistance Plan (UNDAP). ",1473
positive,They were also coherent with 12th General  Programme of Work in terms of health needs and alignment.,1474
positive,To a large extent this is a reflection of  good joint planning by key parties.,1475
positive,"The systematic needs assessments and wide consultations that took place during the formulation of  both versions of the CCS 2014-2018, and the ongoing engagement with the key national  stakeholders, including the Ministry of Health and other relevant health sector institutions, UN  agencies and other development partners, helped to facilitate the coherence and relevance of the  strategic choices. ",1476
positive,"Furthermore, the evaluation has shown that the WCO is a relevant actor in the formulation of the  national strategic plans of the Ministry of Health, both at the sector-wide level and specifically in  relevant technical areas; as well as in the formulation of the newly developed UNDAP2, thus  facilitating a high degree of alignment and coherence of the WCO with the national and  development partners’ strategies in Rwanda as they develop over time. ",1477
neutral,"In recent years, Rwanda has shown dramatic progress in most observed health and development  indicators. ",1478
positive,"As part of the continuing commitment of the Government to achieve rapid  socioeconomic development, the Ministry of Health drives the health agenda and places demands on the WCO for an innovative, fast, highly skilled and focused approach along Government priorities. ",1479
neutral,"In this context, any CCS needs to be a dynamic and evolving instrument.",1480
positive,"The revision of the CCS  2014-2018 in 2016, in response to the significant progress in achieving the Millennium Development  Goals and the new Sustainable Development Goal agenda, is an example of WCO leadership and  commitment to adapt the WHO CCS to the evolving situation and its intention to respond in the  most effective manner to the needs of Rwandan people. ",1481
positive,"Consequently, the CCS includes an extensive number of focus areas without clear prioritization. ",1482
negative,"Therefore, the CCS is responsive but provides limited guidance for strategic planning of WCO activities.",1483
positive,"While there is no explicit reference to gender issues or gender-affirmative approaches in the CCS,  most stakeholders consider gender equality to be part and parcel of WHO’s work and approaches. ",1484

positive,"WHO, through its WCO in Rwanda, is seen as a respected and technically expert voice in health  matters and an essential contributor to advancing health achievements in Rwanda.",1486
positive,The technical  support of WHO seemed highly valued. ,1487
positive,"The WCO’s leadership and support for the health agenda  were considered essential by the Ministry of Health and most development partners, including  United Nations agencies. ",1488
positive,"The work of WHO was most notable in terms of convening partners; providing strategic and  technical policy advice; provision and local adaptation of guidelines, norms and standards; and  capacity building.",1489
positive,"In that context, it is apparent that the WCO has accomplished a great deal in many  different areas and that staff and counterparts are justifiably proud of what has been achieved.",1490
positive,Specific achievements highlighted during the evaluation which are particularly significant are in the  areas of support for development of health sector strategies and plans (i.e. the Third and Fourth  Rwandan Health Sector Strategic Plans); technical assistance in the area of health financing;  development of several disease-specific strategies and plans; normative and technical support in  maternal and child care and family planning; introduction of new vaccines; and improvements in  certification of causes of death.,1491
positive," It is notable that many of these accomplishments came about as a  result of highly effective collaboration with Ministry of Health and other partners, and also at the  three levels of the Organization. ",1492
negative,"Noncommunicable diseases, particularly from a disease management point of view, and nutrition  showed less progress and achievements, as did environmental health and social determinants of  health. ",1493
negative,The fact that such programmes require strengthened cross-sectoral coordination and a  multidisciplinary approach may pose additional strains on WHO’s ways of working. ,1494
negative,"Nevertheless,  gaps in these areas flag the need to reconsider the role of WHO and its approach to these issues and  multisectorality. ",1495
negative,"In particular, given the importance of addressing noncommunicable diseases and  chronic malnutrition in Rwanda, these areas become important priorities for WHO work in the near  future.",1496
negative,It is noted that mental health was not well featured in the WCO workplans.,1497
negative,"Some stakeholders highlighted the need for strengthening the focus of some WHO activities, which  call for reinforced results-based planning at the workplan level.",1498
negative,"Furthermore, stakeholders’  expectations called for a renewed focus of WHO’s work on new priority areas such as supporting  district services planning and the quality of health services; strengthening data quality and health  information systems; digital health; and, in particular, identifying mechanisms to ensure the financial  sustainability of the health system and regulatory strengthening.",1499
negative,"There is also demand for broader  WHO engagement in terms of supporting collaborative regional and subregional frameworks in  order to enable the exchange and sharing of best practices with other peer countries as well as for  facilitating the establishment of joint approaches to address common threats, such as communicable  diseases (i.e. malaria). ",1500
negative,"Facing a growing demand for new and more technically sophisticated work, and considering the  potential for misalignment of, or overriding, the CCS 2014-2018 strategic priorities with additional  requests, the WCO needs to develop clear criteria for adapting its workplan and office capacity to  the changing circumstances and requirements, while keeping in mind the new 13th General  Programme of Work and the needs of the Rwandan people. ",1501
negative,"As has been the case until very recently for most programmatic planning in WHO, the WCO workplan  followed the overall guidelines provided by the CCS 2014-2018, the 12th General Programme of  Work and the respective programme budgets, but lacked a country-specific, measurable results framework and “theory of change” to guide the identification of the activities and projects that were  most effective to achieve the WCO strategic priorities and expected outcomes.",1502
negative,"In the absence of  such guiding framework, it is difficult for the evaluation to ascertain from the observed office  deliverables the extent of achievement of the strategic priorities and expected outcomes assigned to  the office. ",1503
positive,"However, the evaluation found much anecdotal evidence of WHO’s contribution to long- term changes in health status. ",1504
positive,All core functions demonstrated their relevance for WHO’s  work in Rwanda.,1505
positive,"Notably, the evaluation showed evidence of effective WCO leadership and  convening power, policy advice, provision of technical support, capacity building, and monitoring the  health status and trends along the key strategic priority areas identified in the CCS 2014-2018. ",1506
negative,"Nevertheless, several stakeholders identified opportunities for WHO to provide more direct support  on strategy and policy issues at senior levels of the ministry, and furthermore to become a stronger  advocate around unmet health priorities within and beyond the health sector through intersectoral  iv engagement (such as for noncommunicable diseases and social determinants of health).",1507
negative,Stakeholders also expected WHO to be more proactive and solution oriented in terms of  strengthening Rwandan institutions. ,1508
negative,"They also requested WHO’s support to strengthen regional  cooperation and facilitate knowledge management, including sharing of best practices and exchange  of experiences, at the regional and subregional levels. ",1509
positive," In general, partner relationships appear to be good and supportive of effective joint  working.",1510
positive,The part played by inter-personal factors in building and maintaining such positive  relationships was noted by several stakeholders. ,1511
neutral,"At the Government level, the main partnership was established through the Ministry of Health.",1512
negative,"While this relationship was characterized as constructive and effective, a similar relationship at the  district level was less clear.",1513
negative,"Likewise, relationships with other ministries and sectors were much less  advanced leading to some concerns in terms of the intersectoral engagement that would be  required to address the social determinants of health and the challenges of noncommunicable  diseases in Rwanda. ",1514

positive,WHO leadership in the development of  UNDAP2 was recognized. ,1521
negative,The “Delivering as One” framework was characterized as showing some operational limitations given  that it requires the commitment of agencies to move beyond their corporate interests.,1522
positive,"However, it  provides WHO the opportunity to work intersectorally and engage in new partnerships.",1523
neutral,"Nevertheless,  it appeared that UNDAP had little practical impact on WCO’s day-to-day activities and could not be  shown to have contributed significantly to WCO outcomes. ",1524

neutral,Funding remains critical for WHO’s catalytic engagement in the country. ,1526
negative,"In addition, reliance on earmarked funding  resulted in some disparities among resources allocated to individual programme areas.",1528
negative,Timely  receipt of funding was also identified as a challenge by a number of stakeholders,1529
negative,"Misalignment  between the financial cycles of WHO and the Government of Rwanda, as well as differences in their  respective budgeting and planning processes, resulted in funding issues and implementation delays  for some programmes. ",1530
positive,"Staff of the WCO were recognised for their hard work and dedication, often across  portfolios that were viewed as being demanding in terms of their breadth and diversity.",1531
negative,"At the same  time, there were signals of evident gaps in staffing capacity for priority areas and for needed  enabling functions, and several staff were responsible for very heavy portfolios, which could not be  fully delivered. ",1532
negative,Some stakeholders expressed concern about the adequacy of WHO staffing. ,1533
negative,"The need to continuously upgrade the technical skills and expertise of WHO staff, particularly in view of the  strong Government expectations to receive innovative solutions and highly-skilled support, was  widely recognized throughout the evaluation. ",1534
negative,t was suggested that a WCO with more senior  personnel with clearly targeted responsibilities might be better equipped to respond to the  country’s needs.,1535
neutral,Most technical areas are staffed by National Professional Officers. ,1536

negative,Hence  there is a need to consider the appropriate mix of international professionals and National  Professional Officers that adequately responds to the emerging needs of the country. ,1538
positive,The plan to engage senior United Nations Volunteers to work in technical roles within the WCO is a  notable innovation to provide the necessary additional capacity for the office. ,1539
negative,The difficulty in measuring results against planned targets and assessing WHO’s  contributions to the same are indications of a number of systemic challenges in planning and  monitoring processes within WHO at both corporate and country levels. ,1540

neutral,The primary audience for this evaluation includes CO  management and personnel; relevant staff in target  ministries; relevant Civil Society Organizations (CSOs);  donors; target beneficiary communities and groups;  UN agencies involved as partners in joint programmes;  and UN Women regional offices in Western and Central  Africa.,1582
positive,The CO was demonstrably adept at evolving its  strategic position vis- à-vis gender equality  and women’s empowerment and changing  priorities in the country context.,1583
positive,CONCLUSION 1: UN Women’s strategic positioning  within Nigeria and the choice of interventions were  broadly relevant to GEWE needs; emerging security and  humanitarian issues; and the operating context of its  thematic areas (both at the national and subnational  level).,1584
positive,"Although the balance of thematic priorities  was mainly driven by funding availability, the CO was  broadly doing the right things across its portfolio.",1585
positive,The CO’s normative work is its strongest  comparative advantage.,1586
positive,"CONCLUSION 2: The CO recorded significant achieve- ment in its normative mandates, ensuring that Nigeria  fulfils its international commitments; supporting  the adoption of international instruments; and the  enhancement of gender-responsive systems, laws and  policies.",1587
negative,"However, the process of embedding changes  in policy at the state and local government level was  a daunting task.",1588
negative,"This proved challenging, particularly  as it levied high demand for UN Women resources and  staff time.",1589
positive,The CO was viewed as strong and vocal in  amplifying the voices of women in various  strategic discourses. ,1590
positive,CONCLUSION 3: The CO enjoyed a good degree of  legitimacy in the gender space.,1591
positive,There was near  unanimous recognition that the CO’s advocacy efforts  and closely developed partnerships with a wide range  of stakeholders amplified the voices of women in  various strategic discourses.,1592
positive,"These efforts enhanced the  strategic positioning of the CO’s leadership, which was  viewed as strong and vocal in bringing GEWE issues  to the forefront.",1593
negative,"However, given the size of Nigeria’s  population and the challenges in gender equality, the  same cannot necessarily be said for the CO’s technical  competency and resource capacity.",1594
negative,"This assessment  was occasioned, in part, by a perception of UN Women  as poorly resourced and therefore in some areas lacking  the in-house technical capacity to generate the highest  quality analyses and advisory on emerging GEWE issues  (particularly within a wide range of economic, social  and environmental dimensions). ",1595
neutral,Policy level work alone will not stimulate the kind of change required in Nigeria.,1596
positive,"CONCLUSION 4: The complexity of Nigeria’s three- tiered federalism (the national, state and local  governments), and institutional context, positioned  multi-level interventions as the most strategic and  effective model to stimulate transformative change  across the different levels of governance.",1597
positive,"To a certain  extent, the CO’s approach of combining policy-level  work with state-level interventions proved effective  in consolidating policy gains; building the capacity of  gender machinery; and facilitating the adoption and  popularization of legislative frameworks in target  states. ",1598
positive,"For instance, this approach yielded promising  results in Women, Peace and Security (WPS).",1599
positive,The WPS programme had some impactful  results at the policy and institutional level and in influencing social norm changes. ,1600
positive,"CONCLUSION 5: Significant funding combined with a  multi-year, multi-level and multi-stakeholder approach  enabled UN Women to achieve considerable impact in  the WPS programmatic area and allowed replication  beyond targeted states. ",1601
negative,"However, a more effective  and sustainable outcome would have been achieved  with better planning; earlier identification of suitable  Programme Partners (PPs); and a risk-based plan orga- nized before the start of project implementation.n",1602
negative,"Despite the capacity surge, the CO had a highly constrained staffing structure.",1603
negative,"CONCLUSION 6: Despite a recent capacity surge and  a very committed and dedicated workforce, the CO’s  current ‘staffing structure’ remains antithetical to  building a stable and technically sound team. ",1604
negative,"n this  context, the CO faced difficulties in delivering on its  ambitious SN and in playing a strategic role as a liaison  with ECOWAS.",1605
negative,"Although some internal and external factors were unavoidable, pragmatic and coherent planning could have yielded greater efficiency. ",1606
negative,"CONCLUSION 7: Although some internal and external  factors were unavoidable, pragmatic and coherent  planning could have yielded greater efficiency.",1607

negative,The fragmented nature of some projects both in terms of funding and duration offset long- term benefits and sustainability. ,1609
positive,"CONCLUSION 8: At the policy level, the CO helped  create an environment that enabled the adoption of  gender-friendly legislative frameworks, policies and  strategies, some of which could be attributed to the  long-standing support of UN Women. ",1610

neutral,A number of limitations were identified during both  the inception and fieldwork phases.,1640
neutral,Those identified  during the inception phase were addressed in the  methodology,1641
neutral,"For example, the period of the evalua- tion coincided with the creation of UN Women and  while the transition to UN Women had been complet- ed, the consolidation of new organizational processes  was still underway",1642
neutral,The evaluation thus took note of  the organizational challenges associated with the  early days of this consolidation process.,1643
neutral,"Furthermore,  the evaluation period straddled two strategic plan- ning periods.",1644
neutral,The evaluation was therefore used to draw les- sons from the experience of predecessor entities on  relevant peace and security work to inform current  and future practice.,1645
neutral,"Also, a full assessment of UN  Women’s humanitarian response (HR) capacity was  not possible as it is a new work area for UN Women,  as noted in the inception phase. ",1646
neutral,It was also considered  important to ensure an appropriate balance in the  assessment of operations and programming vis-à-vis  global policy work. ,1647
neutral,"Therefore, a case study of activities  at headquarters was undertaken, alongside the desk  studies and fieldwork of country-level programming  and operations. ",1648
neutral,"Although primary documents (those  created by UN Women and predecessor entities) were  an important source of data for the evaluation, the  availability and quality of documents at headquarters  and country level varied.",1649
neutral,"Finally, the complex and sensi- tive nature of the peace and security and humanitarian  response agenda means that much of the critical work  is not documented through conventional results- based frameworks",1650

negative,UN Women’s programme and project results chains  are rarely underpinned by clear causal relationships  between activities and expected results.,1766
negative,"There is much  stronger evidence on ‘low-level’ results and outputs  than on higher-level outcomes due to weak pro- gramme design and a lack of theories of change which  are based on realistic objectives, appropriate activities  and plausible linkages.",1767

negative,"A knowledge base is essential to im- proving programming, including the development and  testing of sound theories of change. ",1774
negative,The emphasis on  bureaucratic accountability rather than learning from  evaluation also limits the entity’s ability to assess the  continuing relevance of programmes and adapt them  as conditions change – an almost certain requirement  in volatile fragile and conflict-affected settings – to en- able strategic objectives (rather than defunct outputs)  to be achieved.,1775
negative,"Conclusion 11: There is a disconnect between global  policy and normative engagement/priorities, and  country programmes and operations.",1776

positive,The joint gender programmes analysed all prove  contextually-relevant to broad national gender needs. ,1843
positive,They were all aligned with stated national strategies  or plans and referenced normative frameworks whose  commitments they aimed to serve. ,1844
negative,"However, due in large part to under-investment in the  design process, relevance was compromised by the  absence of a consistently clear line of sight to gender  priorities on the ground and the lack of a system- atic application of the human rights-based approach. ",1845
negative,"Designs were marked by high  levels of ambition in efforts to tackle systemic and  deep-rooted gender inequalities within short time  frames, with limited resources and with little or no  prior experience of the joint gender modality. ",1846
negative,"Many joint gender programmes therefore showed  misplaced confidence in the capability of the national  operating architecture and partners, and the capacity  of the United Nations system itself, to absorb a joint  modality.",1847

positive,Key findings of the evaluation include  the following: • The GEC Action was effective at  strengthening the capacities of EC/WGs  to develop improved EiE strategies and  needs assessments in countries that  received the most support.,2099
positive,The GEC Action was generally well-aligned  with both the coordination needs of EC/ WGs and the GEC strategy. ,2100
positive,"It addressed  systemic and well-recognized EiE coor- dination capacity gaps and provided an  appropriate mix of mutually reinforcing  services to EC/WGs, as intended in the  GEC strategy. ",2101
negative,"However, GEC supply did not always  coincide with EC/WG demand, and  questions arose about the availability,  combination and sequencing of services.",2102
negative,"Without consistent cluster coordination  performance monitoring (CCPM), the  GEC also lacked systematic information  about EC/WG coordination gaps to guide  implementation.",2103
positive,The GEC Action was implemented in  an efficient way. ,2104
positive,"It managed to provide  an impressive number of services in a  short time and at relatively low cost,  and partnership agreements allowed  the GEC Action to leverage some useful  additional resources.",2105
negative,"Across the countries assisted, EC/WGs  were mostly functional even without sup- port provided under the GEC Action, but  capacity was often insufficient to enable  development of joint plans or multi-year  coordination approaches.",2106
positive,"Most EC/WGs sought to promote EiE  connectedness with development-oriented  education actors and strategies. EC/WGs  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 5 frequently conducted needs assessments  in collaboration with ministries of edu- cation and developed comprehensive  EiE strategies explicitly aligned with  ministry of education priorities, national  education strategies, sector plans, and/ or development coordination strategies.",2107
negative,"However, needs assessments were rarely  conducted in collaboration with local edu- cation groups, and EC/WGs faced various  challenges in actually achieving ‘connect- edness’ to development in EiE strategies,  despite their efforts to do so.",2108
negative,"In addition, while progress was made in  including governments and national NGOs  in strategy development and implemen- tation, results would have been stronger  with a more explicit focus on building the  capacities of government partners and  NGOs, especially at subnational level.",2109
positive,"The GEC Action strengthened EC/WG  strategy-development processes in the nine  most assisted countries, resulting in the pub- lication of standalone EiE strategies that went  beyond the requirements of contributing to the  humanitarian response plan.",2110
positive,"These strategies  are expected to guide partners in their imple- mentation of an effective, timely and quality  emergency response.",2111
positive,"The GEC Action strengthened the capacities  of EC/WGs for needs assessment, resulting  in evolving competencies for secondary data  review, increased awareness of skill gaps  (notably in data analysis and information  management) and advanced skills in joint  needs assessments.",2112
positive,"The GEC Action may have contributed to  more effective responses in the countries  assisted. The evaluation team argues that the  strengthened EC/WG strategy development  processes made possible through GEC support  6 Evaluation of the Global Education Cluster Action, 2017-2019: “Strengthening Coordination of Education in Emergencies”  have likely also helped the delivery of more  “predictable, timely, effective and appropriate  education responses”.",2113
positive,"At the humanitarian system level, the GEC  Action produced useful updated EiE guidance  and tools, and increased global and regional  EiE coordination skills.",2114
positive,The GEC training  activities conducted at global and regional  levels raised awareness of applied coordi- nation requirements and core competencies  among a growing community of EiE actors. ,2115
positive,"To some extent, this contributed to building  global and regional ‘talent’ pools of potential  cluster coordinators. ",2116
positive,"In one or two cases,  there was evidence of coordinators planning  and implementing improved coordination and  more effective EiE responses after completing  a regional training (NE Nigeria, Cameroon).",2117
positive,GEC support services directly strengthened  EC/WG capacities.,2118
positive,"The improvements in EC/ WG capabilities were achieved by the delivery  of support services that were to some extent  tailored, mixed and mutually reinforcing. ",2119
positive,"During the period 2017-2019, these mixed ser- vices were applied proactively in 19 countries,  thereby maximizing coverage in response  to demand or when supply was available. ",2120
positive,Country-level training and coaching were seen  as particularly effective.,2121
positive,It also seems clear  that the new joint education needs assessment  (JENA) training is appreciated thanks to its  innovative coaching and ‘learning by doing’  design.,2122
positive,"Without this mix of applied services, it  is unlikely EC/WG capacities would have been  enhanced by the GEC. ",2123
positive,The GEC Action design enabled proactive  implementation of activities. ,2124
positive,The project  design allowed enough flexibility in implemen- tation to include a range of GEC activities and  a proactive delivery-focused approach.,2125
positive,"This  was a suitable design for a start-up phase that  favoured practical, actionable plans and their  implementation. ",2126
positive,"The project was designed  to address acute emergencies, for example  through rapid deployment of rapid response  team (RRT) capacity, but it was also able  to adapt to the requirements of protracted  emergencies.",2127
positive,The GEC had the required resources to  function from 2017-2019.,2128
positive,The GEC Action  benefited substantially from essential financial  and human resources made possible through  funding from DG ECHO as well as policy sup- port form the European Union.,2129
positive,"Funding from  DG ECHO enabled the GEC to carry out its core  functions, and to leverage additional resources  from partners, leading to the development  of a larger project with Education Cannot  Wait.",2130
positive,"During this time, GEC human resources  and expert service providers quadrupled  in number. ",2131
positive,"The increased resources in part  reflected growing policy interest in EiE, but the  GEC strategy revision and proactive leadership  during this phase was an essential element.",2132
neutral,Strengthening capacities required a basic level  of EC/WG functionality and willingness,2133
neutral,"The  GEC Action presupposed the existence of a  functioning EC/WG that was aware of its own  capacity gaps and willing to invest the time,  effort and resources necessary to address  them.",2134
negative,"This could not be taken for granted,  as EC/WGs and coordinators were often  under-resourced, overworked and absorbed by  operational demands.",2135
neutral,Strengthening EC/WG capacities required  dedicated and competent coordination  actors. ,2136
neutral,There was also a need for a dedicated  information management officer.,2137
positive,"Without  these dedicated and competent coordination  actors, the functionality of the EC/WG could  not be assured and it would have been diffi- cult or impossible for the GEC to strengthen  EC/WG capacities.",2138
neutral,Dedicated and competent coordination actors  required strategic investments by cluster lead  agencies (CLAs).,2139
neutral,"Above all, it was necessary  for the UNICEF representative and the Save  the Children country director to invest stra- tegically in the EC/WG as an effective means  of fulfilling their obligations to children in  emergencies beyond their own programmes,  and to hold themselves accountable for the  effectiveness of this modality and meeting  collective targets.",2140
neutral,EC/WG functionality depended on EiE part- ners participating in and jointly owning the  mechanism.,2141
neutral,"Participation could be indicated  by the number of partners involved in needs  assessment and strategy development; by the  diversity of partners involved (government  actors, international and national NGOs, and  United Nations agencies); or by the quality/ degree of involvement of key EiE actors. ",2142
neutral,"Ultimately, participation depended on partners  perceiving an interest in their participation. ",2143
positive,"Strengthened capacity and GEC support was  often associated with increased participa- tion, so a circular dynamic appeared to be  at work whereby increased participation led  to better coordination, which in turn led to  increased participation.",2144
neutral,"The purpose of the evaluation was twofold: 1) to evaluate the effectiveness of the UNICEF’s Early Childhood  Development (ECD) kit interventions on children’s psychosocial well-being, early learning and development in a  humanitarian context; and 2) to evaluate the relevance and effectiveness of different approaches for improving  caregiver interactions with children and the use of the ECD kits for early learning and development.",2150

positive,The ECD kit toys and learning materials are an enrichment resource that can be integrated  into existing early childhood programs or emergency response strategies to enhance early learning and  development opportunities for young children by strengthening the linkage with play.,2158
neutral,"Therefore, the evaluation  tried to isolate how well and to what the ECD kit interventions leveraged the toys and learning materials for play- based teaching and learning, and what factors contributed to their effective integration and use by caregivers  into the ECD settings within the Bidibidi refugee settlement. ",2159
neutral,Two distinct training approaches for using the ECD kits were implemented in Uganda in response to the  humanitarian crisis in South Sudan and were compared in this evaluation – the foundational and the enhanced  ECD kit interventions. ,2160
neutral,The foundational ECD kit intervention involved the provision of the ECD Kit along with  the Activity Guide on how to use the toys and learning materials that is included within the kit.,2161
neutral,"Caregivers did not  receive direct training on the ECD kits, but received 3-5 days of training unique to the NGO partner providing  services.",2162
neutral,"The foundational intervention was implemented by NGO partners including Plan International, World  Vision, and Transcultural Psychosocial Organization Uganda with approximately 100 caregivers through two  delivery models: ECD centres and child friendly spaces in the Bidibidi refugee settlement.

neutral,"The enhanced intervention was  also offered to all caregivers in the Bidibidi refugee settlement, regardless of delivery model, and potentially  included the same 100 caregivers who were involved in the Foundational ECD kit interventions (although reports  and evidence of caregiver turnover was high). ",2165
neutral,"The rationale for the enhanced intervention included a desire of  the national government to harmonize and standardize their ECD trainings to improve the quality of all ECD  learning settings, regardless of delivery model or implementing organization. ",2166
neutral,t was also based upon the  recognition that additional training in the ECD neurosciences would elevate caregiver and parent understandings  of the importance of early childhood and of play in supporting child development.,2167
neutral,"Finally, there was an interest in  exploring how the traditional forms of play could enrich the relevance and sustainability of the ECD kits. ",2168
neutral,"The enhanced ECD kit intervention was implemented by the Ministry of Education and Sports with UNICEF’s  technical assistance and included an increased training dosage (from three to five days of one-off trainings under  the foundational intervention to three, five-day face-to-face sessions over nine months) for all early childhood  caregivers in ECD concepts and skills; the integration of the ECD neurosciences into parenting programs and  caregiver training (including the use of stories or graphics to convey important message); and a parenting  education program with home visits with more than 600 participants across 18 sites in the Bidibidi refugee  settlement. ",2169
neutral,"In addition, a local toymaking innovation was examined to understand if there were any added  benefits or challenges when integrating this activity within the parenting program. ",2170
neutral,The primary objective of the evaluation was to document and analyse the benefits and challenges of the ECD  kit interventions for children and their caregivers through a formative evaluation design that could yield  judgments on the effectiveness of different training approaches. ,2171
neutral,"A secondary, but related objective of the  evaluation, was to assess the relevance of the ECD kit interventions in relation to the country and  programming context.",2172
neutral,"To ensure UNICEF’s equity agenda was addressed, the evaluation also included an  approach for analysing the relevance and effectiveness of the ECD kit interventions for different subgroups, such  as children with differing abilities, and girls and boys from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as relevant to  the selected contexts.

neutral,"Evaluation Question 1: How relevant were the ECD kit interventions in relation to country context, children, and  women’s rights, and UNICEF’s equity agenda?",2181
positive,Both the foundational and enhanced ECD kit interventions were relevant for UNICEF’s equity agenda and its  objectives for ECD programming in the country. ,2182
positive,"UNICEF reached highly vulnerable women and children through these interventions, including  unaccompanied children providing care for their younger siblings. ",2183
positive,"The findings indicate consistent parent and caregiver reports over time of a reduction in toxic stress and relief  from trauma among children, parents and caregivers as a result of the play-based teaching and learning with  both ECD kit interventions. ",2184
positive,Children reportedly grew in their social emotional skills and cognitive development through play with the ECD  kit and locally made toys. ,2185
positive,"Parents reported playing with their children more often at home after the toymaking took place, including  fathers. ",2186
neutral," Evaluation Question 2: How and to what extent did the ECD kit interventions align with UNICEF’s strategic and  country program plans, government policies, standards and priorities expressed in national ECD/sectoral plans  and the sustainable development goals? ",2187
positive,Both the foundational and enhanced ECD kit interventions were well aligned with UNICEF’s country  programme plans and provided an entry point for UNICEF to address the needs of young children.,2188
positive,The kits  enriched the learning environments of ECD centres and child friendly spaces and demonstrated to caregivers  and parents the importance of early learning and stimulation through play. ,2189
positive,Both the foundational and enhanced ECD kit interventions were well aligned with government policies and  priorities for early childhood at a national level. ,2190
positive,"Play-based teaching and learning is highly valued by the  Government of Uganda, and the ECD kit interventions helped to support this approach to young children’s  development. ",2191
positive,"There was a high need for play materials in ECD centres within Uganda on a national level,  according to national ECD managers and trainers. ",2192
positive,"The ECD kit interventions were well positioned at the time of the crisis in South Sudan due to the strong  enabling environment for ECD in Uganda, including a national ECD policy, quality guidelines for ECD centres  in emergency settings, and early learning and development standards for children ages 3 to 6.",2193
negative,"However, the overcrowded conditions and the caregiver-to-child ratio (1:50 to 1:250) far exceeded  government guidelines (1:20), especially during surge conditions.",2194
negative,"While outside the scope of this evaluation,  the data indicates that this ECD centre guideline was not followed in practice, which created challenges in  play affordances, opportunities and experiences over time with the ECD kits. ",2195
neutral,Evaluation Question 3: What were the mechanism and processes through which the ECD kit ‘foundational’ and  ‘enhanced’ interventions were effective? ,2196
neutral,"The extent to which the ECD kit interventions were effective depended upon the degree to which the toys and  learning materials were integrated into existing programmes for young children, which varied by:  o the phase of emergency response and recovery; o the affordances for play provided in each ECD centre over time; and o caregiver exposure to the Community Child Care Programme and, in particular, their participation in  local toymaking (the enhanced ECD kit intervention) ",2197
neutral,"The adoption (or frequent use) of the ECD kits initially varied by delivery model (ECD centres focus tended to  use the toys for cognitive development, while child friendly spaces tended to use the toys for social emotional  learning) ",2198
neutral,Other factors that shaped the adoption (or frequent use of) the ECD kits included:  o access and storage of the toys and learning materials;  o caregiver capacities to use the toys and learning materials with large numbers of children in  classrooms; and  o the type of play experiences promoted by the caregivers. ,2199
neutral,Evaluation Question 4: How effective were the adult capacity development approaches used in the ‘foundational’  and ‘enhanced’ ECD kit intervention with regards to the desired outcomes and impacts? ,2200
negative,There were no notable differences observed in caregiver capacities to use the toys between the foundational  and enhanced ECD Kit interventions until a majority of the caregivers were exposed to the Community Child  Care Programme and the toymaking was fully implemented. ,2201
negative,"Caregivers received no direct training on the toys and materials in the foundational ECD kit intervention and  instead relied upon intuition and experience to use them, which varied by level of previous teaching  experience. ",2202
negative,"Caregivers became more aware of the importance of early childhood and best practices for programming  through the national, standardized ECD training (the Enhanced ECD kit intervention); however, their  capacities in play-based learning did not improve until they participated in making and using local toys.",2203
neutral,Evaluation Question 5: How have UNICEF and its partners adapted or added to the standard kit to make them  more sustainable in actual practice? ,2204
positive,The toymaking innovation was designed to increase the number of play materials in the centres and to  engage parents in supporting play and ECD. ,2205
positive,Hundreds of parents were involved in making replica ECD kit toys and traditional toys that drew upon their  own play experiences and cultural traditions as well as locally available materials to ensure sustainability. ,2206
positive,"The toymaking process involved the adaptation of the most popular toys within the ECD kit (such as the  shape sorter and puppets), using the kit as a model or guide for reproduction. ",2207
positive,"Caregivers and parents learned more about how each toy was designed to support children’s learning and  development at different ages, using the information contained in the ECD Kit Activity Guide. ",2208
neutral,Evaluation Question 6: What changes in caregiver interactions with children and the use of the ECD kit for  learning and development were observed as a result of the ‘foundational’ versus the ‘enhanced’ ECD kit  interventions? ,2209
negative,There were no notable differences observed in caregiver interactions with children between the foundational  and enhanced ECD kit interventions until the toymaking was fully implemented. ,2210
positive,"Because of the increased access to local toys, caregivers were observed transforming their interactions with  children from rote teaching with the toys, to a more child-centered approached based upon guided learning  through play. ",2211
positive,"This transformation in caregiver capacities was also possible because they were exposed to the Community  Child Care Programme and because each child had access to a toy either individually or in small groups,  which increased their overall engagement in play activities. ",2212
neutral,"Evaluation Question 7: How did changes in caregiver outcomes vary among different sub-groups, such as  parents, preschool teachers, ECD practitioners, and community members? ",2213
positive,Caregivers attributed playing with children to helping them overcome their own trauma and provided them  with a source of stress relief during both the foundational and enhanced ECD kit interventions. ,2214
positive,"Caregivers and parents from different cultural and tribal backgrounds bonded over the local toymaking  process, which contributed to benefits in community cohesion and integration within the settlement.",2215
positive,"Parents reported playing with their children more often at home because of the toymaking innovation, which  contributed to more positive discipline approaches and to their nurturing care. ",2216
positive,"The local toymaking innovation engaged fathers in playing with their children, which has previously been  considered outside of cultural norms. ",2217
neutral,"Evaluation Question 8: How and to what extent did the ECD kit interventions contribute to children’s psychosocial  well-being, early learning and developmental outcomes? ",2218
positive,"Both of the ECD kit interventions contributed to changes in child outcomes, as reported by caregivers and  parents.",2219
negative,"However, it is difficult with existing data to isolate any differences from these approaches on specific  child outcomes. ",2220
positive,"Both the interventions contributed to changes in children’s language development and developing  mathematical concepts, such as colors, shapes and counting. ",2221
positive,"Children’s social emotional learning and development were also enhanced by both interventions, but  especially through the use of local toys. ",2222
positive,Relating to others was a significant theme that steadily expanded  across the time periods.,2223
positive,"Children were described as building confidence and basic social skills as a result of  their play experiences, including consistent reports by caregivers and parents that they were fighting less,  making new friends, sharing their toys, and building confidence at the sites with full implementation. ",2224
positive,"Caregiver and parent reports of children’s recovery from trauma and stress reduction were significant themes  at time 1 and 2, and diminished over time 3, but reflect the importance of play in reducing toxic stress in  children. ",2225
neutral,"Evaluation Question 9: How did these outcomes vary for girls and boys of different ages and backgrounds, as  relevant to the country context?",2226
neutral,"Though caregivers offered the same play opportunities to both boys and girls, there were differences during  free play times across all time periods.",2227
neutral,"Girls tended to play more with dolls and puppets, while boys tended to  play with locally made balls, blocks, and model cars.",2228
neutral,"Younger children (aged 3-4) played with shape sorters and wooden beads more often, while older children  (aged 5-6) played with stacking cups and card books more often.",2229
positive,"However, there were no reported or observable differences between the outcomes girls and boys received  from playing. ",2230
positive,"Ugandan and South Sudanese refugee children equally benefited from the ECD kit toys and learning  materials, indicating their inclusive use in practice. ",2231
positive,The primary lessons learned through the evaluation included the following:  ● The hands-on toymaking is especially effective in bringing alive the concepts of learning through play  explained in the earlier sessions of the enhanced ECD kit intervention and led to better adoption of play- based learning practices by both caregivers and parents. ,2232
positive,"Given the overcrowded conditions, an infusion of ECD kits at time 2 to better match UNICEF standards (1 kit  for every 50 children) did not contribute to any observable differences in the way the toys were used by  caregivers and children in the classroom. ",2233
positive,The transformation in caregiver capacities and interactions with children from rote teaching to play-based  learning and engagement was related to their better understanding of the toys and learning materials after  they were involved in replicating the ECD kit toys. ,2234
positive,Including parents own play experiences and traditional forms of play contributed to the success of the  toymaking innovation. ,2235
positive,Working towards a common goal such as the toymaking promoted social cohesion across cultural differences  with the settlement.,2236
positive,"Conclusion 1: Relevance to National ECD Context – Both ECD kit interventions were appropriate for the  Uganda country context, as well as the emergency context.",2237
positive,"Play-based teaching and learning is highly valued by  the Government of Uganda, and the ECD kit interventions helped to support this approach to young children’s  development. ",2238
neutral,The enabling environment that existed for early childhood prior to the emergency contributed to the  ability of the Ugandan Government to respond to the needs of young children in the Bibidibi refugee settlement. ,2239
negative,"However, the overcrowding of classrooms and the caregiver-to-child ratio far exceeded government guidelines  during surge conditions and remained a persistent challenge to play affordances and experiences over time with  the ECD kits. ",2240
positive,"Conclusion 2: Relevance to UNICEF Country Programming – Both ECD kit interventions, and especially the  local toymaking innovation, were relevant for UNICEF’s equity agenda and its objectives for ECD programming in  the country.",2241
positive,"UNICEF reached highly vulnerable women and children through these interventions, including  unaccompanied children providing care for their younger siblings. ",2242
positive,"The findings indicate a reduction in toxic stress  and relief from trauma among children, parents and caregivers as a result of the play-based teaching and learning  with the ECD kits, and especially the when the enhanced training and local toymaking innovation was fully  implemented.",2243
positive,Children also grew in their social emotional skills and cognitive development through play with the  ECD kits and locally made toys.,2244
positive,"Parents reported playing with their children more often at home after the  toymaking took place, including fathers. ",2245
negative,Conclusion 3: Effectiveness of the Foundational ECD Kit Intervention – The foundation ECD kit intervention  was limited in its effectiveness in terms of leveraging the ECD kits for play-based teaching and learning.,2246
positive,"The  foundational ECD kit intervention enriched the learning environment of the ECD centres in the Bidibidi refugee  settlement, and served as an important entry point for UNICEF to stimulate and support ECD programming. ",2247
negative," Thus, some  13  child development outcomes were reported after the foundational ECD kit intervention took place, but they were  limited in scope and variety (primary stress reduction, counting and language development).  ",2248
negative,"Conclusion 4: Effectiveness of the Enhanced ECD Kit Intervention – The effectiveness of the enhanced ECD  kit intervention took time to observe in practice given the devolution of the national training on the district level  was not fully implemented until the third evaluation field visit, and not all caregivers received this training.",2249
negative,"While  the standardized national ECD training (the enhanced ECD kit intervention) gave caregivers new teaching  strategies and improved their overall understanding of early childhood development and the importance of play- based teaching, there were largely no observable differences in caregiver capacities to implement play-based  teaching until the local toymaking innovation took place.",2250
neutral,"In other words, the transformation in caregiver practices  appear to be strongly associated with the local toymaking dimension of the enhanced ECD kit intervention. ",2251
positive,"The  toymaking also helped parents to support play-based learning at home, which created a continuum of learning  between children’s home environment and the ECD centres.",2252
positive,"Children’s social emotional learning was particularly  affected by the enhanced ECD kit intervention, and especially when the local toymaking took place.",2253
positive,"Children were  observed fighting less with their peers, and developing positive social skills such as sharing. ",2254
positive,Some parents also  reported children’s motivation to attend the ECD programme increased after the local toymaking took place. ,2255

neutral,Over 75 percent of evaluations were commissioned at the country level and were national  in scope across 2016 - 2018. ,2282
neutral,Over three fourths of all evaluations were managed  exclusively by UNICEF while the percentage of evaluations jointly managed with other UN  organisation remained static across 2016 - 2018 at only 2 percent. ,2283
positive,"As Exhibit A indicates, the average quality of UNICEF evaluation reports was considered  as satisfactory across the three-year period and improved by 6 percent from 2.75 in 2016  to 2.99 in 2018, with the average report quality reaching the verge of entering the upper  satisfactory category in 2018.",2284
positive,"If these consistent trends in improvement continue,  UNICEF should expect to cross the upper satisfactory threshold of 3.0 in 2019.",2285
positive,"As shown in Exhibit B, the percentage of evaluation reports per year rated as satisfactory  or higher increased by nearly 14 percent from 73.5 percent in 2016 to 87.4 percent in  2018. ",2286

positive,"While 2016  produced one unsatisfactory report, no evaluations were rated as unsatisfactory in 2017  or 2018.",2288
positive,The percentage of evaluations in the upper satisfactory and upper fair categories  has also increased across the years.,2289
positive,"These trends represent overall continuous  improvement in UNICEF evaluation report quality, therefore increasing the reliability of  evaluative evidence for UNICEF decision-making. ",2290
positive,"In 2018, the average evaluation report score in each region was above the satisfactory  threshold of 2.5. ",2291
positive,"As seen in Exhibit C, the East Asia and Pacific Region (EAPR) produced  the highest quality evaluation reports in 2018 with an average score of 3.36 followed by  the Europe and Central Asia Region (ECAR) with an average score of 3.13. ",2292
negative,The Eastern  and Southern Africa Region (ESAR) and the Regional Office of South Asia (ROSA) were  the regions with the lowest 2018 scores with a score of 2.76 and 2.73 respectively.,2293
positive,A three-year cross annual trend analysis confirms that the quality of evaluation reports  has been increasing overall between 2016 and 2018 for all regions with the exception of  ROSA.,2294
positive,ESAR experienced the most significant overall improvement with an increase in  score of 9.3 percent followed by EAPR with an increase in score of 8.3 percent. ,2295
positive,"When separating reports by their SPOA Correspondence, evaluation reports across  thematic areas are largely the same quality with only a 4.8 percent difference between the  area that scored the highest (social inclusion with a score of 3.08) and lowest (WASH with  a score of 2.89) in 2018. ",2296
positive,Evaluations focusing on cross-cutting priorities (including gender  equality and humanitarian action) scored quite high at 3.02 and 3.06 respectively. ,2297
positive,This  suggests that the GEROS rating system does not disadvantage such evaluations.,2298

positive,Strengths of the GEROS Review Tool: • It facilitates the standardization of the quality of evaluation reports across a  decentralized structure within UNICEF; • It provides a platform to monitor trends in evaluation quality across the  organisation; • Individual GEROS reviews per evaluation report provide real-time feedback with  qualitative comments and suggestions for improvement to help UNICEF evaluation  managers and evaluators improve the quality of evaluations; and • The annual Meta-Analysis informs UNICEF decision-makers in senior  management as to where to make investments to improve the quality of  evaluations. ,2309
negative,Limitations of the GEROS Review Tool: • GEROS is limited to an assessment of the evaluation report and is unable to  capture any events or processes that are not described within the report.,2310
negative,"UNICEF  evaluation managers, therefore, must ensure that all processes are clearly  described. ",2311
negative,"While rating scores are useful for monitoring trends in evaluation quality and  potentially serving as motivators for offices and regions to improve their scores,  they can also shift focus away from qualitative feedback and distract from the  learning aspect of the GEROS reviews. ",2312

negative,The current GEROS tool does not include customized assessment questions per  evaluation type.,2316
positive,"The 2018 meta-analysis noted improvements in areas where evaluation performance was  deemed weak by previous meta-analyses (areas needing improvement included  evaluation methods, lessons learned, and evaluation principles). ",2317
positive,This trend in  improvement suggests that UNICEF has made investments to improve its evaluation  quality in these particular areas and that these investments are paying off. ,2318
positive,This also  suggests that GEROS is a useful system for highlighting areas needing improvement and  for providing guidance to UNICEF decision-makers around how to facilitate improvement. ,2319
neutral,The 2018 GEROS Meta-Analysis produced four (4) over-arching conclusions and  corresponding recommendations to support UNICEF with the continued strengthening of its evaluation function and programming through the GEROS platform.,2320

negative,"Additionally, the current GEROS system is unable to capture the usefulness of evaluation  recommendations to evaluation users. ",2328
positive,"Conclusion #3 – Focus on Learning: While GEROS offers huge potential to facilitate  institutional learning, the current system is heavily focused on rating scores. ",2335
negative,"While the use  of a rating score is useful for measuring changes in evaluation quality and for incentivizing  improvements in evaluation performance, it carries the risk of shifting focus away from  learning if not paired with learning-specific activities. ",2336
neutral,"Conclusion #4 – Joint Evaluation Management with other UN Organisations: As part  of the UN Reform, UN organisations are increasingly expected to engage in more joint programming and evaluation. ",2342

negative,"The selection of candidates for recog- nition is a case-by-case decision primarily based on these documents, without proof of demonstrated results. ",2461
negative,The selection process is resource-heavy and time-consuming for UNICEF and its partners due to lack of comparability across standard indicators.,2462
negative,"As the performance of the cities does not impact the recognition process, providing the CFCI recognition is a serious reputational risk to UNICEF, with the process relying heavily on commitments and self-reporting, with insuffi- cient quality assurance mechanisms. ",2463
negative,"Currently, there is little guarantee that a UNICEF-recognized child-friendly city is delivering results for children.",2464

positive,UNESCO’s shaping of the global education priorities and the SDG4-Education 2030  Agenda is evident through a wide range of activities including: convening global  and regional meetings and dialogues; preparation of background papers and think  pieces; facilitating debate and consultation amongst member states; advising on  the formulation of the target; leading development of the monitoring framework;  producing guidance on unpacking SDG4 to support implementation by Member  States; and advising on the global coordination mechanisms/architecture needed  to support implementation. ,2772
positive,"Based on our review of a sample of UNESCO’s knowledge products, it is clear  that UNESCO’s intellectual work and advocacy made a significant contribution to  shaping the SDG4-Education 2030 Agenda and ensuring the universality of the  agenda with a clear focus on access, equity and inclusion, quality and lifelong  learning. ",2773
negative,"Despite the good work in shaping SDG4 and developing the Education 2030  Framework for Action, most interviewees agreed that momentum had not been  maintained in the post-2015 implementation phase. ",2774
negative,A commonly expressed view  was that UNESCO had not sufficiently planned for the transition from agenda- setting to coordinating implementation and monitoring progress.,2775
positive,"While primary responsibility for SDG implementation rests with Member States,  the global education community is looking to UNESCO to show leadership in  supporting Member States to translate the high-level goal and targets into concrete  policies and initiatives, and to support the development of robust monitoring  frameworks and mechanisms.",2776
negative,Key external stakeholders consider that the global and regional architecture for  supporting implementation of SDG4-Education 2030 is not functioning effectively.,2777
negative,"Some stakeholders see this situation as a major risk for the achievement of progress  against SDG4, and something that needs to be addressed with some urgency.",2778

positive,"Through its  research network, including the Category 1 Institutes, UNESCO has produced a  high volume and variety of knowledge products of relevance to Member States",2782
negative,"UNESCO’s global intellectual leadership in the field of education is a key aspect  of its comparative advantage, however a common theme highlighted throughout  this evaluation is the widespread concern, held by both external and internal  stakeholders, that its standing and capacity as a global thought leader has eroded.",2783
positive,It is therefore timely that the Sector has moved to strengthen its education foresight  and laboratory of ideas functions by initiating a sector-wide research strategy and  launching the Futures of Education global initiative. ,2784
positive,"An independent international  commission of thought-leaders from diverse fields and regions will lead this  initiative with the goal of catalysing a global consultation on how knowledge and  learning can shape the future of humanity and the planet, resulting in a landmark  report in 2021.",2785
negative,"Many stakeholders commented that UNESCO has been passive in its standard  setting role in education for a considerable period, with few new education- focused global conventions since 1989. ",2786
positive,"n this context, the development of the  General Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications, the final text of which will  be presented at the 40th Session of the UNESCO General Conference in November  2019, is a significant milestone.",2787
positive,"Throughout the evaluation period, UNESCO has also undertaken work aimed  at monitoring observance with education norms and standards, bringing  much needed transparency to important issues of equity and inclusion, while  simultaneously supporting Member States to improve their national legislation and  policies in compliance with international norms.",2788

positive,"UNESCO is a strong advocate for a humanistic and holistic vision of education, and  for initiatives that strengthen education systems and build capacities of Member  States to develop evidence-based policies.",2790
positive,It is a trusted advisor to Member States  and works with them to support alignment with global priorities and commitment  to international standards and norms.,2791
positive,"UNESCO’s policy advice and technical expertise are highly valued by Member  States, and there is significant demand for support, especially in relation to the  implementation of the SDG4-Education 2030 Agenda, data collection and statistical  capacity building, as well as education system and policy reform.",2792
positive,We found many good examples of UNESCO having a positive impact on education  reform and developing national capacity.,2793
negative,"However, the limited capacity of UNESCO’s  field network means it is impossible for UNESCO to meet all demands for technical  advice and support from Member States.",2794
negative,"Further, stakeholders are concerned that  UNESCO’s country-level operational work is increasingly driven by the need to raise  extra-budgetary funding to deliver small-scale projects.",2795
positive,"UNESCO is most effective at country-level when it collaborates closely with other  partners, and when mechanisms such as UN country teams are used to agree on  priorities and coordinate support.",2796

positive,"Organizational mandate, operational coverage and staff expertise support PSE ",2980
positive,The evaluation finds that many staff involved in PSE are highly passionate and committed to the  work they are doing and can clearly see and articulate the goals of the partnership.,2981
positive,"These  individuals tend to have previous experience working with/in the private sector, are innovative in  their approach to operational programming, understand their political economic context, have a  5 UNHCR strong sense of what will work to achieve their goal and know also how to partner with other  stakeholders, such as national and local government bodies.",2982
positive,"In practice, UNHCR already has a  whole-of-organization approach to PSE. ",2983
positive,"Moreover, UNHCR has expertise in partnering with the many different types of stakeholders  promoted in the Global Compact on Refugees (GCR), including government, NGOs, civil society  organizations, multilateral organizations and international financial institutions (IFIs). ",2984
positive,"Private sector actors currently partnering with UNHCR expressed their interest in UNHCR’s  unique mandate, positive organizational reputation and understanding of the situation of those  forcibly displaced and the environments they live in. ",2985
negative,The annual planning cycle was reported as a challenge for designing longer-term interventions  and targeting higher-level impact outcomes desired by private sector actors.,2986
negative,The budgeting  framework was also perceived by UNHCR staff as a challenge because the tendency is to  prioritize activities that the organization is directly implementing.,2987
neutral,"In contrast, PSEs tend to involve  collective actions by the private sector and other partners, and UNHCR’s role is convening or  coordinating between actors.",2988
negative,It is sometimes challenging for staff to justify time and resources to  support these types of effort under the current framework.,2989
negative,UNHCR’s current Results-based  Management (RBM) system that supports the organization’s planning and reporting was found to  also have limitations in being able to capture and record operational engagements with the  private sector and corresponding results from partnering.,2990
negative,Current changes to the RBM system  that are under way will address the issue of recording partnership outcomes but leave other  recording and measurement issues unresolved. ,2991
neutral,Technical guidance and capacity-building resources related to PSE on operational activities were  the most cited requests for support from staff working in Regional Bureaux and country  operations.,2992
negative,"Specific areas that are found to be challenging include the development of value  propositions in negotiation with partners, negotiation skills, selecting the appropriate partners and  partnership type, and managing partnerships.",2993
negative,Formal and informal spaces for sharing and  learning across teams and operations on how others engage with the private sector are limited.,2994
negative,"Based on the stocktake, the evaluation finds that managerial support for PSE varies within the  organization.",2995
negative,Low managerial and senior management support creates disincentives for staff to  seek out partnerships with private sector actors. ,2996
negative,UNHCR’s whole-of-organization approach to  PSE is not uniformly supported either in strategy or managerially.,2997
positive,"The evaluation notes that in practice, UNHCR works with all stakeholders that the GCR identifies  as being critical to a whole-of-society approach.",2998
negative,"However, these engagements are organized at  HQs in a siloed way according to the type of partner; i.e. different divisions and teams tend to  manage partnerships with one sector.",2999
negative,These teams do not regularly interact with one another to share best  practices or harmonize partnering processes.,3000
positive,"More recent efforts have been made to foster  linkages across the various organizational silos for other purposes (e.g. protection or  programming), which the evaluation notes as a positive trend and recommends that this model  should be used also for partnering.",3001

positive,"The evaluation notes that in the literature, benchmarking and stocktake partnering with the private  sector can include both financial contributions as well as operational partnership.",3003
neutral,"Partnering can  evolve, for example, with an operational goal in mind and at a later point lead to financial  contributions to UNHCR and/or other partners and vice versa.",3004
negative,"Financial contributions may not  always go to UNHCR, especially with the whole-of-society approach and UNHCR’s role as the  convener/catalyst versus implementer.",3005
negative,It was not clear from the evaluation whether such cases  would count towards PSP’s $1 billion fundraising target or to regional or national targets.,3006

neutral,These latter two possibilities should not be cut off in order to prioritize PSP’s $1 billion target.,3008
neutral,What is appropriate to the decentralized goal and partnership should be prioritized.,3009
negative,"Regardless, based on the literature and benchmarking, a helpful process appears to follow these  steps: (a) define the impact goal; (b) identify the stakeholders that could contribute (from the  public and/or private sector); and (c) negotiate the partnership type suited to achieving this aim.

neutral,"Rather, they are to be used to derive  learning about UNHCR’s practices in varying contexts, which may be applicable to other operations  with similar characteristics. ",3100
positive,The evaluation notes that UNHCR has a plethora of data management systems in play for its  operational data.,3101
positive,"This includes rich and meaningful data collected on persons of concern, their  protection risks, services and assistance provided to them, and their access to solutions, socioeconomic  improvements in their lives, and the contexts in which they live. ",3102
neutral,"Data is collected, stored, analysed and shared within UNHCR through registration systems, sector- specific monitoring tools, assessments, and population databases.",3103
negative,"However, much of this data is  collected in siloed systems, and data exchange, sharing, and pooling across these systems has not yet  been done consistently.",3104
negative,"As a result, UNHCR is data rich, but the organization does not fully optimise  this data by bringing together the different types collected to perform deeper analysis at either the  operational level or at the organizational level.",3105
neutral,"Based on the three case studies and information gathered globally, some consistent themes have  emerged on UNHCR’s current approaches to data and information management.",3106
neutral,"These are  summarized below, with additional detail in the findings section of the report. ",3107
neutral,Much of UNHCR’s work is currently undertaken by partners.,3108
negative,Implementing partner data on monitoring  and results could be better integrated.,3109
neutral,"Partner monitoring frameworks and indicators are agreed when  partner agreements are signed, and partners are expected to report against such indicators periodically  (e.g. every month or every quarter).",3110
negative,"However, the data collected by partners are not always  standardized by UNHCR.",3111
negative,"Therefore, it is not always feasible nor possible to aggregate the data at  country, regional and global levels as a result of the lack of standardized indicators and indicator  definitions.",3112
negative,UNHCR also currently has no global system to enable the transfer and storing of raw data  of programme monitoring and assessment data.,3113
negative,"There are some operations that have developed  platforms or tools to enable partner reporting with a greater degree of automation, but there is yet to be  an organization-wide system. ",3114
neutral,"Registration data, for those situations where UNHCR undertakes registration, is maintained in a  standardised system. ",3115
neutral,This evaluation did not look at this system in depth.,3116
neutral,"A new version of the  registration system, Progres v4, is being rolled out across the organization.",3117
negative,"However, many  governments undertake registration themsleves, and their systems may or may not always be  compatible or shared with UNHCR. ",3118
negative,"As a result, UNHCR currently holds registration data on a fraction  of persons of concern.",3119
negative,"Protection monitoring data and case management data does exist in all  operations, however the capture and storage of this may include paper forms, MS Excel sheets and  MS Word documents. ",3120
neutral,UNHCR operations regularly undertake assessments. ,3121
neutral,Participatory assessments are undertaken  annually in many operations.,3122
neutral,"Age, gender, diversity assessments are also to be undertaken regularly.",3123
positive,"These assessments provide in-depth data and information on needs, vulnerabilities and priorities for  persons of concern.",3124
negative,"There is, to the knowledge of the evaluation, no sampling methodology or frame to  ensure that these assessments are undertaken in a rigorous manner.",3125
negative,"There is no common platform to  collect, store, share and analyse assessment data. ",3126
negative,Data are inconsistent and of variable quality.,3127
positive,Data quality was noticeably better when there was greater  use of the data by partners and UNHCR,3128
negative,"Data collection, storage and sharing at the operational level generally could be more efficient.",3129
negative,"Paper remains a common data collection methodology across the  global operation, and systems for storing and sharing information are used inconsistently, or developed  for specific operations by staff.",3130
negative,"Finally, the evaluation observed a dearth of dashboards or standard  data products used at a management level to inform decision making or to provide an immediate  understanding of the health of operations.",3131
negative,"While most UNHCR staff and partners are fully committed to protecting information about persons of  concern, and while there is a strong framework for data protection (including data security and data  sharing), the evaluation still found several instances where personal data was transferred using email  and other channels which were not secure and information-sharing processes that are vulnerable to  attack and/or security breaches.",3132
negative,"At the same time, aggregated data could be better used for  accountability to affected persons.",3133
negative,Data collected on persons of concern are not always shared back  with communities.,3134
negative,"The evaluation team observed gaps in the fulfilment of sharing data and findings with  persons of concern, especially after participatory assessments, needs assessments and routine  monitoring.",3135
neutral," The key underlying factors that affect the currrent situation are complex and, as mentioned above, the  organization recognizes that there is a need to transform the data and information management  systems.",3136
positive,There are a number of initiatives already in place that will address some of the key issues  7 UNHCR  mentioned above.,3137
positive,"These are commendable, and will benefit from ensuring that the factors mentioned  below are also considered when planning and implementing this data transformation.",3138
neutral,The current approach to data and information management is highly decentralised,3139
neutral,"UNHCR, like many large and complex organizations operating in rapidly changing and highly varied  contexts, has a highly decentralised approach to data and information management.",3140
positive,It also has many  technical specialists across the organization in protection and solutions.,3141
neutral,"Each operation, and each  technical area requires a significant amount of data and information for operational decision-making  and for global analysis and reporting. ",3142
negative,"UNHCR does not currently have a data governance policy and  structure that provides a “rule book”, for staff and partners around data standards that can bring some  consistency and coherence across these areas and operations.",3143
negative,UNHCR does not enforce global  guidelines for data management.,3144
negative,"UNHCR does not currently maintain a global library, or standard set,  of data collection tools that can be accessed and used by country and field offices.",3145
negative,The evaluation finds  that UNHCR staff rely on personal networks for the dissemination and discovery of tools and resources.,3146
negative,Some sectors do provide global guidance but up-take and application by operations is not mandatory. ,3147
negative,"As a result, there is evidence of duplication of effort in some instances, and evidence of inefficient and  poor quality data management practices. ",3148
negative,There needs to be a higher investment in data science and information management capacities ,3149
negative,The organization does not adequately prioritize data management as a function at the country and  regional levels.,3150
negative,"Currently, data science and information management are not seen as core functions of  country and regional offices.",3151
negative,"Consequently, there are operations without any data scientists or  information management officers (IMO).",3152

negative,"Very rarely, will an operation have multiple staff,  specialising with expertise in data analysis, data management, statistical methods, geographic  information system (GIS) mapping and information technology.",3154
negative,"n many cases, operations have only  one or two IMOs, who are not specialised in all of the aforementioned areas.",3155
negative,"At the regional and  headquarters levels, the breadth and depth of expertise in statistics, data analysis, data management  and data integration could be improved.",3156
negative,Data sharing and data integration has not been adequately emphasized,3157
negative,There are limited data sharing platforms being used and information management teams often focus  primarily on inter-agency clusters/working groups and are not tapped into by the rest of the operation. ,3158
positive,Positive shifts are already underway.,3159
positive,UNHCR’s Microdata Library and the creation of the Joint Data  Centre in cooperation with the World Bank signal the organization’s leadership and commitment to not  only strengthening data on populations affected by forced displacement but also sharing it with the  public.,3160
positive,"There are also emerging good practices in the establishment of an integrated data service unit in the Middle East and North Africa region, population-level risk and vulnerability assessments that are  inter-agency and coordinated with national governments, and inter-agency research agendas and  growing collaborations with research universities and institutes to address knowledge and evidence  gaps. ",3161
neutral,Such efforts need to be expanded and institutionalised.,3162
negative,"There needs to be a far deeper understanding about data protection and data access, especially  personal data",3163
negative,"The evaluation finds that much more can be done to ensure that personal data collected from persons  of concern is anonymised before sharing, and that other types of data, such as aggregated data about  needs and vulnerabilities, could be more easily accessible. ",3164
negative,The organization receives a number of data  sharing requests from implementing and operational partners.,3165
negative,Country operations spend a significant  amount of time and energy reviewing these requests per the data protection due diligence process.,3166
negative,"This process can take up to several months, causing delays to activities and frustrations with partners.",3167
neutral,Breaking information silos requires leveraging technology and changing gatekeeping behaviours,3168
positive,"As mentioned earlier, the evaluation observes that UNHCR collects/collates a wide volume of data from  needs assessments, community-based participatory assessments, vulnerability assessments,  protection monitoring (case management), assistance monitoring and other special surveys (e.g.  sector-specific and protection-related surveys). ",3169
negative,"Without centralised data repositories at country,  regional and global levels, the data remain sitting in the thematic area in which they were collected/collated.",3170
neutral,There currently exist technological solutions that UNHCR could apply to pull data  from disparate datasystems without having to migrate data into one system.,3171
negative,"However, the culture  around sharing one’s data with other functional teams has been noted to be challenging at all levels  within UNHCR. ",3172
negative,"The lack of visibility of what data are available along with difficulties in accessing the  data, limit UNHCR’s ability to have a comprehensive understanding of the current and historical state  of refugees and other persons of concern.",3173
neutral,The value proposition for UNHCR to make significant investments in data and IM is clear.,3174
negative,"The evaluation finds that UNHCR urgently wants, and needs, better quality and more coherent data  and analysis to make better strategic decisions, operational decisions, and show its results and  performance to stakeholders; • It also notes that UNHCR is currently missing opportunities to use data and analysis in advocacy  with states, especially when forced displacement discourses are politicised; and • Finally, as the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR ought to be an authority on what is happening with  refugees and other persons of concern, but this authority is being eroded by other players who are  presenting and sharing data and information that is sometimes more compelling and interesting  than UNHCR’s data.",3175
neutral,Benchmarking efforts with other organizations have shown their prioritization  of improvements in data and information management. ,3176
positive,"Based on this evaluation, the gap between what UNHCR wants and where it currently is not that  stark.",3177
positive,"There are some straightforward, and not-so-difficult fixes that can help UNHCR become more  efficient and have more aggregated data visualized and accessible.",3178
negative," In particular, prioritizing some  investments in data integration, data capacities and data norms and standards could be very helpful.",3179
negative,"UNHCR has some excellent data/IM practices and some great capacity, but this is often only seen  in a few places and for a few operations.",3180
negative,There is a need to institutionalise these good practices. ,3181
neutral,"Many factors influence why UNHCR cannot get a comprehensive sense of what difference its  efforts are making with its resources at any level, usually not even at a camp or a settlement or a  local area level, let alone at the country operation, regional, or global levels.",3182
negative," In particular, data  governance (rule book and parameters) and clear and empowered leadership need strengthening. ",3183
negative,"The longer-term vision, where data become a strategic asset for UNHCR, needs to be supported by  the development of a costed, sequenced and thoughtful roadmap and strategy.",3184
negative, Rushing into  expensive systems solutions without a roadmap will lose time and money in the long run.,3185
neutral,"In the context of UNHCR’s current data and information systems, the internal and external changes it is facing,  and the needs required to act as a leader on protection and solutions, the evaluation offers the following  recommendations, with additional detail and sub-recommendations in the main body of the report: ",3186
neutral,This Think Piece is part of an ongoing learning and strategic evaluation exploring UNHCR’s engagement in  humanitarian-development cooperation.,3207
neutral,The evaluation began in 2018 and will conclude in 2021.,3208
neutral,"It investigates the scope of cooperation, the factors and measures influencing cooperation, and the effects on persons of concern,  UNHCR, and its partners. ",3209
positive,"Evidence, collected primarily through four country case studies, suggests that UNHCR has considerably  increased its engagement in humanitarian-development cooperation.",3210
positive,"Not only is there a shift in mind-set, with  UNHCR staff across hierarchies and locations buying into the agenda; there are also diverse examples of practice. ",3211
positive,"With host governments defining how much space there is for cooperation, UNHCR mainly engages in  humanitarian-development cooperation in four ways: by providing different kinds of support to development actors  in order to catalyze their engagement on forced displacement (type 1); by leveraging the influence of development  actors for advocacy on host government policies (type 2); by gradually linking services to national or local systems  (type 3); and by mobilizing development resources to expand UNHCR’s work on self-reliance (type 4).",3212
positive,"While existing practice in the case-study countries shows diverse engagement across these types, the  predominant narrative within UNHCR centers on being a “facilitator” and a “catalyst” for other actors. ",3213
neutral,"Accordingly, organizational investments have also focused on UNHCR’s role as a catalyst and facilitator. ",3214
positive,"There  are, however, examples of important other forms of cooperation and widespread perceptions that additional  opportunities for cooperation exist, particularly with regard to linking services to national systems.",3215
neutral,Opinions are  diverging on whether UNHCR should seek funds from development actors to increasingly deliver on self-reliance  itself.,3216
negative,"In its role as a “catalyst”, UNHCR is not always able to meet the demands of development actors – for  instance, for data and operational protection advice.",3217
positive,"In particular, UNHCR should continue its efforts to expand  its collection and analysis of data on the socio-economic situations of refugees and provide more practical advice  on how to integrate protection into programming. ",3218
neutral,The effects of this increasing engagement are still emerging.,3219
positive,"In the vast majority of cases, the evidence is  positive – not only for refugees and other people of concern, but also for UNHCR and its partners.",3220
positive,"Successful cases regarding advocacy cooperation, for example the new Ethiopian Refugee Proclamation, are expected to  have positive effects on the protection of refugees and on their socio-economic situations.",3221
positive,"Service  integration appears to reduce the cost of providing services, despite existing concerns that it may lead to a decline  in service quality and reliability. ",3222
positive,"When it comes to expanding work on self-reliance with funds from development  actors, the evaluation found only a small number of programs which, however, have high visibility within UNHCR as  well as among its partners and host governments.",3223
negative,"Despite these indications of positive effects, current experience also suggests that the potential of UNHCR’s  engagement in humanitarian-development cooperation is less transformational than may have been  expected.",3224
negative,"First, UNHCR’s leverage in influencing the strategic orientation of key development actors towards  forced displacement may be limited or dependent on the broader operational and policy context.",3225
negative,"Second, even  where development actors engage, refugees and other persons of concern will require continued operational  support from UNHCR for many areas.",3226
negative," Thus, in cases in which service integration has been achieved, handing over  implementation to development actors has not meant handing over financial responsibilities.",3227
negative,"Third, some of  UNHCR’s internal obstacles to maximizing cooperation with development actors are difficult to address and/or  entail trade-offs.",3228
neutral,"In particular, this concerns the internal system for allocating resources as well as the effects of  short planning cycles on effective alignment with longer-term planning processes.",3229
neutral,"Finally, there are open questions  as to the level of advocacy commitment of international development actors, as well as on whether their early  engagement represents a fundamental shift in their ways of working.",3230
positive,"As a protection and solutions agency, UNHCR has invested significantly over recent years in its ability to cooperate  with development actors.",3231
positive,"Many of these investments - for example in data and analysis, as well as development  expertise among staff - have focused on UNHCR’s role as a catalyst.",3232
negative,"Evidence collected to date for this evaluation  suggests that further adaptations, which would also support other types of cooperation, may be necessary. ",3233
neutral,"This report presents the findings of a review of UNHCR’s policies and procedures to protect refugees, returnees,  stateless people, internally displaced people and asylum-seekers (UNHCR’s ‘persons of concern’1 ) from sexual  exploitation and abuse by humanitarian actors (PSEA).",3241
neutral," It is intended to be a ‘light touch’ evaluative review of  UNHCR’s current policies and procedures on PSEA, and how they are being interpreted and implemented in  practice.",3242

neutral,"UNHCR’s policies and procedures on PSEA are evolving and  adapting as the agency seeks to strengthen its approach to prevention and response, so this should also be seen as  a stock-take of a system in motion.",3244
neutral,"UNHCR seeks to provide ‘a trusted, respectful and inclusive environment where the people we serve and those who  work for the organization feel safe, heard, equipped and empowered to speak up for themselves and others and to  take robust and visible action, as appropriate, to eradicate sexual exploitation and abuse as well as sexual  harassment.’",3245
positive,"UNHCR’s commitment on PSEA has been implemented since 2002 through a series of measures  relating to awareness-raising, reporting, investigations, disciplinary action and survivor and whistle-blowing  protection. ",3246
positive,"The past year has seen a very noticeable ‘step change in [UNHCR’s] approach and engagement’3 on  PSEA, driven by UNHCR leadership and clearly strengthening the agency’s pre-existing commitment to eradicating  sexual exploitation and abuse.",3247
neutral,Since 2009 the intention of the agency has been to ‘mainstream’ PSEA in UNHCR operations.,3248
positive,The review finds that  this intention has been partially successful.,3249
negative,"However PSEA governance, and staff and management responsibilities  and accountabilities on PSEA are not yet as clear as they need to be to ensure effective mainstreaming. ",3250
negative,"On a day- to-day basis, much of the responsibility for PSEA has been delegated to 300 PSEA Focal Points, representing less  than 2 per cent of the agency’s total workforce.",3251
negative,"UNHCR staff are working with persons of concern to raise  awareness and assess the risk of sexual exploitation and abuse, but it is not clear how consistently or systematically PSEA is being integrated into the agency’s day-to-day work with persons of concern.",3252
positive,"The agency is proactive in encouraging staff to report concerns regarding sexual exploitation and abuse, and the  increase in numbers of reports received suggest these efforts may be paying off.",3253
negative,"However, feedback from both  staff and persons of concern confirm that barriers to reporting still exist.",3254
negative,"UNHCR prioritises the investigation of  complaints of sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA), and is making efforts to strengthen investigations and  disciplinary outcomes on SEA cases, but a number of operational challenges remain, including the resourcing of  investigations.",3255
neutral,"UNHCR’s 2018 strategy and action plan on sexual misconduct makes clear that sexual exploitation and abuse of  persons of concern is a betrayal of the agency’s protection mandate, and that the elimination of SEA requires  changes in both individual behaviour, and agency culture. ",3256
positive,The review finds that some elements of effective culture  change are in place. ,3257
positive,It also finds that significant amounts of agency effort have been focused on individual  behaviour change particularly around staff reporting. ,3258
negative,However there is more to do in both areas in order to make  further progress.,3259
negative,"The review also finds that whilst PSEA is clearly understood by the agency as a protection risk,  this understanding is not currently translating on a consistent, day-to-day basis into the implementation of PSEA as  a protection priority. ",3260

neutral,"To evaluate the gains from GFM, the evaluation  team compared the present situation to what it  would be if GFM had not been implemented. ",3314
neutral,The main takeaways of the comparison of the  GFM scheme to buying locally are clear. ,3315
positive,"GFM  benefits clearly outweigh its costs, considering  procurement costs, revenues from disposal,  insurance costs, and the effort of staff time  involved.",3316
positive,"Savings from procurement and  insurance and revenues from disposal have led to  an overall GFM gain of USD 17,500,000.",3317
positive,The  evaluation estimated that GFM procurement of  light vehicles saved UNHCR approximately USD  8.8 million in 2017 and approximately USD 9.5  million in 2018.,3318
positive,"While information on the revenues from disposal  of vehicles before GFM is limited, the auction  process used by GFM brought in revenues of  approximately USD 6.3 million in 2017 alone. ",3319
positive,"Regarding insurance costs, the cost of all-risk  insurance bought locally is higher than insurance  provided through GFM. ",3320
positive,"The cost is estimated to  be USD 4,635,626 for insurance bought locally,  compared to USD 2,178,500 for insurance  provided through GFM.",3321
positive," This represents savings of  USD 2,457,126.",3322
positive,"In addition to providing monetary benefits, GFM  has contributed to improving and streamlining  the ordering, management, and disposal of light  vehicles.",3323
positive, Self-insurance and standardization of  processes are also identified as important  benefits accrued through the GFM Scheme.,3324
positive,"The UNHCR vehicle self-insurance scheme  provides low cost, comprehensive insurance  coverage for damage and loss.",3325
positive,"It is a value added  for country operations, many of which only had  access to local third-party liability insurance.",3326
positive,"There have been notable increases in the number  of incidents reported, from 132 in 2014 to 463 in  2017.",3327
positive,"Additionally, the total amount of insurance  claim reimbursements increased by a  hundredfold during that same timeframe, from  USD 23,365.72 in 2014 to 2,301,850.20 in 2017.",3328
positive,"The number of claims closed without payment  also significantly decreased, from 64 percent in  2014 to 37 percent in 2017. ",3329
positive,"Overall, progress  since 2014 suggests the GFM global insurance is  working well and that continuous improvements  are being made to ensure adequate accident  reporting and efficient claims and  reimbursement processes.",3330
negative,There remain a few  areas for improvement.,3331
negative,"Notably, of the claims  closed without payment 73 percent were due to  lack of proper documentation.",3332
positive,"Another important benefit of the GFM is vehicle  standardization which increases efficiency and  reduces costs related to management, training,  maintenance and repairs because vehicles are  fitted with the same components and equipment. ",3334
positive,"Overall, GFM offers 10 models (Toyota and  Nissan) with 49 different specifications (e.g., left  or right driving, engine configuration).",3335
positive,"Initially set at 33.84 percent of the total  procurement cost, the yearly rental fee  decreased to 19 percent in 2018.",3336
positive,Staff consulted  in country operations consider the rental amount to be a fair. ,3337
neutral,"Over the five-year leasing period,  rental fees cover 95 percent of the total  procurement cost and, when combined with  revenue generated by vehicle disposal, this total  exceeds the original vehicle acquisition cost. ",3338
positive,"In  theory, this makes GFM self-sustaining. ",3339
positive,"In addition to monetary benefits accrued through  the internal rental scheme, the centralization of  the fleet management function resulted in a  more simplified and standardized procurement  process for light vehicles.",3340
positive,"This process appears to  work well overall: in general, country operations  note that the time they spend procuring vehicles  has decreased in comparison with the pre-GFM  period and that communication with GFM during  the ordering process is clear and efficient.",3341
negative,Country operations reported some confusion  about a few aspects of the process.,3342
negative,"For example,  some country staff were confused about when in  the supply chain process country operations have  to start paying rental fees.",3343
neutral,"Before the introduction of GFM, country  operations sometimes made arbitrary vehicle  disposal decisions and many vehicles were given  to government or NGO partners through a  Transfer of Ownership (ToO), or were sold at a  low price through direct sales.",3344
positive,The centralization  of light vehicle disposal has led to standardized  disposal processes across country operations and  to a reduction in ToO and direct sales.,3345
negative,"Despite  this, country operations and UNCHR partners  resist returning retired vehicles and there is a gap  of approximately 50 percent between the  number of vehicles identified for disposal and the  number turned in.",3346
negative,"Considering GFM brings in  about 1,000 new vehicles each year, and that  GFM will start disposal of GFM rental vehicles as  of 2019, closing this gap is essential.",3347
positive,"Centralized disposal has had two positive,  unexpected results.",3348
positive,"First, auctions are used to  dispose of other items such as vehicle spare parts  and office furniture and equipment.",3349
positive,"Between  2015 and 2017, revenues generated from this  new practice totalled USD 3.1 million.",3350
positive,"Second, since 2016, three UN agencies (WFP,  FAO, UNON) and international non-governmental  organizations (INGOs) have used GFM’s services  to dispose of vehicles and other assets.",3351
positive,"Through  these joint auctions, GFM generated net revenue  of USD 3.4 million for its partners.",3352
positive,"Considering  the strong desire of the UN System to work as one  and avoid duplication among UN agencies,  UNCHR’s well-defined niche in conducting public  auctions may represent an unprecedented  opportunity for UNCHR to become the go-to  agency for the disposal of vehicles across the UN  and humanitarian NGOs.",3353
positive,Another benefit of GFM is a decrease in the  average age of UNHCR’s fleet of light vehicles. ,3354
positive,"Thanks to the implementation of the disposal  policy, the average fleet age decreased from 5.22  years in 2013 to 3.86 years in 2017.",3355
negative,"However, in  2017, there was a sharp increase in the average  vehicle fleet age in Europe and Asia Pacific (AP) because, as noted above, country operations are  not disposing of vehicles according to the  disposal policy.",3356
neutral,The evaluation attempted to  verify the hypothesis that reduced fleet age leads  to a decrease in operating costs.,3357
neutral,"Data from the  Colombia operation seem to suggest that there is  a correlation, but the evaluation team lacks data  to fully confirm this hypothesis. ",3358
positive,GFM provides valuable support to country  operations and communication is generally fluid  during all steps of the vehicle procurement and  disposal processes. ,3359
negative,"However, country operation  staff did note some delays in GFM responses to  their questions and communication about  insurance claims.",3360
negative,"The evaluation found that many  country operations staff do not fully understand  the GFM rental scheme, despite information  having been disseminated and being available on  the UNHCR intranet.",3361
neutral,"Finally, an important GFM objective was to  improve the road safety awareness of UNHCR  staff and partners.",3362
positive,The evaluation found that  drivers know they are now being monitored by  the VTS and therefore have adopted safer  behaviors.,3363
positive,The VTS is also useful for emergency  alerts or to monitor partner vehicles.,3364
negative,Country  operations have not yet put in place all the  processes to effectively use the tracking system  and its data.,3365
negative,"While GFM has led to many positive changes in  the way UNHCR manages its fleet of light  vehicles, the evaluation noted concerns about  limited fleet management skills in-country and  vehicle lead time (total time between the  moment the vehicle is ordered from the  manufacturer until it is delivered to UNHCR  facilities). ",3366
negative,"Although the light vehicle disposal process  generates revenues, GFM must follow a complex  process whereby it must seek approval from  UNHCR’s Programme Budget Service (PBS) to  transfer the revenues it generates to its annual  Operating Plan budget. ",3368
negative,"GFM staff feel that this  process is complex and time consuming and that  not all revenues have been credited GFM  budgets. Between 2015 and 2017, the difference  between revenues collected by GFM and those  credited to its account represented a loss of  USD 9,883,785. ",3369
positive,"Generally, the lead time required to procure  vehicles by GFM is shorter than in the pre-GFM  period, especially in countries where local  dealerships are not available and where vehicles  had to be imported.",3370
neutral,"On average, lead time is  about six months.",3371
negative,Country operations have  expressed concern about excessive lead time and  double charges for vehicle rental.,3372
negative,"onsidering  that country operations start paying rental fees  when the Budget Transfer Form (BTF) is signed, a  country operation would need to pay rental  charges for incoming vehicles while also paying  rent for vehicles that will be disposed of when the  new vehicles arrive. ",3373
negative,Another issue hampering the full functioning of  GFM is that light vehicle management does not  appear to be an operational priority for country  operations.,3374
negative,"Although some administrators at the  HQ level are advocating for better fleet  management, the benefits and potential cost  savings are not yet clear to staff at all  organizational levels. ",3375
negative,"This was evident in the  limited resources invested in managing the fleet  and little ownership, especially at senior  management level, of the importance of fleet  management.",3376
negative,"As a result, there is no consistent  staffing structure in place and not enough  capacity to manage the fleet in-country.",3377
negative,"Although  GFM processes simplified the ordering and  disposal of vehicles, time-consuming fleet  management tasks, such as data management, have been added to the workloads of  administrative and supply officers in country  operations.",3378
negative,"In general, UNHCR fleet data management is  weak.",3379
neutral,"FleetWave, which is meant to capture  operating costs on fuel, maintenance and repairs,  has been rolled out to 45 country operations.",3380
negative,"In  the six weeks preceding 25 June 2018, only 1,110  (19 percent) of the 5,694 vehicles in participating  country operations had fuel entries, and 120 field  offices located in the operations where  FleetWave had been rolled out did not make any  fuel entries.",3381

negative,"GFM has not achieved the Fleet Strategy 2014- 2018 objective of reducing its environmental  footprint, largely because the objective was  overly ambitious.",3385
negative,"Indeed, while the majority of  UNHCR vehicles meet either the Euro 1 or 3  standard (i.e., polluting between 3 and 15 times  more than the Euro 6 standard), greener vehicles  manufactured for African and Asian markets are  simply not available. ",3386
negative,"However, the evaluation  found that GFM and country operations could do  more to ensure the use of simple eco-driving  techniques and better trip planning. ",3387
positive,"Overall, the evaluation concludes that the  benefits of GFM clearly outweigh its costs.",3388
positive,Centralizing UNHCR’s fleet management function  at headquarters has helped address important  shortcomings in the management of UNHCR’s  light vehicles.,3389
positive,"Although there remain some areas  for improvement, going back to a decentralized  model would not be a viable option.",3390
positive,Other humanitarian organizations such as the  ICRC and IFRC have shown that a centralized fleet  management model is economical and  sustainable.,3391
neutral,"Instituting such a model take time  and requires strong commitments at the highest  level of the organization, as well as significant investments to ensure the institutionalization of  strong processes and staff capacity building. ",3392

neutral,"As per the request of the Executive Board, this evaluation is a follow-up to the 2013 IEO evaluation  on UNDP’s contribution to poverty reduction (DP/2013/3). ",3530
neutral,It also examines UNDP’s programmatic  response to subsequent Executive Board deliberations and decisions that followed the 2013  evaluation.,3531
neutral,"This evaluation, however, focuses on the LDCs, a key area of UNDP support, to allow  for a deeper analysis of countries in similar economic situations where UNDP is a major provider  of support and to consider factors related to the graduation of countries from LDC status.",3532
neutral,The IEO  will be assessing UNDP programming in middle-income countries in 2019. ,3533
neutral,The evaluation assessed the contribution of country programmes and of global and regional  programmes to reducing poverty across five streams of UNDP support: inclusive growth and  employment; local economic development; sustainable livelihoods; early economic revitalization;  and Millennium Development Goal(MDG)/Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) integration. ,3534
neutral,"The  evaluation covered all LDCs in Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the Arab States and Haiti in the  Caribbean. ",3535
neutral,"For a comparative analysis, programmes in the countries that have transitioned to  middle-income status since 2010 were also included.",3536
neutral,UNDP country programmes and global and regional programmes and projects for the period 2014 to 2017 were evaluated.,3537
neutral,The assessment included the positioning of UNDP support to LDCs; the  contribution of UNDP to national poverty reduction capacity development; its convening role vis- à-vis international cooperation and United Nations efforts for sustainable development outcomes;  and the progress made by UNDP on its commitments to expand cooperation with the private sector.,3538
neutral,"The Strategic Plan 2014-2017 aimed to assist programme countries in designing and implementing development pathways that can tackle the connected issues of poverty, inequality and exclusion  while transforming productive capacities, avoiding the irreversible depletion of social and natural  capital and lowering risks arising from shocks.",3539
neutral,One of the significant changes in corporate planning  set out in that Strategic Plan was linking two separate areas of work – poverty reduction and  environmental protection – into a single area under sustainable development.,3540
positive,"While all initiatives  in the plan were meant to be pro-poor and address inequality, the ‘sustainable development  pathways’ programme area addressed this area most comprehensively. ",3541
neutral,"The Strategic Plan noted that the vision, outcomes and areas of work were relevant for all  programme countries where UNDP works, although in different combinations and with varying  degrees of emphasis. ",3542
positive,"Therefore, programme areas designed as a ‘global offer’ also enable UNDP  to adopt an issues-based – rather than a practice-based – approach to development needs and  priorities.",3543
neutral,UNDP has programmes in all 47 LDCs (including both development and conflict-affected  countries); it does not consider it essential to have an explicit strategy for LDCs since individual  country programmes respond to national contexts and priorities.,3544
neutral,"The ongoing Istanbul Programme  of Action has outlined specific tasks for some United Nations agencies, including UNDP, and most  of these tasks coincide with UNDP areas of support.",3545
neutral,"Across the seven outcomes of the Strategic Plan 2014-2017, the key streams of UNDP poverty  reduction and sustainable livelihoods programmes are the following:   Inclusive growth, employment and social protection: The UNDP strategy aimed to support the  transformation of productive capacities for income generation by strengthening human capital,  reducing economic vulnerability and building safety nets for resilience against economic and social  shocks.",3546

neutral,"Of the five programme streams assessed, economic revitalization in conflict-affected countries is  the largest area of poverty reduction followed by the sustainable livelihoods stream. ",3558
neutral,"It should be  noted that in the case of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and Green Climate Fund (GCF), the  evaluation included only projects that had a strong livelihoods component. ",3559
neutral,This section presents a summary of the evaluation’s findings across the programme themes  assessed.,3560
positive,"Although UNDP does not have a dedicated strategy around the Istanbul Programme of Action, the  thematic areas of the Strategic Plan 2014-2017 collectively seek to address the key drivers of  poverty and inequality and are relevant across programme countries, including LDCs. ",3561
neutral,"UNDP has  programmes in all 47 LDCs (31 in Africa, 12 in Asia and the Pacific, 3 in the Arab States and 1 in the  13 Caribbean).",3562

positive,"Policy engagement covered  a broad span of policies, plans and strategies directed towards pro-poor enhancement of  productive capacities and structural transformation.",3565
positive,The UNDP contribution is more evident in  creating apex institutions and strengthening institutional capacities to bridge critical functional  gaps.,3566
positive,"Government counterparts valued the ability of UNDP to respond effectively to a wide array  of institutional capacity support needs, sourcing specialist international expertise to augment staff  capacities, mobilizing multi-year donor funding for operations and commissioning analytical  studies.",3567
positive,There are several examples where UNDP contributed to the capacity development of key  institutions having direct roles in shaping pro-poor policies and actions. ,3568
negative,"While UNDP policy engagement was demand- driven and often determined by the absorption capacity of national institutions, there are areas  where UNDP could have been more proactive in informing national policies by drawing from its  community projects.",3570
positive,"UNDP led the conceptualization of the Mainstreaming, Acceleration and Policy Support (MAPS)  framework and its promotion as a United Nations system-wide tool. ",3571
positive,"UNDP facilitated multi-agency  MAPS missions in 26 countries, of which 11 are LDCs.",3572

positive,"Diagnostics were carried  out to inform policy options on the national response to the Goals, with renewed poverty  eradication commitments and targets.",3574
negative,"An issue that needs to be addressed in the conduct of the  MAPS is providing context-specific expert solutions, rather than an array of options.",3575
positive,Plans in which  the Goals have been mainstreamed have led to improved financial assessments and budgetary  allocations indexed to national targets for the Goals.,3576
neutral,Sufficient thrust on MAPS will be critical to  maintain the momentum of integrating the Goals. ,3577
neutral,"Adequate technical composition, engagement  of relevant United Nations agencies and other development actors will be critical in providing  solutions that can be adopted by countries. ",3578
positive,"Over the years, the development and promotion of indices highlighting human development and  multidimensional poverty at the global and country levels have contrbuted to policy processes. ",3579
positive,"UNDP has played an important role in advocating a multidimensional approach to poverty at the  country level, facilitating discussions on the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI).",3580
negative,Decreasing  UNDP engagement in the computation of national MPIs contrasts with its continued assistance to  governments and the compilation of national and subnational human development indices.,3581
positive,"A key  issue is UNDP’s engagement in national MPIs, which is critical for ensuring the credibility of the  MPI and follow-up with the government.",3582
neutral,UNDP positioning on indices at the country level is also  critical for its support related to the Goals.,3583
negative,"UNDP has not consolidated its efforts on global indices,  which it has built up over the years, at times conceding its work in this area.",3584
neutral,These indices assume  further importance in the Sustainable Development Goal programming context.,3585
negative,Adequate efforts  are needed for consolidating UNDP work on indices.,3586
positive,UNDP has shown a strong commitment to fostering transformative partnerships with the private  sector. ,3587
positive,"UNDP engagement has evolved from providing ad hoc support to the private sector (small- and medium-sized enterprises) in value chains and supplier development, to a more systematic  partnership strategy to harness the private sector’s potential for inclusive and sustainable growth  initiatives.",3588
positive,"UNDP engagement in policy support, programme implementation, institutional entry  points, country presence, networks and convening power have been key elements and a formidable  value proposition in attracting the private sector into inclusive market development initiatives.",3589
positive,UNDP not only facilitated public-private connections but also brought in complementary resources  to address policy and institutional bottlenecks to value enhancement for private actors while  ensuring inclusion and the beneficial participation of poorer sections of the society.,3590
positive, These are  investments that private sector actors would not undertake on their own and represented  significant and tangible benefits of partnering with UNDP.,3591
positive,"Inclusive business and markets were prioritized to integrate bottom-of-pyramid segments of the  population as consumers, suppliers, employees and business holders in value chains and markets. ",3592
negative,"However, UNDP has yet to use its comparative advantage of country presence and credibility to  scale up work in this area.",3593
negative,"UNDP value chain interventions that are scattered and small in scale  face challenges in balancing micro, meso and macro aspects and achieve limited results.",3594
negative,"Inclusive  market development initiatives need to operate at the micro (small-scale producers), meso (value  chain linkages) and macro (policy, infrastructure and incentives) levels.",3595
negative,"Also, micro, meso and  macro interventions cannot be pursued in isolation or in parallel and need to be sequenced  properly to have results.",3596
negative,These are best addressed under well-formulated and resourced sector- level strategies and action plans.,3597
positive,"Although trade support is not a major aspect of its service offering to LDCs, UNDP has contributed  to LDC efforts to build and sustain external market access. ",3599
neutral,"UNDP has channelled its trade-related  support primarily through the Enhanced Integrated Framework, the principal multilateral  mechanism for trade-related technical assistance exclusively for LDCs, as one of the six core  implementing partner agencies.",3600
negative,De-prioritization of trade-related support in UNDP since 2013 and the absence of joint approaches and insufficient efforts to build partnerships reduced the UNDP  contribution to trade-related efforts in LDCs.,3601
negative,"Lack of engagement in trade-related issues is a missed  opportunity, since LDCs are seeking assistance to become more competitive and further integrated  into regional and global markets.",3602
positive,"Governments want more hands-on support, which is not possible  for non-resident agencies, although they may be supporting countries in some areas.",3603
positive,"UNDP piloted several initiatives on financial inclusion and access to finance, with some degree of  success in integrating them into national programmes.",3604
neutral,"Access to financial services is one of the  keys to alleviating poverty and achieving sustainable economic growth, and a powerful instrument  for self-empowerment by enabling the poor, especially women, to become economic agents of  change.",3605
neutral,The UNDP livelihood portfolio includes several interventions related to financial inclusion  and access in diverse LDC settings.,3606
positive,The main interventions have been in the establishment and  strengthening of micro-finance sectors and institutional mechanisms.,3607
neutral,"Establishing linkages with  ongoing government programmes and policies is not only key to the success of community-level  access to finance initiatives, but also a requirement.",3608
negative,"UNDP was less successful in this regard in  several other countries, and even initiatives with good project-level outputs were not scaled up,  partly due to poor programme design or lack of government willingness.",3609
negative,UNDP is developing impact investment instruments and modalities with the private sector but  requires a faster pace of expansion of this area. ,3610
negative,"In the LDCs, alternative and impact financing from  the private sector, although conceptually relevant, is still on the fringe and nascent in its prospects.",3611
negative,"While there are some ongoing initiatives in the LDCs, private sector financing successes are mostly  in non-LDCs given their more mature financial sectors and capital markets. ",3612
neutral,"Unlike traditional  development finance, especially grant finance, private sector-led impact investment (also termed  blended finance, as it involves a combination of debt, equity, collateral guarantees and other forms  of financial support) seeks triple-bottom-line returns and is predicated on commercial viability  besides social and environmental outcomes.",3613
neutral,"While blended finance models have found traction in  member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and in Central  Asia and Latin America, with their well-developed financial sectors and capital markets, they are  evolving slowly in other regions, especially LDCs.",3614
neutral,"The trend is changing in Asia, but more so in  middle-income countries.",3615
positive,"UNDP is pursuing a self-sustaining model more appropriate to LDCs,  especially the use of challenge funds as incentives to de-risk private sector investment.",3616
negative,"Despite  such initiatives, at present UNDP neither has appropriate mechanisms to manage such instruments  nor is ready to embark on new and potentially risky terrain.",3617
negative,"Nevertheless, impact investment  remains a key area to address development finance constraints in LDCs and needs further  engagement, and UNDP organizational investment in this area is important.",3618
negative,"Inconsistencies remain between aspirations versus resource investments in social protection  programming, reducing the role and contribution of UNDP in this area. ",3619
neutral,"For LDCs, the key challenge  lies in the design and implementation of national social protection systems that can be financed  sustainably through an enabling fiscal space, besides highly targeted external capital.",3620
positive,"The UNDP  comparative advantage in social protection support, as perceived by development actors at the  country level, is its ability to address social protection at a cross-sectoral level compared to the  sectoral focus of other United Nations agencies, such as the International Labour Organization,  which has the lead mandate in this area.",3621
positive,"With well-established institutional networks in multiple  ministries and its convening role in post-crisis and conflict settings, UNDP is well positioned to  engage in this area.",3622
negative,Such cross-sectoral social protection efforts are not evident in the LDCs where  they are most needed.,3623
negative,Youth-related support at the country level consisted largely of stand-alone initiatives and was not  well integrated with the diverse employment and livelihood initiatives of UNDP. ,3624
negative,"Barring a few  exceptions, most youth-focused interventions remained fragmented without sufficient integration  with sectoral strategies and plans.",3625
negative,Lack of post-programme follow-up and feedback mechanisms  led to the ineffective tracking of programme outcomes and constraints.,3626
positive,"UNDP work in youth economic empowerment is predominantly at the national level through  upstream support to national policy formulation, strategies promoting youth employment, and  strengthening of information and networking platforms for youth engagement. ",3627
positive,"UNDP has piloted  youth-led social enterprises funded by impact investments such as the Youth Leadership,  Innovation and Entrepreneurship project (Youth Co:Lab).",3628
negative,"However, downstream engagements were  often small in scale and lacked integrated interventions combining policy aspects and downstream  demand-supply interventions in specific sectors or value chains.",3629
positive,Linking youth to short-term  income-generating activities has been easier in economic recovery and rehabilitation contexts  given the availability of humanitarian funding. ,3630
positive,A large share of the youth economic empowerment portfolio consists of skills development  initiatives that delivered livelihood skills training to hundreds of youth beneficiaries.,3631
negative,"Going beyond  16 the scale of such initiatives, the approach that was followed needs to be revisited, particularly in  terms of enabling linkages with sectoral initiatives.",3632
negative,"The absence of collateral, a crucial gap in  bankability and financing of youth enterprise initiatives, has not been systematically addressed.",3633
negative,There is scope for exploring collaboration with large regional youth-based programmes of the  international financial institutions. ,3634
positive,UNDP interventions included a mix of policy support for gender-responsive frameworks and  women-targeted interventions to address the expansion of income opportunities and access to  finance.,3635
positive,"The inclusion of women beneficiaries is ensured in all income-generation, employment  and sustainable livelihood programmes, in line with UNDP gender equality policies and practices.",3636
negative,"It is hard to discern if joint United Nations initiatives in which UNDP participated improved the  capacities of government staff in carrying out sound gender analysis, or to use gender- disaggregated data to develop or implement gender-sensitive policies and budgeting processes. ",3637
negative,"There is minimal impact from one-off, small-scale initiatives targeted at women, especially when  carried out in a disconnected fashion, without linkages to upstream policy processes or  government scaling up, and apart from other development assistance programmes.",3638
negative,"In the absence  of enabling policy processes, even successful projects targeting women had limited outcomes.",3639
positive,UNDP has contributed to a more holistic strategic framework for local governance and local  development (LGLD) support that addresses poverty reduction and the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development.,3640
neutral,The overall impact at national and local levels cannot yet be assessed.,3641
negative,The UNDP role in urban poverty reduction support still needs to be clarified. ,3642
positive,"In recent years, UNDP  has launched several new joint strategic frameworks and global partnerships with the United  Nations Capital Development Fund and United Nations Volunteers programme, which established  a combined, updated framework for support to local development facilitated by local government.",3643
positive,The integrated framework to support LGLD is one such long-term endeavour that is expected to  evolve according to national contexts and the scaling up of local pilots.,3644
positive,This and other new global  strategies build on national-level engagement in local development and poverty reduction and are  relevant for generating joint responses with partner United Nations agencies and other key actors.,3645
neutral,"The new framework will take time to inform country-level responses, and it is too early to see  strategic footprints at the national and subnational levels.",3646
neutral,"Most of the outcomes from these global  LGLD initiatives are focused on localizing the Sustainable Development Goals at the subnational  level, as significant international support has been promised for translating the 2030 Agenda into  national and local objectives and activities.",3647
negative,"Instead of pursuing comprehensive engagement, UNDP often gravitates to one-off engagements  that are readily funded.",3648
negative,"This issue needs to be addressed, since it potentially diverts attention away  from more strategic urban LGLD engagement in the LDCs.",3649
positive,"Where LGLD support achieved the most impact, mutual partnerships enhanced intervention  models and efforts for scaling up.",3650
positive,"Further partnership engagements can improve the effectiveness,  sustainability and impact of LGLD support and strengthen the UNDP strategic role in local  government reforms and poverty reduction.",3651
positive,UNDP played a key role in the implementation of  national projects contributing to local economic development and the capacities of local  government institutions.,3652
positive,"Integrated livelihood approaches as part of the environment, energy, and climate change  adaptation initiatives at the community level had tangible outcomes.",3653
positive,"Community-level livelihood  initiatives have been an effective tool for mainstreaming environment within community systems,  17 demonstrating linkages to reducing poverty; creating awareness and empowering communities;  and providing models that can be replicated.",3654
positive,"UNDP community-level interventions had concrete  outcomes in enabling adoption of sustainable agriculture and livestock practices, integrated water  resources management, improved biodiversity and climate-resilient livelihoods and risk  management.",3655
positive," Addressing the unsustainable use of natural resources causing widespread  degradation of ecosystems, which is primarily linked to rural poverty, has been central to most  interventions.",3656
positive,"Rehabilitation of small-scale infrastructure such as tertiary canals, other watersheds  and small dams, enabled farmers to produce two, and in a few cases, even three crops (for example,  in Cambodia). ",3657
positive,Improvements in livelihoods and resource bases and capacities to manage climate-related risks are  factors that retained the interest of participating communities.,3658
positive,Integrated interventions by UNDP  also contributed to local administrative capacities in land and forest management and biodiversity  and ecosystems management.,3659
positive,"Mechanisms to improve common resources and governance at the  community level, along with an enabling policy environment, were key to maintaining the  momentum in LDCs where such initiatives are taking root.",3660
positive,"UNDP assisted several LDCs to mobilize domestic finance for biodiversity conservation, which  underpins rural economic development and livelihoods and proved to be transformative at the  ecosystem level.",3661
positive,"Payments for ecosystem services under biodiversity initiatives contributed to  tourism and economic development, positively impacting livelihoods at the household and  community levels.",3662
negative,UNDP has yet to effectively leverage its community-level programmes to inform national  approaches and policies on sustainable livelihoods. ,3663
negative,Fragmentation of projects with significant  livelihoods components under the vertical funds has undermined the ability of UNDP to play a  greater policy role.,3664
negative,"Fragmentation of UNDP initiatives in the environment and adaptation portfolio,  implemented individually instead of pursuing a more programmatic approach to sustainable  environment and livelihoods, undermined the potential of the UNDP contribution to government  strategies.",3665
negative,"While individual environment and adaptation projects are part of the sustainable  development framework, there is limited interface among various projects.",3666
negative,"While the  requirements of the vertical funds need a more project-based approach, UNDP did not walk the  extra mile to build on these initiatives to engage in public policy processes on sustainable  livelihoods.",3667
negative,"While there are organizational policies conducive to promoting resilience, intersecting elements of  crises and their linkages have yet to be prioritized in implementation. ",3668
neutral,"The LDCs have experienced  natural and climate-related disasters (both rapid-onset disasters and droughts), health pandemics  and conflict.",3669
positive,"At any given point in 10 to 12 LDCs, UNDP programmes are implemented in the context  of multiple fragilities.",3670
positive,"UNDP has programmes in the areas of climate-resilient agriculture and  livelihoods, inclusive growth and income-generation initiatives, economic revitalization and  peacebuilding; it is also progressively adopting ways to improve resilient development.",3671
negative,"Given this  range of support, opportunities were not used to enable an integrated approach to address  intersecting linkages between drought and poverty, or drought, conflict and poverty.",3672
negative,The project- driven approach reduced the opportunities to advocate for recognizing and addressing such  linkages in government efforts as well as in international support. ,3673
positive,Community-driven programmes have played a significant role in providing employment and quick  economic recovery in post-conflict contexts.,3674
negative,"However, short-term income-generation support, in  the absence of continuity and linkages to long-term employment initiatives, had limited poverty  reduction dividends.",3675
negative,"With exceptions, UNDP programmes have yet to transcend the humanitarian- development divide.",3676
negative,"Economic recovery and revitalization initiatives in conflict settings were often short-term, quick- impact programmes meant to address widespread unemployment, and not designed for long-term  sustainable employment creation.",3677
neutral,"Cash for work, microfinance and small-scale enterprise support  are among the most common elements in UNDP economic revitalization efforts.",3678
negative,"While such  initiatives serve to boost community-level stability and restoration of peace conditions, they are  not designed with long-term sustainable employment or enterprise creation in mind.",3679
neutral,"In post- conflict situations characterized by a collapse or exit of financial services and market service  providers, these ecosystems need to be revitalized as well.",3680
negative,"These issues, however, did not receive  adequate attention or consideration for funding in humanitarian assistance contexts, leading to  sustainability challenges of even successful short-term interventions.",3681
neutral,"In most post-conflict contexts, development support modalities are not possible until the country  transitions to normal development assistance mode.",3682
neutral,"However, as support in post-conflict contexts  shows, there is increasingly a need to break the humanitarian-development divide since a  combined approach is essential for longer-term development transition.",3683
negative,"Despite its organizational  expertise, UNDP contributions to economic recovery often failed to take a long-term development  perspective. ",3684
negative,"While the 3x6 approach and New Way of Working addressed this limitation, the  common challenge is that, in most cases, implementation of the 3x6 aproach did not go beyond  the first phase of stabilization.",3685
negative,"Whether it is the New Way of Working or 3x6 approach, partnerships  and collective outcomes will be critical and the way forward.",3686
negative,Programmes with a longer duration  that address multiple intersecting areas and build on the comparative advantages of a diverse  range of actors are critical.,3687
positive,An evolving area of UNDP support is private sector engagement in post-conflict countries.,3688
negative,"While  there have been some successes, the extent of private sector engagement does not correspond to  the extensive UNDP presence and engagement in post-conflict contexts.",3689
negative,"UNDP, as well as other  agencies, have been cautious about the opportunities and challenges engagement of the private  sector can pose in post-conflict reconstruction, employment generation and local economic  development.",3690
negative,"While there is a rationale for such caution, particularly for safeguarding local  markets, the private sector is extensively present in conflict and post-conflict contexts, and  agencies such as UNDP need well thought out programme models for engaging it in peacebuilding  and economic revitalization with long-term development linkages.",3691
positive,UNDP supported improvements in economic opportunities for women by assisting upstream policy  reforms and promoting downstream microcredit schemes and employment opportunities. ,3692
positive,"UNDP  had more success when it worked on women-specific initiatives promoting access to finance,  enterprise skills and markets.",3693
negative,Opportunities for gender mainstreaming in programme design and  implementation remain underutilized.,3694
negative,The evaluation finds that most of the results reported on gender pertain to gender mainstreaming  rather than the impacts of mainstreaming on reducing gender inequality. ,3695
positive,UNDP has included  women in various poverty reduction initiatives promoting the integration of gender-responsive  approaches to income generation and natural resources management in local planning processes. ,3696
negative,"While there are stronger efforts to better mainstream gender considerations, gender-specific  development support within interventions is not yet systematic and varies among projects, mainly  because gender analysis at the formulation stage is overlooked.",3697
neutral,The conclusions focus on strategic issues and key dimensions of the UNDP role and contribution. ,3698
positive,"Globally, UNDP's approach to addressing poverty has evolved, and new tools  19 were introduced during the Strategic Plan period 2014-2017.",3699
positive,Inclusive growth initiatives combined with  environment and climate resilience support provided greater opportunities for demonstrating income- generation and sustainable livelihood models.,3700
positive,"In some LDCs, UNDP has been an organization of choice  both in policy and implementation support.",3701
positive,"UNDP has responded and adapted to changing contexts in its poverty reduction programmes,  which has brought about a progressive evolution of conceptual understanding and approaches,  especially those espousing multidimensional poverty reduction strategies and implementation of  inclusive growth and sustainable livelihoods approaches.",3702
positive,There was a strong focus on rural poverty  reduction and livelihoods.,3703
positive,"Support for integrated planning and macroeconomic frameworks, green  growth, expansion in productive capacities and value chains, and local development have positively  contributed to policy improvements.",3704
positive,"Community approaches to sustainable livelihoods, natural  resource management, and enhancing resilience to climate change are areas where UNDP  engagement has helped generate tangible local-level impacts.",3705
positive,Women’s economic empowerment  received sufficient attention across programmes with contributions at the project level.,3706
negative,Urban  poverty is an evolving area of UNDP programme support that merits greater attention.,3707

positive,"UNDP was successful in providing policy support  on a range of issues of importance for LDCs, including inclusive growth and livelihoods.",3709
positive,"UNDP has  built a solid track record in raising financial resources for policy and institutional capacity  development initiatives, and sourcing specialist expertise from its wide network.",3710
positive,UNDP was consistent in its support for the implementation of the MDGs until the adoption of the  SDGs.,3711
positive,"With the adoption of the SDGs, UNDP has championed the UN Development Group’s MAPS  approach, designed to assist countries in incorporating the SDGs into national planning and  processes.",3712
positive,There is momentum and rising demand for tools and technical assistance to formulate  and implement SDG plans.,3713
positive,"UNDP, using its integrated approach and the multidimensional concept  of poverty and inequality, is well positioned to support countries in their efforts to implement the  SDGs.",3714
positive,"UNDP can better leverage the indices work of the organization, which complements SDG- related advocacy.",3715
negative,"Despite SDG plans prepared by the LDCs, an issue in most countries is their slow implementation  and alignment with national policies.",3716
negative,SDG integration has remained at a technocratic level and the  operationalization of the transformative programming principles and interlinkages among SDGs is  evolving slowly.,3717
positive,MAPS created opportunities for governments to take stock of existing policies and  resources and to identify processes to address development gaps.,3718
positive,"The value addition of MAPS as  a tool for facilitating planning at the national level and applying integrated solutions to poverty  reduction depends largely on its ability to provide context-specific and implementable solutions,  as opposed to generalized assessments.",3719
neutral,"Also, the success of MAPS, like its predecessor – the MDG  Acceleration Framework – will depend on establishing effective partnerships beyond UN agencies.",3720
negative,Efforts to consolidate UNDP's global policy space in poverty reduction is underemphasized.,3721
positive,"UNDP  pioneered several indices on human development, inequality, and multidimensional poverty, which have salience for measuring and reporting progress on the SDGs and for advocating transformative  principles of equality and inclusiveness in development processes.",3722
negative,This work lacked necessary  attention at the global and country level in UNDP programme and advocacy work. ,3723
positive,Conclusion 2. Recent efforts to partner with the private sector to harness market forces for positive  social impact offer UNDP a potentially transformative way of working in the future. ,3724
positive,"Some areas of  private sector engagement (such as impact finance) are at a formative stage, but hold potential to  expand productive capacities and reduce poverty.",3725
negative,UNDP's low scale of engagement in this area and the  slow pace of action is undermining its contribution to poverty reduction. ,3726

positive,"Useful  contributions have been made in areas such as sustainable livelihoods, while potential in areas  such as employment and private sector contributions remains to be further explored.",3728
positive,UNDP has a dedicated strategy for private sector engagement that recognizes the role and  transformative potential of the private sector as partners for development impact.,3729
positive,"Private sector  engagement has broadened beyond small- and medium-sized enterprises and extended to  conglomerates, impact finance providers and philanthropic foundations.",3730
positive,UNDP’s commitment to  an inclusive business and markets approach is demonstrated by the large share of core resources  invested to catalyze an inclusive private sector ecosystem for transformative effects on livelihoods  improvement and poverty reduction. ,3731
negative,But the scale of UNDP’s engagement continues to be low  when compared to private sector engagement in the development sector.,3732
positive,"UNDP has the potential  to bring to private sector partnerships its comparative advantage in policy development,  programme implementation and on-the-ground convening power to complement private sector  strengths.",3733
negative,"UNDP has yet to leverage its country support to scale up efforts to engage the private  sector, particularly in the LDCs.",3734
negative,The enabling environment in LDCs for private investment is evolving and needs a more catalytic  thrust to de-risk and troubleshoot efforts to blend local and foreign private capital with  concessional funds.,3735
neutral,UNDP recognizes the importance of new and alternative financial instruments  for facilitating development financing.,3736
positive,UNDP is well suited to facilitate greater private sector  participation and galvanize key actors.,3738
negative,It is critical that UNDP develops robust and appropriate tools  to enable private sector engagement in the LDCs.,3739
positive,"Conclusion 3. In conflict-affected and post-conflict countries, UNDP’s role and contribution to economic  revitalization have been important.",3740
positive,Community-level income-generation initiatives played a vital role  in enabling temporary benefits to affected populations.,3741
negative,"But while early conflict recovery contexts are conducive to stop-gap job-creation activities, sustainable long-term poverty reduction required  medium- and longer-term income-generation efforts earlier in the crisis recovery cycle.",3742
negative,"In addition, the lack of adequate attention to addressing the interlinking dimensions of multiple fragilities and the  challenges of income-generation capacities and investments reduced the contribution to poverty  reduction processes in fragile contexts. ",3743
negative,"For poverty reduction outcomes, economic revitalization efforts need a phased approach linked to  longer-term efforts to address structural challenges of employment and income-generation  capacities and investments. ",3744
negative,"In the absence of such efforts, UNDP’s economic revitalization  programmes in the conflict-affected LDCs have paid only limited poverty reduction dividends.",3745
neutral,"There are strong linkages between multiple fragilities such as poverty, drought and conflict that  exacerbate one another, calling for a more integrated response.",3746
negative,"UNDP supported each of these  areas individually, but did not address intersecting linkages among multiple fragilities",3747
negative,"Instead of  bringing attention to linkages among different fragilities in increasing poverty and conflict, UNDP  was often co-opted into the funding mechanisms and their focus.",3748
negative,Fragmentation of funding sources and donor priorities posed challenges to the promotion of  integrated initiatives and longer-term focus.,3749
neutral,Donors recognize the benefits of supporting  programme strategies that are holistic and have a medium- to longer-term perspective in  employment and livelihoods creation.,3750
neutral,"However, funding in post-conflict contexts continues to be  dominated by humanitarian assistance. ",3751
negative,"To make a better contribution to addressing poverty drivers  of conflict, UNDP needs larger, and more predictable, programme budgets within more balanced  humanitarian-development initiatives.",3752
negative,Conclusion 4. Inclusive growth and employment projects in LDCs could not generate scalable and  transformative solutions for enhancing productive capacities.,3753
neutral,"Interventions such as micro-enterprise  and value chain development necessitate multi-pronged initiatives, spanning from support to  community-level enterprise development to market linkages to integration and upscaling.",3754
negative,"Most  initiatives did not combine and integrate these multiple aspects, resulting in limited country-level  outcomes.",3755
positive,UNDP programmes addressed pro-poor inclusive growth issues and targeted the most backward  development regions in its programme support.,3756
positive,UNDP was more successful in enabling short-term  employment generation at the community level.,3757
negative,"However, establishing linkages between  successful community-level work and upstream policy and programme processes was more  challenging, reducing the sustainability of the outcomes achieved.",3758
negative,Initiatives that are a small  component of a set of initiatives needed for promoting employment opportunities or productive  capacities have proved to have limited outcomes. ,3759
negative,"UNDP has yet to utilize its cross-country  experience, community-level insights and close partnership with government for a more strategic  engagement in enabling sustainable income-generation solutions.",3760
negative,"While UNDP resources are not sufficient to address the full range of issues, these were not  supplemented by forging partnerships at the formative stage of programmes.",3761
positive,UNDP was more  successful when the appropriate programmatic partnerships were established to anchor the  programme models in national or donor programmes.,3762
negative,"In the absence of this, even strong  programme models remained one-off initiatives.",3763
negative,"Conclusion 5. UNDP’s contribution to sustainable livelihoods is often insufficient to make a visible  difference in many LDCs, due to the small scale of its work in relation to the magnitude of the problem. ",3764
negative,"Also, UNDP did not pay sufficient attention to consolidating its community-level sustainable livelihoods  activities in the environment and climate change adaptation areas.",3765
negative,"Although UNDP's integrated  sustainable development approach, which brings together different elements of poverty reduction, is a  well thought through strategy, it has to be fully translated into practice. ",3766
negative,"In UNDP, while there is greater recognition of the criticality of a programmatic approach addressing  intersecting dimensions of sustainable development, this has yet to manifest into programming in  the LDCs, particularly specific efforts to leverage the synergies between complementary areas of  poverty reduction. ",3767
negative,"Three years into the SDG period, initiatives under various themes of the  sustainable development pathways area remain fragmented.",3768
negative,UNDP did not build on its comparative  advantage of having simultaneous and complementary programmes in inclusive growth and  sustainable livelihoods to better position itself to inform national policies or other large donor  initiatives.,3769
negative,Siloed approaches are undermining UNDP's contribution and potential for greater policy  influence. ,3770
positive,The emphasis on interlinking and transformative elements of the signature solutions in  the ongoing Strategic Plan 2018-2021 seeks to address this limitation.,3771
negative,"However, country offices  need practical programme models that would enable them to build on the synergies among  different programmes areas.",3772
negative,Conclusion 6. A huge gap is often found between UNDP's corporate policy intent and actual  programming and resources. ,3773
negative,"Lack of selectivity in programme choices with regard to regular resources,  inadequate resource mobilization to close programme funding gaps, and insufficient strategic  programmatic partnerships have undermined UNDP's contribution. ",3774
negative,"Domain expertise is critical for  attracting non-core resources for programming, but UNDP has yet to make choices of areas in which it  needs to strengthen its technical depth.",3775
neutral,"Since UNDP’s mandate is broad, the organization has programmes in a number of poverty  reduction areas, a role dependent on the availability of adequate and consistent funding.",3776
negative,UNDP’s  current regular resources do not support such a role.,3777
negative,"Although UNDP supported a range of areas,  its efforts have had poor traction due to the fragmentation of its initiatives and its engagement in  22 low-end activities rather than a comprehensive response to address structural poverty reduction  issues.",3778
negative,"To enable sustainable solutions, it is critical to identify emerging areas where UNDP can be well  positioned to support national efforts.",3779
negative,UNDP has yet to go beyond broad areas it has identified to  develop well thought through income-generation and sustainable livelihood solutions that can be  applied with necessary country-specific adaptation.,3780
negative,"By responding to national needs and priorities  in an open-ended way, UNDP is inadvertently conveying its lack of focus and specialization.",3781
negative,The  generalist image is undermining UNDP's contribution and thought leadership.,3782
positive,The repositioning of  UNDP in the Strategic Plan 2018-2021 to address structural challenges to poverty reduction and  provide transformative solutions provides opportunities to further harness UNDP's country-level  role and re-tool its technical capacities.,3783
negative,Conclusion 7. Resource investment towards gender equality and women’s empowerment (GEWE) has  been significantly reduced.,3784
negative,"This can undermine the effectiveness of UNDP's contributions to promote  and enable gender equality in poverty reduction and sustainable development in the LDCs, particularly  in Africa.",3785
negative,"Over the years UNDP has made its intent stronger to GEWE in programme strategies and planning,  but implementation is limited. ",3786
negative,"UNDP's two-pronged strategy of targeted GEWE initiatives as well  as mainstreaming GEWE across programme areas, while important, remains under-resourced.",3787
negative,"In  LDCs, emphasis on mainstreaming gender equality across programme areas in practice did not  translate into gender-informed programming. ",3788
negative,Women as beneficiaries in UNDP programmes often  is considered a substitute for a contribution to gender equality. ,3789
negative,"Given the severity of employment  and income-generation challenges for women in the LDCs, there is more scope to inform gender- sensitive national programmes that address the barriers women face in engaging in productive  activities and labour markets. ",3790
negative,Conclusion 8. UNDP support to LDC graduation issues tends to be reactive and based on specific  demands.,3791
negative,"Given the uneven prioritization of graduation-related development issues, there is  considerable need for policy support and advocacy, especially in addressing non-income dimensions of  graduation.",3792
positive,"UNDP has provided poverty-related support to LDCs, which has contributed to their graduation  efforts, and technical support to UN Secretariat units tasked with assisting LDCs in their transition  to middle-income status.",3793
negative,"Nevertheless, UNDP has yet to play a more structured role in supporting  graduating LDCs to transition smoothly and sustainably to middle-income status.",3794
negative,It is not evident  that UNDP was able to leverage its country programme presence to provide strategic support that  accelerated graduation processes.,3795
negative,"As the LDC graduation process continues to accelerate, there is  a need for policy support and advocacy, especially in addressing non-income dimensions of  graduation.",3796
negative,"Countries approaching graduation or in the post-graduation transition stages have special needs,  which require further attention in country programmes.",3797
neutral,Loss of market access preferences calls for  competitive progression and diversification of sectors and maintaining the growth trajectory  without market preferences.,3798
negative,Graduating LDCs need support for enhancing their productive  capacities in employment and livelihoods creation and mobilizing adequate resources to  compensate for the withdrawal of concessional finance. ,3799

negative,"UNDP results are  often not very visible, due to the nature of its  interventions which may be demonstrative (pilot  projects) or not clearly tangible (such as advo- cacy and advisory support). ",3868
negative,Visibility also suffers  from the agency being too low profile in its com- munications.,3869
negative,"In addition, UNDP is often seen as  a donor, which gives rise to unrealistic expecta- tions and frustrations.",3870
negative,"Programme efficiency is considered satisfac- tory in view of the partnerships established and  an incipient refocusing of interventions, while  overall operational efficiency is moderately sat- isfactory due to delays in the provision and use  of resources and in the choice of service pro- viders in the field.",3871
positive,"Gender issues have been assiduously advocated by  UNDP, resulting in some encouraging outcomes,  especially in governance, which are likely to lead  to noticeable changes in the medium term.",3873

negative,"Most participating IOM staff at HQ, Regional  Offices (ROs) and COs reported being familiar with the MCOF, however, to different degrees,  highlighting the need for more training and awareness-raising activities.",3905
positive,"Nevertheless, the MCOF is  perceived as having supported a comprehensive approach to crises, helped address cross-cutting  issues and accounted for context-specific factors such as key political events and processes, and the  social and economic consequences of crises. ",3906
positive,"Overall, the MCOF and those developed at the RO and CO levels have helped IOM achieve the four  objectives of the Operational Framework at these respective levels, with the fourth objective faring  best (i.e. MCOF has helped IOM build on its partnerships with States, international organizations, and  other relevant actors in the fields of humanitarian response, migration, peace and security, and  development) at all levels (CO, RO and HQ).",3907
positive,"In contrast, the ten Member States that participated in  this evaluation found the MCOF as having helped IOM first and foremost improve and systematize its  response to migration crises by bringing together its different sectors of assistance within a pragmatic  9999888776-executive and evolving approach (Objective 1).",3908
positive,"Utility-wise, IOM staff at HQ, ROs and COs reportedly use the  MCOF: a) to justify and clarify IOM’s activities; b) build new and sustain existing partnerships; c) as an  internal reference, guidance, and background information; d) for programming; e) to inform national  policies, strategies, plans and institutions; and f) for planning purposes.",3909

negative,"Looking at how resources have been converted into outputs, data reveals that few IOM staff at the  country and regional levels have in fact analysed the financial and administrative requirements for  effectively applying the MCOF in implementing preparedness, response, and transition and recovery  activities.",3913
negative,This is in part explained by the fact that the implementation of the MCOF at these levels  does not always imply additional allocation of resources. ,3914
negative,"However, as the MCOF is a tool for fostering  improved internal coordination and programmatic coherence at all levels, a strengthening of the  internal coordination mechanisms and the allocation of resources on a consistent and ongoing basis  are required for undertaking comprehensive assessments and developing response strategies at  different stages of a crisis with mobility dimensions, including in anticipation of or in the wake of a  crisis situation.

negative,"When  looking at whether and how the perception of governments/Member States, donors and UN agencies  has changed regarding the usefulness of the MCOF as a reference framework for preparedness,  response, and transition and recovery efforts in crisis situations since its approval in 2012, the lack of  assessments of the MCOF rendered this question difficult for IOM staff to answer.",3917
positive,"At the operational  level, most IOM staff at the COs and ROs that have reportedly applied the MCOF, along with the IOM  staff at the HQ level, viewed the MCOF as being a useful reference tool in preparedness, response,  transition and recovery, and migration management initiatives in their respective contexts by  increasing IOM’s credibility.",3918

positive,"Finally, when it comes to evaluation dissemination and use, the analysis reveals that the  dissemination of evaluation results has been enhanced recently by introducing some new tools  such as the evaluation briefs and the evaluation repository. ",3994
positive,"The key factors identified in facilitating evaluation use are the institutional efforts made in recent years toward promoting  actionability of evaluation recommendations, as well as the new PRIMA for all system which  was only rolled out in 2019.",3995
negative,"On the other hand, key factors hindering evaluation use are the  limited use of a tracking mechanism for existing recommendations, the reduced engagement  of stakeholders during the evaluation for ownership and the scarce resources available for  evaluations.",3996
negative,"Furthermore, additional management and institutional commitment in the  promotion and use of evaluation results is required. ",3997
neutral,"Each conclusion specifically addressed a meta-evaluation questions, and they have been  numbered following the order of these questions. ",3998
negative,"On the other hand, the majority of reports fell short in  adequately addressing cross-cutting issues throughout the process, including comprehensive  recommendations and including what, if anything, could be learned from the evaluations  (lessons learned). ",3999
positive,Evaluation report templates have positively evolved over the years. ,4000
positive,"Generally speaking, the great majority of ToR available meet most of the UNEG standards.",4001
negative,"However, management arrangements are not consistently included in the majority of ToR,  neither (and more importantly) are specific concerns on cross-cutting issues, particularly  environmental issues and RBA.",4002
negative,The shortfalls found for evaluation reports and ToR might be  explained by the fact that the evaluation reports and ToR templates included in the IOM Project  Handbook do not address adequately these issues.,4003
positive,"During the evaluation design phase, the use of templates for drafting ToR and  inception reports is widespread, which is very positive to ensure consistency. ",4004
negative,"One of the key  limitations found was the lack of a systematic approach to define whether an evaluation should  be internal or external, as well as a standardized criterion to determine which evaluations are  mandatory to be followed up by ROMEOs, who usually work on a demand-driven basis.",4005
positive,"As for the implementation of the evaluation, the overall key opportunities found are the  strong institutional support toward the evaluation function and the richness of the emerging  internal network of evaluators, which ensures that generated evaluation knowledge and skills  built remain within the Organization.",4006
negative,"Concerning major challenges, the limited funding  available for evaluations, together with the short timeframes usually established and an  incipient evaluation culture with limited understanding of the potential uses of evaluations  within the Organization were considered key elements that affect negatively the quality of  evaluations. ",4007
neutral,"The great majority of reports, especially internal evaluation reports, followed the  structure of the template evaluation report included in the IOM Project Handbook of 2017.",4008
neutral,Similar is the case for the ToR.,4009
positive,This had its advantages and disadvantages: following the  templates ensured alignment to some of the key issues considered in the UNEG standards. ,4010
negative,"Conversely, the reliance on these templates led to some of the shortfalls identified, with the  consequence that those documents did not meet UNEG standards (see conclusion 1). ",4011
negative,"Furthermore, it should be noted that IOM guidelines include very useful templates beyond  ToR and evaluation report templates that could increase the quality of the final  evaluation products. ",4012
negative,"For example, IOM Project handbook include the evaluation matrix  template, that is not consistently used and that has been proven to boost report quality. ",4013
negative,"In  addition, IOM guidelines include a comprehensive list of key questions suggested for  incorporating cross-cutting themes into the evaluations, which has been hardly used in practice. ",4014
negative,"As included in the limitations section, it was not possible to analyse the influence  of time and funds earmarked to evaluations and the way they influence evaluation quality. ",4015
negative,"espite the fact that no imbalances in quality ratings were found between internal and  external evaluations, and that higher evaluation budgets did not impact the quality of  evaluation reports, the analysis is limited and no robust conclusions could be drawn. ",4016
negative,"The greatest opportunities for improvement lie in the adequate inclusion of  cross-cutting (CC) issues at all levels, including specific evaluation questions and  methodologies, addressing these issues in key findings, and more importantly, reflecting this  analysis in the final set of recommendations.",4017
negative,"Similarly, recommendations are also a key  component on which to focus, not only by ensuring CC issues are taken into considerations,  but also clearly establishing their actionability (what, how and when) and responsibility (who is  called upon to act). ",4018
negative,The systematic inclusion of a specific section on lessons learned and good  practices is also considered essential.,4019
positive,There is a positive evolution over time in the quality of evaluation reports. ,4020
positive,The analysis of the evolution of component rating over time shows that the rating for all of the  components increased for internal evaluations during the period under assessment.,4021
positive,"The main  reasons for this positive evolution are the introduction of ROMEOs, the institutional efforts  made toward strengthening the evaluation function and the introduction of updated policies,  manuals, guidelines and templates and the introduction of the evaluation training package in  late 2017. ",4022
positive,"Generally speaking, there are no relevant differences on the quality of internal  and external evaluation reports.",4023
positive,"Despite these similarities, evaluation reports conducted  internally have experience a considerable positive evolution during the period 2017- 2019, something that was not identified for external evaluations. ",4024
positive,"Additionally, internal trained  evaluators reach an overall rating considerably higher than the global average for both  internal and external evaluators, which leads to conclude that efforts made in terms of capacity  building appear to be paying off. ",4025
positive,"To complement this, surveyed staff expressed their satisfaction with the applicability of the training to their daily work, as well as their motivation and  commitment.",4026
negative,"When it comes to gaps in evaluation competencies, evaluation managers have a  lower perception than internal evaluators on their evaluation skills.",4027
positive,"There have been recent efforts at IOM that will help to effectively disseminate  evaluation results internally, such as the introduction of the evaluation briefs (2018), and the  repository of evaluations for IOM staff (end of 2019) and will be further improved with the use  of PRIMA for all database where evaluations will be stored.",4028
positive,"Concerning external stakeholders,  all evaluations reports are publicly listed on the IOM evaluation website as per the evaluation  policy, and all the evaluation reports will be accessible through the new website.",4029
negative,"Despite this,  all groups of stakeholders consulted agreed on the need to keep strengthening the evaluation  dissemination process, as well as promoting clearer guidelines and procedures for  disseminating results",4030
negative,"Concerning the use of evaluations, there is also a need to increase the  internal communication and information knowledge management to improve the performance  of the use and dissemination of evaluation results.",4031
negative,"Only by ensuring that more efforts are done  to increase the engagement of management, related staff (chiefs of mission, regional directors and regional thematic experts) and other stakeholders, will have direct results in the  accountability of the implementation of recommendations.",4032
neutral,"The analysis reveals that a great majority of evaluation reports, and more specifically, internal  reports, follow the templates included IOM Project Handbook and the IOM Development Fund guidelines.",4033
positive,This reveals a positive tendency on following the existing key documents as a  main framework when conducting evaluations.,4034
positive,"Despite the fact that some of these templates  are not consistently used, it is expected that changes in those templates that are followed would  bring about positive changes in evaluation quality. ",4035
positive,"The PRIMA for the IOM Development Fund system was developed as an initiative to deploy  an institutional project information management solution to assist IOM to develop, manage,  monitor, and report on Development Fund-funded projects and their results. ",4036
positive,"More importantly  for this assessment, all IOM Development Fund related evaluations are uploaded on the PRIMA  for IOM Development Fund system, so it is available to anyone with access to the system around  the world.",4037
positive,"Despite the fact that the system is not a repository and does not provide direct access  to evaluation reports, it made evaluations accessible, and eventually led to the development of  the new PRIMA for all system. ",4038
positive,"This system, which has only been rolled out since 2019, is  expected to contribute to the dissemination of evaluations results by linking evaluation reports  to project documents, which could be very useful when designing and planning interventions.",4039
neutral,The coaching initiative is part of the evaluation capacity building strategy launched by the  Organization in recent years.,4040
neutral,"Under this initiative, any internal evaluator can request the support  and guidance of key experts and staff within the organization during the evaluation process. ",4041
neutral,"Although the first intention was to support internal evaluators on their first assignment, the  initiative also gives the opportunity to any internal evaluator to request support to colleagues  with the goal of increasing evaluation quality.",4042
positive,"This good practice amplifies the communication  channels among IOM evaluation staff around the world and helps disseminating knowledge  and debates, while, consequently, fostering staff and organization cohesion.",4043
positive,"In addition, the  coaching initiative has a considerable potential not only to strengthen the capacities of staff,  but also to develop evaluation culture.",4044
neutral,"The scope of the meta-evaluation went beyond assessing quality of evaluation reports (and  ToR), and also put focus on evaluation processes and use.",4045
neutral,This has given a broader scope of  analysis that helped understand and explain some of the key constraints and limitations  identified as a result of the quality assessment conducted.,4046
neutral,"The exercise did not only serve the  purpose of controlling the quality of evaluations, but also the assessment of their adequacy and  opportunity to IOM context and their contribution to the achievement of the Organization´s  evaluation function. ",4047
neutral,"t provided a broader analysis and therefore it helped sustain and explain  some of the findings with regard to the context and reality in which evaluations are conducted,  ensuring a higher robustness for the whole analysis. ",4048
neutral,"All this should be considered for future  meta-evaluation exercises, which should not only focus on analysing the evolution of evaluation  report quality over time but also how processes and uses have changed compared to what has  been presented in this meta-evaluation. ",4049
neutral,The evaluation focused on the International Organization for Migration’s (IOM) contribution to the Camp  Coordination Camp Management (CCCM) Project “Enhancing the Response to Displacement – Improving  Management and Coordination in CCCM” funded by the Directorate General for Civil Protection and Humanitarian  Aid Operations (ECHO) from 2014-2015 as Phase II. ,4085
neutral,"The project provided funding to be shared between the two  co-leads of the CCCM Cluster, IOM and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the Norwegian  Refugee Council (NRC). ",4086
neutral,Overall management of the project’s Phase II was under IOM’s responsibility. ,4087
neutral,"The main objective of Phase II was “guaranteeing quick and sustainable responses to emergencies which contribute  to the protection of displaced communities in camps as well as in outside camp and urban displacement settings”,  9999888776-executive 4  with the specific objective “to provide support to Camp Coordination and Camp Management systems at the  country/regional level and effective coordination during major emergencies.”",4088
neutral,"The following four results were  expected to be achieved during Phase II: 1) Maximizing roster administration, use, and sustainability to enhance  ability to respond to large-scale emergencies and enable rapid and expert emergency support to field operations; 2) Refining the inter-cluster and inter-sector coordination to better link strategic and operational levels of coordination, in collaboration with the UN Office of Coordination for the Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), other  clusters and sectors, and through engagement with existing and new partners; 3) Improving response to urban  displacement and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) outside camps; and 4) Engaging national authorities and actors  to build better response capacity.",4089
neutral,"As per its Terms of Reference (TOR), the evaluation of the project focused on IOM’s role as administrator of the  grant and its contributions to the achievement of the results. ",4090
neutral,"The objective was “to evaluate the relevance and  achievements of the project for an improved management and coordination of the CCCM Cluster, as well as IOM’s  contributions to the overall performance of the project.”",4091
neutral,"Given that there were three other concurrent CCCM  reviews, one on the impact of capacity building efforts, another on the co-leadership structure and the third on  Gender-based Violence (GBV) mainstreaming in CCCM, this evaluation did not extensively cover areas that fell  under the scope of the other evaluations and focused specifically on IOM’s role in the project, using, when relevant,  the information available through the other reviews. ",4092
neutral,The evaluation analyzed the project design and relevance to the CCCM Strategy and the humanitarian response  architecture.,4093
positive,The evaluation found that the design of Phase II was a continuation of the initial Phase and that there  was a logical flow between both phases. ,4094
positive,"Furthermore, the evaluation found that the project was strongly tied to  the CCCM strategy; all project components were included in the strategy and helped to contribute towards it.",4095
positive,"The  evaluation also analyzed the link between the project and the Inter-agency Standing Committee (IASC)  Transformative Agenda (TA) and noted that the project addressed the three key areas of the TA: better leadership,  improved accountability to stakeholders and improved coordination.",4096
positive,"The evaluation analysed the logical  framework applied to the project making some recommendations on improvements of the indicators, noting overall  that the framework was well developed. ",4097
negative,One finding was that the indicators of the project were different from  those in the CCCM strategy and they could have been better streamlined. ,4098
positive,"Finally, the division of labour between  the three agencies was in line with their respective areas of expertise and interest; the project was designed so that  most of the activities of each result could be implemented independently of the other results or contributions from  the other agencies, with the notable exception of Result 2 which was implemented by both IOM and UNHCR.",4099
neutral,"The evaluation assessed the project performance first by evaluating IOM’s coordination role as a grant holder within  the project and then the achievement of each result, with a particular focus on IOM’s assigned results. ",4100
positive,"The  evaluation concluded that, as a global support project, it benefited from centralized management from  Headquarters (HQ) and managed to address most financial or administrative challenges they faced.",4101
positive,Overall IOM’s  coordination role as grant holder has been effective; the identification of a focal point in each agency was seen as  a positive contribution to improving joint cluster programming.,4102
positive,The narrative and financial reporting coordinated  by IOM with the other two partners and then submitted to ECHO was successfully done.,4103
negative,"Some aspects of  coordination, such as sharing more information on each of the components, could have been improved in order to  streamline the activities and identify lessons learnt that could be relevant for the Cluster as a whole. ",4104
positive,"However,  these minor coordination gaps had no impact on the overall delivery of the project. ",4105
positive,"With regards to the surge capacity (Result 1), the implementation was viewed as effective by all interviewees. ",4106
positive,The  Cluster was able to send experts to Country Offices requiring cluster support that did not have the technical  knowledge or financial means to do so. ,4107
positive,This was consistently commended as a valuable support and added-value  of the project to emergency and preparedness operations worldwide. ,4108
negative,"Based on the input from Global Team  members, the evaluation recommends to better define selection criteria to maximize the benefits and prioritize  deployments. ",4109
positive,"Under Result 2, the secondment of a CCCM-staff to OCHA was successful as it strengthened the partnership with  OCHA and formally analysed how the coordination under CCCM and OCHA’s inter-cluster responsibilities converged  and differed. ",4110
negative,"However, the matrix developed as a result of the secondment requires further adjustment to make  it a more effective tool for the field.",4111
neutral,The other component of Result 2 was the strengthening of CCCM partnerships.,4112
positive,"Engagement of partners is primarily at the local level and there has been a shift in the type of stakeholder as fewer  international organizations are involved in direct camp management; new partners, such as civil society, faith-based  organizations and national authorities, are taking on this role. ",4113
negative,The challenge is for the Cluster to reflect the priorities  of these new camp managers and also to identify opportunities to engage these stakeholders so they can benefit  from global support or guidance. ,4114
positive,The agreement to create a Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) in 2016 is a positive  step towards increasing and strengthening partnerships. ,4115
neutral,"As Result 3 implementation is under UNHCR’s responsibility, a detailed analysis of its performance was not  conducted. ",4116
neutral,"n addition to the pilot approach in urban and outside camp displacements within the project, there  are other out-of-camp methodologies which together should be compiled to provide a more holistic picture and  lessons learnt.",4117
neutral,"Result 4, engaging national authorities, was under the responsibility of IOM. ",4118
positive,"Activities have proceeded as planned,  the Mass Evacuation in Natural Disaster (MEND) guide being almost finalized at the time of the evaluation. ",4119
positive,A  positive outcome of the development of the MEND is its contribution to build partnerships with civil protection (CP)  agencies in over 15 countries and to build the capacities of national authorities to address preparedness for natural  disasters.,4120
positive,"Whilst matching civil protection with CCCM expertise has proven challenging at times, civil protection  has been identified as integral to humanitarian assistance. ",4121
positive,"CCCM should capitalize on its current efforts with CP  partners to ensure that, during evacuations, displacement is well managed. ",4122
positive,"Finally, the evaluation concludes that the four results were in the process of being achieved and the project has  contributed to an extent to the management of the Cluster such as with the manuals produced. ",4123
positive,"In addition, there  have been some positive steps towards addressing coordination for example the co-lead assessment funded by the  project, and the agreement to include a SAG.",4124

negative,"Yet, at the activity  level, most efforts were devoted to strengthening the capacities of labour inspectors at the expense of  other actors initially identified.",4285
negative,The training and ToTs were systematically offered to a Task Force initially  composed of a select group of eleven MAST labour inspectors and seven MAST managers.,4286
negative,"Yet in terms of design, even if the risks and assumptions identified in the Programme Document were  generally valid, the suggested mitigation measures were not appropriately conceptualized and  implemented.",4287
neutral,"Of the six risks initially identified, four occurred and two of those that occurred affected the  sustainability and implementation of the MCB Project, namely political instability at the national level and  turnover in MAST leadership (sustainability risk 1) and reluctance to embrace the changes suggested by the  MCB Project by some government officials (sustainability and implementation risk 2).",4288
positive,The only effective  mitigation measure was the creation of a Task Force within the MAST that allowed its members to take  ownership of the learning outcomes of the training and to remain motivated all along the process. ,4289
negative,"With regards to gender mainstreaming, although briefly mentioned in the Programme Document, gender  issues were not proactively mainstreamed in the MCB Project’s activities, even though women constitute the majority of labour force in the apparel sector.",4290
positive,"Due consideration was given to the social inclusion of  vulnerable populations, such as factory workers, who are the ultimate (albeit indirect) beneficiaries of the  MCB Project.",4291
positive,"With regards to the first IO, the MCB Project was particularly effective in strengthening the capacities of  the labour inspectors, who are part of the Task Force.",4292
positive,There was strong evidence that the quality of work  performed by the labour inspectors in the apparel sector has improved.,4293
positive,Interviewed stakeholders noted a  significant improvement in the quality of the inspectors’ work and indicated that the training had induced  important and positive changes. ,4294
positive,"There was strong evidence, triangulated across different types of  stakeholders that inspections conducted by the Task Force in the apparel sector are now taken more  seriously by employers than inspections conducted by other inspectors, by inspectors that work in other  sectors, or by those that were conducted prior to the creation of the Task Force.",4295
negative,"With regards to the second IO, the project marginally strengthened the capacities of conciliators and the  Labour Ombudsperson. ",4296
negative,"The MAST conciliators were not part of the Task Force, and there was little evidence  that their participation (and that of the Labour Ombudsperson) to some of the training created capacities  that enhanced the quality of their work or the MAST.",4297
negative,t is thus likely that the effects of these training have  been minimal.,4298
negative,"With regards to the third IO, the evaluation found no evidence the MCB Project activities  have already contributed to ensuring that workers and employers play more active roles in labour  inspections.",4299
negative,"Regarding the fourth IO, the MCB Project’s training seem to have strengthened the capacities of labour  judges, although there is no evidence that they are more adequately handling labour and employment  cases.",4300
positive,"The most significant contribution to this objective was the 40-hour initial training course organized  by EMA trainers, who were trained with the support of the project on international labour standards, on  how to put these standards into practice in the Haitian context.",4301
positive,The initial training courses are mandatory  courses that all future judges must undergo. ,4302
negative,"However, there was no clear evidence (e.g., MoU, budget allocation) that either of the courses would be offered in a near future.",4303
positive,"In terms of efficiency, the MCB Project made an efficient use of resources devoted to the training of  inspectors and ToT. ",4304
negative,"However, activities related to all IOs were often delayed and many have not been  completed.",4305
neutral,"External factors identified include: political instability and turnover in MAST leadership,  reluctance to embrace the changes suggested by the MCB Project by few government officials, political  interference in the labour inspection process, inadequate internal communication, lack of human and  financial resources, and absence of adequate infrastructure within the MAST.",4306
negative,"On the other hand, the internal management arrangements for implementing the MCB Project caused  confusion amongst stakeholders and delayed implementation, notably because of bureaucratic red tape  created by the degree of decentralization of the project across San José, Geneva and Port-au-Prince.",4307
negative,The  MCB Project was designed by Geneva staff and then passed to a newly recruited project team; this may  have affected the overall efficiency of the MCB Project to the extent it at first unable to clearly communicate  the Project’s objective or the expected roles and responsibilities of key local stakeholders. ,4308
positive,"Although limited, the collaboration between the MCB Project and BWH contributed to the achievement of  some key results with labour inspectors (the MCB Project took advantage of some potential synergies with  BWH to implement the training and shadow inspections conducted).",4309
negative,"However, both entities tended to work  in silos, communication between both was suboptimal and there were no other areas of collaboration  beyond labour inspectors’ training.",4310
negative,"At the time of the evaluation, the sustainability of the results and processes initiated by the MCB Project  did not meet the necessary conditions to ensure longer-term sustainability. ",4311
negative,"The ToT for labour inspectors  was not conducted within an institutional structure that had the mandate, capacities or resources to  replicate or scale up the training (there is no clear buy-in from high-level officials within the MAST, the  training process was not institutionalized in the ENAPP).",4312
negative,"In addition, activities related to ensuring workers  and employers play a more active role in ensuring compliance with labour law were not completed.",4313
positive,"On a  more positive note, the Task Force members were highly motivated at the time of the evaluation and were  willing to share what they have learned with their peers and work towards strengthening the MAST.",4314
positive,"In  addition, the fact that EMA trained trainers that developed a 40-hours initial course for judges were  confident they would be able to institutionalize this course was a positive outcome, which would ensure  the sustainability of this process. ",4315
negative,"Overall, at the time of the evaluation, it was unlikely that the results  achieved at this point would have a long-term transformative impact within the MAST.",4316
negative,"This evaluation shows that appropriate strategies for ensuring the replicability of a process must  not only be built into the initial intervention design, but the strategies must also account for the  institutional capacities and contexts of the organization in which the processes are to be  implemented.",4317
positive,"The sustainability strategy of including a ToT in addition to traditional training and capacity- building activities is a necessity, as it provides trained individuals with the knowledge and know- how to train their peers.",4318
negative,"However, this strategy alone is not sufficient to allow adequate  replication. ",4319
negative,Trained individuals must also have appropriate institutional support. ,4320
negative,This evaluation uncovered strong evidence that the management structure in place for  implementing a project has a direct impact on its effectiveness and efficiency.,4321
negative,"Specifically, the level of decentralization of the MCB Project was not appropriate for operations in  an environment as complex as Haiti.",4322
negative,The constantly evolving political and social situations in Haiti  require a sound understanding of the national context and sufficient flexibility for rapid decision- making and changes to planned interventions.,4323
negative,"With the ILO not having a country office with full  delegation of authority in Haiti, several implementation delays and miscommunications issues  within the project team also affected the quality of communication with key national partners.",4324
positive,"Although the MCB Project’s official objective is to strengthen the  capacities of the MAST, it has specifically strengthened the capacities of the labour inspectorate  and changed the way labour inspectors on the Task Force perform their work. ",4325
positive,"These changes  appear to have been realized by the MCB Project’s focus, over an extended period, on the training  for and consistent support of a small group of beneficiaries (i.e., 11 inspectors and seven managers  from the MAST) who had been formally invited to the Task Force.",4326
positive,"nterviews clearly indicated that  participation in the Task Force had a strong motivational effect on its members, creating not only  a sense of belonging amongst them but also feeling of ownership and responsibility for doing their  jobs adequately. ",4327
neutral,"The purpose of these visits was to allow labour inspectors to directly  witness how EAs operate, behave and implement ILS in the context of an enterprise assessment. ",4328
negative,"Given the important limitations that the MAST has been facing in terms of resources and  capacities, labour inspections were generally of poor quality and were usually not taken seriously  by employees and employers.",4329
positive,"As such, it was an immense learning opportunity for trained labour  inspectors to see how skilled professionals outside the MAST operate. ",4330

neutral,"Despite this promise of the pluralization of trade unions in Egypt, however, a draft law on trade unions  which intended to replace the Trade Union Act No. 35 of 1976 was finalized in 2017, following pushback  against the proliferation of independent unions beginning in 2015. ",4342
neutral,"The draft trade union law is found by  the ILO to fail to address long-standing concerns over the institutionalization of a single trade union  system in Egypt, in terms of the inability for independent trade unions to be recognized under the new  Law, the infringements made on workers to freely choose their trade union of membership, and hindering  the formation of new trade unions through new minimum membership requirements.

neutral,The corresponding mitigation strategies to the limitations taken up by the evaluation team are detailed  in Section 4.3.,4357
positive,"In assessing the relevance and coherence of the project, the project is found to be seen as highly relevant  among project stakeholders, and in alignment with the ILO Strategy for North Africa.",4358
positive,"The majority of  interviewees saw the project’s adoption of a three-pronged approach of targeting the MOM and its  inspectors, worker and employer organizations and indirect beneficiaries at the grassroots level, such as  factory management and workers, as innovative and highly relevant in Egypt, allowing the MOM, trade  and workers’ unions and employers to “sit at the same table.” ",4359
neutral,"In order to ensure that the project design  responds to the stakeholders’ needs, the project conducted needs assessments of the MOM, the national  inspectorate, and selected sectorial business organizations, as well as baseline studies of workers’ and  employers’ working conditions and industrial relations.",4360
positive,"This allowed the project to identify the gaps, the  most appropriate approach to address these gaps, and to ensure that the project’s logic is suitably  conducive to implementation. ",4361
positive,"The project is found to be relevant in its orientation towards benefitting Egypt’s export industries, a key  engine of economic growth in Egypt, not only in the engagement of activities aimed at increasing  productivity, improving labour standards and industrial relations, but also in creating greater labour  stability and compliance to international standards with the intention of making the sector more  attractive to international buyers and investors in the process. ",4362
positive,The design of the project was found to be coherent as it successfully adopted a tripartite approach in  which the project’s three objectives were consistent in addressing the needs of all tripartite stakeholders. ,4363
positive,Stakeholders interviewed highlighted the express involvement of tripartite constituents over the course  of the project as a key aspect of the project design. ,4364
neutral,"Several ILO project staff also expressed previous long- standing difficulties in including government actors, employers and workers in a single, consultative  framework in Egypt. ",4365
negative,"While the project was seen as coherent by the majority of stakeholders interviewed,  some recurring suggestions were made, including a greater systematic focus on child labour issues, the  expansion of buyers’ forums to include more buyers and investors, and the replication of the Better Work  program’s activities in building partnerships with brands and retailers as well other supply chain actors,  such as sourcing agents or intermediaries.

positive,"Finally, with regards  to the project’s third objective, the project was found to have built a strong base for the cultivation of  social dialogue through its tripartite approach. ",4372
negative,"However, stakeholders interviewed expressed the need  for greater efforts from the project in following up on social dialogue committees after their formation to  ensure functionality of committees and to address any issues they may be facing. ",4373
neutral,"Relating to the first objective, the project, in cooperation with the MOM, initiated the creation of a  specialized export factory inspection unit, and developed training, an inspection checklist and tools for  labour and occupational safety and health (OSH) inspectors",4374
positive,The project was found to be highly effective  in enhancing the capacities of the MOM in relation to labour and OSH inspections. ,4375
positive,The project met its  target of creating a specialized inspection unit for export factories consisting of 60 labour inspectors and  60 OSH inspectors5 . ,4376
positive,"The inspection training program was completed by the end of 2017 and has since  been delivered to governorates outside of the project’s scope (Damietta, Kafr ElSheikh and Marsa  Matrouh).",4377
positive,Stakeholders interviewed reported improvements in the harmonization of inspection practices  following the project’s interventions as a well. ,4378
positive,"As part of the project, a standard inspection check-list and  toolkit for inspectors was developed in a participatory and consultative manner.",4379
positive,"The checklist was  reported by stakeholders interviewed to have contributed to increased efficiency of labour and OSH  inspections, and has since been published on the MOM website, and circulated among the MTI, MOI, the  Federation of Egyptian Industries (FEI), the industrial chambers, exporting councils, employer and worker  organizations and the project’s targeted export factories.",4380
positive,The relationship between employers and  inspectors is also reported to have improved in terms of a positive change in inspectors’  behaviours/attitudes during inspection visits and increased awareness among employers of the inspection  process.,4381
positive,"At the institutional level, the project was also successful in validating and finalizing two databases  for labour and OSH inspectors, and in introducing a computerized process of inspection which is poised  to automate the workflow of the national labour inspectorate and improve the effectiveness and  efficiency of inspections by reducing the amount of paperwork for inspectors.",4382
positive,"Relating to the second objective, the project worked to support export factories by providing technical  assistance on labour productivity, implementing the Competitive Industries (COIN) training curriculum on  productivity and labour compliance, and organizing international buyers’ forums in the effort to improve  engagement between Egyptian export factories and international buyers. ",4383
positive,Training conducted as part of  the project at the factory level was viewed as successful by employers and workers interviewed.,4384
positive,"Positive  feedback on the project’s interventions was expressed with regards to the raising of awareness of  workers’ rights and duties and OSH standards, increased compliance with international buyers’ social  standards, improved employer-employee relations, improved human resource processes, reduction in  turnover and linkages made between factories and international buyers.",4385
positive,"The project also successfully  implemented more than 80% of the ILO’s Competitive Industries (COIN) curriculum by the end of 2016,  and the curriculum came to be shared with WISE and SCORE CTA.",4386
positive,"With regards to the third objective, the project organized a mass outreach program among workers to  raise awareness on workers’ rights and duties, promoted sound industrial relations at the factory-level  through the introduction of dispute mechanisms and worker dialogue services, and the building of  capacities of trade unions and sectorial chambers on tripartite and sectorial dialogue. ",4387
positive,"The project’s  tripartite approach was found to represent a strong base for the cultivation of greater social dialogue,  seen through the formation of and regular role played by the Project Advisory Committee (PAC,  comprising of representatives from the MOM, ILO Cairo office, FEI, QIZ, employer representatives and  trade union representatives.",4388

positive,The evaluation did not find any evidence for unforeseen adverse effects caused by the project’s  interventions.,4393
positive,"However, through data collection, the evaluation team noted a positive unforeseen result  in the replication of its training in other organizations, such as the WISE project, and in the greater levels  of discussion among private sector workers of benefits, leave days, social insurance and maternity leave. ",4394
positive,The project was found to be mostly effective in mitigating the risks that occurred.,4395
positive,"The risks for which the  project was found to have mitigated effectively were: The ongoing political uncertainty in Egypt;  Government priorities and the policy environment changing significantly in the short-term; a low level of  dialogue and trust, leading to low willingness of export factories to commit to engaging in dialogue with  worker representatives in good faith and creating a workplace culture in which trade union rights can be  fully exercised. ",4396
negative,"However, the project’s risks assessment and mitigation strategy did not include the risk  posed by external factors on the sustainability of the results of the project.",4397
negative,"As will be noted, the project’s  sustainability is found to be mixed due to the lack of ownership and maintenance of the project’s activities  among national stakeholders in ensuring that processes implemented are self-sustained and continued  following project completion. ",4398
positive,"The evaluation found the project to be in possession of a good monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system,  seen in its establishment of baseline measures in the initial phases of the project and regular monitoring  of project performance in the form of quarterly progress reports, and the launching of an end-line survey  in 2018 to track progress made by the project across its objectives vis-à-vis the baseline measures.",4399
negative,"The  evaluation finds, however, that the project’s M&E system could be improved through the inclusion of  indicators for behaviour change within its framework. ",4400
negative,"With regards to efficiency, the project experienced delays in the delivery of its activities, with much of the  project’s activities delivered between 2016 and 2017. ",4401
positive,"However, the project was efficient in engaging in  cost-sharing with the MOM and other organizations and ILO projects such as the “Decent Jobs for Egypt’s  Young People” (DJEP) project, Skills for Trade and Economic Diversification (STED), GIZ and the FEI and  industrial chambers. ",4402

neutral,"The main findings of the evaluation are presented below, grouped by evaluation question.",4631
neutral,What impact have FAO GRFA activities had on national or international policies and outcomes?,4632
positive,"As a respected authority on GRFA, FAO’s CGRFA provides the only global forum for  governments to discuss and negotiate matters specifically relevant to biological diversity  and genetic resources for food and agriculture.",4633
positive,"The Commission is well respected, and  the various SOW reports, GPAs and other normative or policy instruments have informed  governments and the public on the importance of GRFA.",4634
positive,"FAO GRFA documents have had  an international impact: citation analysis shows that in close to 100 FAO member countries,  academic publications have cited key FAO GRFA policy documents. ",4635
positive,"With regard to global  policy processes, FAO GRFA documents were cited in five (out of 20) Convention on  Biological Diversity (CBD) working documents during the 2007-2010 CBD ABS negotiation  period11. ",4636
positive,"In addition, and because of the work done by the Commission, GRFA is mentioned in global  frameworks such as the CBD’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the related  Aichi Biodiversity Target 13, which relates to the conservation and sustainable use of GRFA. ",4637
positive,"Moreover, indicators developed by the Commission are used in the Sustainable Development  Goals (SDG) 2.5, and guidelines developed in support of national GPA implementation  have helped countries in developing national policies.",4638
negative,"However, FAO’s GRFA work lacks  sufficient resources (e.g. there is very limited GRFA expertise in decentralized offices) to  provide in-country and regional policy coordination and leadership. ",4639
neutral,"The evaluation team’s survey of National Focal Points confirmed that FAO’s policy impact  is perceived to be highest at the global level, followed by the national and regional levels. ",4640
positive,"This is in line with the intentions of FAO’s policy and normative documents, particularly the  flagship policy documents, the Global Plans of Action.",4641
neutral,"What impact has FAO had on technical capacity at country level, as well as implementation of  GRFA guidance documents?",4642
positive,"FAO GRFA documents and technical assistance activities related to GRFA are considered useful  by stakeholders, and higher-income countries in particular seem to appreciate FAO’s work in  the policy sphere.",4643
positive,"The evaluation team observed sectoral differences, however, in the perceived  usefulness of GPAs: awareness of, and appreciation for, a GPA seems to rise over time. ",4644
neutral,"FAO GRFA technical assistance projects can be categorized into three main types: technical  dominant, policy dominant and information dominant. ",4645
positive,The two latter categories often were  in support of SOW reporting or GPA implementation. ,4646
positive,"In general, sustainability and impact of  technical dominant projects were greater when technical assistance and capacity development  were integrated with GRFA policy objectives. ",4647
neutral,"How successful has FAO been in its efforts to foster information exchange, facilitate networks,  and integrate GRFA issues with other normative and policy work?",4648
positive,FAO successfully linked its GRFA work to other normative and global policy work within  the Organization.1,4649
positive,"The GRFA information systems developed by FAO (particularly the  Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) and the related Domestic Animal  Diversity Network (DAD-Net), as well as the World Information and Early Warning System  on Plant Genetic Resources (WIEWS) are essential tools that enable countries to comply  with international reporting obligations, and stakeholders to access and share global  information on GRFA. ",4650
negative,"However, there is often little coordination across sectors at country  level, and the infrastructure built for SOW reporting and monitoring often collapses after  report submission.",4651
neutral,How effectively has FAO fostered partnerships around GRFA topics?,4652
neutral,The institutional landscape governing GRFA has undergone significant changes since FAO  received its mandate for plant genetic resources in 1983.,4653
neutral,"New independent organizations  and instruments emerged such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (1993), Global  Forum on Agricultural Research/GFAR (1996), Bioversity International (2006), and  especially the Global Crop Diversity Trust (2004).",4654
positive,"Some of these new entities grew out of,  or were created with support from FAO: Bioversity was initially the International Board  for Plant Genetic Resources (IBPGR) with FAO acting as secretariat, and the Global Crop  Diversity Trust was established through a partnership between FAO and the Consortium of  International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR)/Bioversity.",4655
positive,"In addition to supporting the creation of new bodies dealing with GRFA, FAO has  established a number of partnerships, such as the joint work plan between the Secretariats  of the CBD and the CGRFA.",4656
positive,"Commission meetings are attended by, and receive reports  from, organizations such as Bioversity International, Global Crop Diversity Trust, CGIAR  Secretariat, Global Forum on Agricultural Research, Convention on Biological Diversity13 and others. ",4657
positive,Technical units have established informal as well as formal relations with several  organizations. ,4658
positive,"In addition, partnerships with important donors (France, Germany, Japan,  Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) provide funding for GRFA events (e.g. meetings  related to the Commission) as well as for technical assistance projects, often in support of  SOW (and, to a lesser extent, GPA) activities.",4659
positive,Technical units have invited researchers to  contribute chapters to flagship reports for little or no compensation.  ,4660
neutral,To what extent has FAO accomplished the planned outputs and outcomes?,4661
positive,FAO has made significant achievements during the period under review.,4662
neutral,"In 2007, only two  SOWs existed: the first State of the World report on PGR dated back to 1996, and the first  AnGR SOW had just been issued.",4663
positive,"By late 2015, three additional SOWs (the second PGR,  first FGR and second AnGR) had been finalized, and the Commission’s membership had  grown from 170 to 178 members.",4664
neutral,(Two additional SOWs – Aquatic Genetic Resources and  Biodiversity – are being finalized.),4665
negative,"However, there was a high dependency on voluntary  funding to implement the Commission’s MYPOW, including SOW reports and GPAs.",4666
negative,"While  FAO has attracted a growing amount of extra-budgetary funding for GRFA activities, these  voluntary contributions have not increased proportionately with the volume of work. ",4667
negative,"At  the same time, FAO’s Regular Programme budget allocations indicate a declining trend,  and FAO’s Reviewed Strategic Framework seems to accord lower priority to GRFA work14. ",4668
neutral,Are there areas of overlap or duplication within FAO or with the work of others? ,4669
negative,"Funding for GRFA work has not been high on the international agenda in recent years;  partners like Bioversity had significant budget cuts in 2015, and the Global Crop Diversity  Trust has faced difficulties to mobilize resources (the Trust is still well below its USD 500  million pledging target, given that only USD 170 million were pledged by late 2015)",4670
positive,"Thus,  given the limited resources available for GRFA activities, the evaluation found no concrete  examples for duplication of work, although other relevant organizations could be viewed  as potential competitors, especially within the CGIAR system15.",4671
neutral,"(A competition for voluntary  contributions may exist, but the evaluation had no instrument to gauge this.)",4672
positive,"At the same  time, CBD, Crop Diversity Trust and other organizations regularly participate in, and report  to, CGRFA events.",4673
positive,"Within FAO, there was good collaboration among the sectors, as several  projects managed by the Commission secretariat included sectoral activities implemented  by the respective technical units.",4674
positive,"However, opportunities exist for improved coordination  (e.g. between the Treaty and FAO units dealing with PGRFA, as in the case of the Global  Partnership Initiative for Plant Breeding Capacity Building (GIPB), which could have  benefited from being better integrated in an overall policy framework on sustainable use).",4675
neutral,"To what extent have FAO activities recognized diversity (national, regional, gender, professional  background)? How has diversity been integrated into FAO’s activities?",4676
positive,FAO has a long history16 of recognizing diversity in its GRFA activities.,4677
positive,"This is most evident  with regard to farmers’ rights, as well as the role of women and youth in maintaining GRFA. ",4678
positive,"AnGR work recognized diversity, for example, by stressing the importance of traditional  herders and women as guardians of domestic animal diversity (2007); PGR work likewise  stressed the contribution of smallholder farmers to GRFA conservation and management. ",4679
positive,"An evolution on this theme is evident over time: the 2007 AnGr GPA did not mention  gender; the 2011 2nd PGR GPA did so extensively; the 2013 FGR GPA acknowledged in its  Strategic Priorities the important role of indigenous people and local communities, as well  as gender, to a lesser extent. ",4680
neutral,The following conclusions are drawn from the main findings of the evaluation.,4681
positive,"FAO is a respected authority on GRFA, and FAO’s Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and  Agriculture provides the only global forum for governments to discuss and negotiate matters  specifically relevant to biological diversity and genetic resources for food and agriculture. ",4682
positive,"The Commission is well respected, and the various SOW reports, GPAs and other normative  instruments have informed governments and the public on the importance of GRFA. ",4683
positive,"These  normative products are especially useful for informing lower and middle income countries on the  current GRFA situation, as well as developments governing the exchange of information and the  transfer of GRFA. FAO’s GRFA information systems are crucial resources enabling stakeholders to  access and share information.",4684
positive,"The majority of National Focal Points, representing member countries on GRFA matters,  confirmed the usefulness of FAO’s normative products on GRFA as well as the SOW country  reports.",4685
positive,There was also a clear consensus among stakeholders that the SOW country  reports provide an impetus for collecting and maintaining GRFA data at the country level. ,4686
positive,Guidelines developed in support of national GPA implementation have helped countries in  developing national policies.,4687
positive,"FAO GRFA normative products have had an international impact: FAO GRFA documents  were used17 in the Access and Benefit Sharing negotiations (2007-2010) of the CBD,  and cited in nearly 100 academic publications.",4688
positive,"Also as the result of work done by the  Commission, GRFA products are mentioned in global frameworks such as the Strategic  Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 of the Convention, the Aichi Biodiversity Target 13, and SDG  Goal 2.5, all of which relate to the conservation and sustainable use of GRFA. ",4689
positive,"Many stakeholders underlined the importance of FAO’s GRFA information systems,  particularly DAD-IS and the related DAD-Net, as well as WIEWS,  for accessing global  information on GRFA and for sharing information with a wider community.",4690
positive,FAO has established a number of formal and informal partnerships involving GRFA activities. ,4691
positive,"Within the Organization, FAO has linked its GRFA work to other normative and global policy work,  and created synergies between CGRFA and FAO’s technical work.",4692
negative,"While FAO has maintained its  unique role as a neutral policy forum for GRFA, other institutions (some grown out of FAO) have  entered the field, and FAO has lost some visibility and support to new initiatives.",4693
positive,There was little overlap or duplication of GRFA work either within or outside FAO.,4694
positive,"FAO  has established a number of partnerships on GRFA, such as joint work plans between  the Secretariats of the CBD and CGRFA.",4695
positive,"CGRFA meetings were attended by, and received  reports from, organizations such as Bioversity International, Global Crop Diversity Trust,  CGIAR Secretariat, Global Forum on Agricultural Research and CBD. ",4696
positive,"FAO’s technical units have informal as well as formal relations with several organizations,  and partnerships with important donors (France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden  and Switzerland) provide supplementary funding for GRFA events (e.g. meetings related  to CGRFA) and technical assistance projects, often in support of SOW (and, to a lesser  extent, GPA) activities.",4697
positive,Technical units have also invited researchers to contribute chapters  to flagship reports for little or no compensation.  ,4698
positive,FAO’s GRFA work is linked to such normative and global policy work as the Voluntary  Guidelines to Support the Integration of Genetic Diversity into National Climate Change  Adaptation Planning.,4699
positive,Several projects managed by the CGRFA secretariat included  sectoral activities implemented by the respective technical units.,4700
negative,"Opportunities for further  coordination exist, for example, between ITPGRFA and FAO units dealing with PGRFA, as in  the case of GIPB, which could possibly have benefited from being better integrated into an  overall policy framework on sustainable use.",4701
negative,"At the country level, the results of technical assistance projects were mixed.",4702
positive,"In most cases, projects  were relevant to the countries’ needs, especially for middle and low income countries, and have  developed immediate capacity. ",4703
negative,"However, sustainability and longer term impact were frequently  in doubt due to the one-off nature of these projects.",4704
negative,"In many countries, reporting arrangements  were not institutionalized and coordination across sectors was not developed.",4705
negative,"Many aspects of GRFA work require a longer time horizon, as legislative and regulatory  changes concerning the conservation and management of GRFA (e.g. access and benefit- sharing, or intellectual property rights) often involve slow political processes. ",4706
positive,Most GRFA technical assistance projects (both technical- and policy-oriented) were relevant  and contributed to immediate capacity building. ,4707
negative,"Focal Points on plant, animal, forest, or aquatic genetic resources were seldom  engaged in cross-sectoral coordination; arrangements for SOW reporting often dissolved  after report submission and had to be developed again each time. ",4708
negative,"There was little evidence  that after project termination ex-post assessments were undertaken to learn about: (i)  follow-up efforts to sustain the project; (ii) continuing barriers, opportunities and needs  for assistance; and (iii) a compilation of lessons that could inform future projects.",4709
negative,"FAO’s guidance and capacity development support was appreciated by countries where  it has a presence through ongoing project activities, but less so in countries where it does  not.",4710
negative,"This is likely a consequence of the one-off nature of assistance provided to countries  from headquarters, and the low level of GRFA expertise in most decentralized offices.",4711
positive,"FAO GRFA activities recognized diversity, including national/regional, gender, youth and  professional diversities.",4712
positive,"FAO has a long history of recognizing diversity in its GRFA activities, such as the 1996  paper “Farmers Rights in the Conservation and Use of Plant Genetic Resources: A Gender  Perspective”. ",4713
positive,"FAO papers and guidance documents increasingly promote farmers’  rights, emphasize the role of women and youth in maintaining GRFA, and recognize the  importance of traditional societies, women, smallholder farmers and indigenous people to  GRFA conservation and management.",4714
negative,"To some extent, GRFA work has not been fully synchronized within FAO (Commission and  technical units). ",4715
negative,"Changes in FAO’s overall strategic priority setting were not always reflected in the  CGRFA work programme, and the implementation of ongoing mandated GRFA activities was not  always without competition for limited resources.",4716
negative,"The time may be opportune to look into FAO’s  institutional architecture for GRFA work, and develop ideas for better integration and increasing  synergies.",4717
negative,"GRFA work has become less visible in FAO’s Reviewed Strategic Framework, approved by  the FAO Conference in 201318, and Regular Programme allocations decreased over the  2014-2015 biennium.",4718
positive,"At the same time, through CGRFA FAO was given the mandates for  additional SOW reports: Aquatic Genetic Resources and Biodiversity are currently under  preparation, in addition to the three already finalized SOWs, and CGRFA has committed  to the Third Plant Genetic Resources and the Second Forest Genetic Resources SOW  reports.",4719
positive,"Furthermore, FAO is expected to manage the reporting efforts, and to monitor  implementation of the GPAs for AnGR, PGR and FGR (and for aquatic genetic resources and  biodiversity in the future).",4720
positive,"FAO has successfully mobilized extra-budgetary contributions for GRFA work, which  increased in the 2014-2015 biennium.",4721
negative,"However, recent examples suggest that these  voluntary contributions have not grown proportionately to the increased volume of work,  especially in the context of the Aquatic Genetic Resources report, and that funding and  staffing constraints may begin to affect GRFA work in general, particularly the CGRFA’s  Multi-Year Programme of Work.",4722
negative,"In this regard, FAO could optimize work-planning and  resource allocation as well as explore new ways of doing business to maximize the use of  limited resources.",4723
neutral,"In 2013, against the background of a growing funding shortfall, UNHCR decided to reduce its footprint  in Southern Africa.",4751
neutral,"Per a series of decisions, UNHCR’s operations in Angola, Botswana and Namibia  were intended to significantly phase down and/or close. ",4752
neutral,"In the years that followed, phasing down was  realized in significantly different ways in each of these countries.",4753
neutral,The Namibia country office closed.,4754
neutral,"  Botswana, the phasing down process stalled.",4755
neutral,"In Angola, a new refugee influx caused the reversal of  the downscaling.",4756
neutral,The present external evaluation was commissioned by the Regional Office for Southern Africa in  Pretoria (ROSA) and managed by the UNHCR Evaluation Service.,4757
neutral,"The evaluation explored four main  areas of interest, and this report is structured accordingly. ",4758
neutral,"First, it clarified, analysed and assessed the  decision-making process to phase down UNHCR’s operation and/or presences in the three countries  concerned. ",4759
neutral,"Second, it examined the planning for phasing down and third, implementation of these plans  through 2016. ",4760
neutral,"Finally, based on the findings, this evaluation highlights lessons learned and specifies  recommendations that apply to the countries concerned and ROSA. ",4761
neutral,"They are also relevant to UNHCR  in the preparation and planning of phasing down operations and closure of office presences elsewhere,  and relate to broader questions regarding the global role of UNHCR.",4762
neutral,These four main areas of interest were explored with the help of a set of pre-established key evaluation  questions.,4763
neutral,"Information was gathered mainly through the review of documents and other records, as well  as interviews with a variety of stakeholders, including UNHCR staff and former staff at Headquarters  and in the Field, government officials and other partners, as well as refugee representatives. ",4764
neutral,"In addition,  a workshop was held in Pretoria with senior UNHCR staff from ROSA and the Southern Africa sub- region to present and test preliminary findings, and to sharpen conclusions and recommendations.",4765
positive,"The evaluation found that UNHCR’s decision to consider phasing down operations and its presence in  Angola, Botswana and Namibia implicitly leveraged specific opportunities for phasing down that  these countries offered at the time. ",4766
positive,"In particular, numbers of persons of concern had already decreased  in preceding years and a significant additional decrease was anticipated, as the majority had found, or  were about to realize, a durable solution. ",4767
positive,"There were assumptions made about the ability and  willingness of governments and other partners to assume responsibilities and take over from  UNHCR, as well as about the transfer of residual responsibilities to the Regional Office in  Pretoria in the context of the regionalization policy. ",4768
negative,"Nevertheless, when the 2013 decision was made, the intended outcomes were formulated only in  terms of office structures and presences.",4769
negative,"The decision did not include a transparent analysis of  underlying assumptions and preconditions that could have guided field offices; as a result, appropriate  strategies, with clear indicators, operational milestones and roadmaps were not developed based on such analyses; and could not be used to support the review of progress in subsequent years. ",4770
negative,"Furthermore, translating UNHCR’s mandate, and role, into more tangible standards or benchmarks  proved challenging, and in the absence of strategies and roadmaps, offices came up with their own  interpretations of the decision, and defined their own benchmarks and plans and processes for  implementation.",4771
negative,"Where offices developed comprehensive phase down plans, there was no agreed,  robust mechanism to monitor progress. ",4772
negative,"The available organizational planning guidance did not provide sufficient support to the offices on this  issue, including on what standards for protection and assistance could be agreed with governments.",4773
negative,"In practice, most planning assumptions did not hold up.",4774
negative,"The numbers of persons of concern did not  decrease, anticipated durable solutions did not materialize, and major gaps remained in the creation of  conditions for hand-over of responsibilities to governments and other partners.",4775
negative,"While concerns about  protection and solutions benchmarks were raised by different staff and stakeholders involved in the  phase down process, the main focus remained on reducing expenditures regardless of whether it  affected protection or durable solutions outcomes. ",4776
negative,"By 2016, UNHCR was less able to carry out  protection and solutions activities for persons of concern, directly and through partners.",4777
negative,"Refugees felt  frustrated and abandoned, protection risks had increased, and phasing down left UNHCR less able to  respond to new emergencies.",4778
negative,"Given the absence of an articulated analysis of the conditions leading to the decision to phase down  and the absence of available monitoring information on the implementation, it is difficult to say whether  objectives for the phasing down were met. ",4779
negative,extent to which reduction in overall expenditures  was attributable to the 2013 decision cannot be calculated due to limited tracking of resources that went toward the phasing down process and of the unintended additional costs and liabilities it  generated. ,4780
negative,"In terms of lessons learned, the evaluation has shown that a decision to phase down UNHCR presence  ought to be preceded by a robust situational analysis, assessing international commitments and  obligations together with capacities and abilities of different stakeholders, and that these should benefit  from government and partner consultations and include an agreed-on time frame.",4781
negative,"Furthermore, there  are strong indications that closing down UNHCR’s presence in a country may require a concentrated  and controlled deployment of additional resources before and during the transition. ",4782
negative,"n other words,  ending UNHCR’s presence per se should not be seen necessarily as a cost-saving measure in the short  term.",4783
negative,"Rather, in operational terms, the phasing out of office presence should mirror the opening of a  country presence which is often part of an emergency response: costly, tightly monitored, involving  additional experienced staff and resources, following an agreed basic planning scenario, with a clear  vision of end results (including measurable indicators, benchmarks and other progress measurements)  and implemented with the appropriate level of transparency and accountability. ",4784
negative," such, the evaluation  is recommending further guidance for phasing down which should support offices to sufficiently capture  the complexity and organizational choices for engagement in each context and go beyond numerical  calculation of persons of concern/staff ratios as a parameter for decisions on budgeting and staffing. ",4785
negative,"Informed by these experiences with phasing down, it is recommended that UNHCR should reconsider  the issue of responsible closure of country presence not as a sudden decision, often precipitated by a  lack of funding, but rather as an essential and natural part of its operational life cycle globally, and a  reflection of States’ responsibility for international protection.",4786
negative,"For this to happen, UNHCR should re- focus on the essentially temporary and time-limited nature of its presence in a country in the context of  supporting the development of the responsibilities and capabilities of the host State. ",4787
negative,"It should ensure  that, in time, closure of its presence is conducted in a transparent, accountable and respectful manner,  where international protection norms are respected and refugees are protected and assisted in their  country of asylum while on a path to a durable solution. ",4788
negative,"In the current context of the three  countries in Southern Africa, this would mean an engaged high level dialogue with the respective  host governments, both nationally and as part of the international community, to clarify the  vi rationale and long-term objectives of UNHCR’s country presence, in the context of the international  protection framework, and to refocus operations appropriately.",4789
neutral,This evaluation focuses on the performance of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) as Cluster Lead Agency (CLA) for the Global Protection Cluster (GPC) and Field Protection  Clusters (FPCs) between 2014 and 2017.,4814
neutral,"The evaluation has the dual objectives of learning and accountability  and seeks to generate evidence regarding the extent to which UNHCR has effectively performed its CLA role,  both at the country and global level. ",4815
neutral,"The focus is on learning how the 26 protection clusters, for which UNHCR  is the CLA at country level, are supported by the GPC, and what lessons have been learned by UNHCR in field  CLA situations. ",4816
neutral,"The evaluation examines the achievements and challenges of the cluster at global and field  level with regard to coordination, capacity building, and support to the field and mainstreaming protection. ",4817
neutral,The cluster approach was established in 2005 as part of the humanitarian reform process with the aim of  strengthening system-wide preparedness and technical capacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies.,4818

neutral,"The GPC coordinates the development of policy, standards and operational tools relating  to protection in humanitarian action, including practical guidance on how to establish and manage protection  coordination mechanisms. ",4820
neutral,"In order to fulfil the requirements outlined in the terms of reference (ToR) as well as the expectations  expressed by UNHCR and key stakeholders during the inception phase, the evaluation adopted the following  principles as part of its approach:  Ensuring rigour through a robust approach to evidence assessment by using i) an evaluation matrix,  comprising four overarching evaluation questions (EQs), 11 sub-questions and a number of indicators for  each sub-question; and ii) an evidence assessment framework to organise and analyse the data, draw out  key findings and assess the strength of the evidence supporting the findings.

neutral,"The evaluation team used a building-blocks approach to the evaluation, which involved dividing the evaluation  process into sequential steps from inception to data collection to synthesis of findings and reporting in order  to build a robust chain of evidence.",4824
neutral,The data collection methods employed during the evaluation are listed  below: ,4825
neutral,692 key documents were reviewed by the evaluation team which included 460 from the field  missions and desk reviews.,4826
neutral,The evaluation engaged with approximately 80 headquarters staff members and 300 informants  across six field missions and two desk reviews.,4827
neutral,"The evaluation team, in coordination with UNHCR, identified six case study countries where  UNHCR is the CLA.",4828
neutral,"Field missions included Afghanistan, Pakistan, Honduras, Democratic Republic  of Congo, South Sudan and Iraq, in each of which the team engaged a diverse set of informants at  national and sub-national level. ",4829
neutral,Two desk reviews were conducted of Nigeria and the Typhoon Haiyan response in the Philippines. ,4830
neutral,The purpose of these was to strengthen the evidence base to support the findings of the desk  reviews. ,4831
neutral,The evaluation team engaged with communities in five of the six missions for the purpose of  assessing good practice in accountability in protection programming.,4832
neutral,"An online survey was circulated to all UNHCR-led protection clusters to fill evidence gaps, to  capture broad perceptions of the effectiveness of the clusters and to assist in identifying  recommendations.",4833
neutral,"241 responses were analysed (184 in English, 38 in French and 19 in Spanish)  from across cluster coordinators, co-leads, AoRs and members. ",4834
neutral,The evaluation team explored four key evaluation questions:  How effectively has UNHCR led and coordinated the Protection Cluster at field level? ,4835
neutral,How predictably has UNHCR led and coordinated the Protection Cluster at field level? ,4836
neutral,How effectively and predictably has UNHCR led and coordinated the Global Protection Cluster?,4837
neutral,To what extent has UNHCR as cluster lead agency advocated for the centrality and mainstreaming of  protection at global and field levels?,4838
positive,"The effectiveness of UNHCR’s cluster leadership in delivering the six core functions of cluster coordination at  field level has been mixed: FPCs have performed most consistently well in their support to service delivery, in  providing protection analysis and, linked to this, support to advocacy on the protection of civilians. ",4839
negative,"Performance of FPCs was far more variable in determining strategic priorities and in developing work plans,  which negatively impacted their ability to monitor their performance. ",4840
negative,AAP is frequently considered to be a seventh function of cluster coordination; it has also regularly been  highlighted as one of the weakest components of the implementation of the TA.,4841
negative,"The evaluation found no  explicit or consistent evidence of promotion of AAP by FPCs although protection actors, including UNHCR, had  AAP mechanisms in place. ",4842
positive,"UNHCR has strengthened its resourcing of the cluster with more dedicated posts at field level, particularly in  large, complex emergencies.",4843
negative,"However, there have been challenges in recruiting the right people with the right  skills at the right time, which UNHCR’s Division of Human Resource Management (DHRM) is now beginning to  address.",4844
positive,"For the period under review and for clusters that have already been activated, UNHCR has had some  measure of success in ensuring the continuity of cluster leadership.",4845
positive,"Where gaps have occurred, these have  frequently been covered on an interim basis by UNHCR staff or by surge staff from standby rosters. ",4846
negative,UNHCR has made mixed progress in its collaboration with core cluster partners. ,4847
negative,"While it routinely draws on  the support of co-leads and sub-clusters to deliver predictable leadership, this is compromised by a lack of  clarity about how the lead-co-lead relationship is moderated and the uncertainties surrounding field-level  cluster architecture and reporting.",4848
negative,"While these challenges are frequently overcome through field-level  negotiation, greater direction from UNHCR would provide a stronger foundation. ",4849
negative,"UNHCR has been partially  successful in managing relationships with key interlocutors including UN Missions and government  representatives, although it could strengthen guidance to assist clusters in managing these important  relationships.",4850
negative,Collaboration with local NGOs and civil society groups is an area that UNHCR could strengthen  and there is the potential for it to play a leadership role among peer CLAs in setting an agenda for transforming  its engagement.,4851
negative,The predictability of UNHCR’s leadership is undermined by the lack of clarity that exists between the FPCs and  the sub-clusters about the PoLR role.,4852
negative,"While PoLR exists at the conceptual level, the complex cluster  architecture has caused confusion about how to operationalise these important responsibilities.",4853
negative,"UNHCR’s  leadership of the cluster is also affected by Country Representatives interpreting its CLA responsibilities  inconsistently, which can compromise perceptions of the cluster’s neutrality.",4854
neutral,A final factor that has an  important influence on predictability is planning for transition and de-activation.,4855
negative,"The evaluation found that  UNHCR, like other CLAs, has been inconsistent in putting in place coordinated plans for transition and de- activation. ",4856
positive,The increase in UNHCR’s funding for the GPC during the period under evaluation and the associated increase  in dedicated posts have considerably strengthened both the GPC’s capacity and its autonomy from UNHCR. ,4857
positive,The absence of a mechanism to monitor progress against its work plan makes it difficult to assess the  effectiveness of UNHCR’s support but the evaluation found that support to the field has been strengthened  during the period under evaluation. ,4858

neutral,"E-survey respondents from South Sudan, Mali, Kenya (urban), The Gambia,  Chad, among others, commented on the need for this kind of strategic approach and contingency  planning in their complex operating environments. ",4962
positive,"Through this evaluation, TANGO has seen evidence of how UNHCR livelihood programming strengthens  the resilience capacities of PoC households, communities, and national systems, even if not explicitly  stated in programme strategies.",4963
positive,Some examples of these resilience capacities provided through UNHCR  staff interviews and case studies include:  Bonding social capital in India (absorptive): The programme’s group organization process has increased bonding social capital within refugee communities. ,4964
positive,"As a result of this, refugees feel  better able to cope with daily challenges as well as significant household shocks (like sickness or  death) by accessing support from friends and neighbours.",4965
positive,Bridging social capital in Uganda (adaptive capacity): Some refugees have increased access  to land because they negotiated with host community members with whom they’ve formed  relations through livelihoods projects. ,4966
positive,Building human capital and social networks in southern Mexico (adaptive capacity): The  technical and vocational training has provided asylum-seekers and refugees with skills and social  networks through which many have found employment opportunities.,4967
positive,Community conflict resolution and social cohesion in Ethiopia (absorptive capacity): The  programme has promoted peaceful co-existence among refugees and host communities through formation of farmer cooperatives that comprises both population groups.,4968
positive,Livelihood diversification in Malawi (adaptive capacity): PoC have diversified their livelihoods  activities from proceeds earned from the livelihoods programme. ,4969
positive,"For example, a livestock  beneficiary diversified to pig production for commercial purposes. ",4970
positive,Savings and community credit established in Uganda’s South Sudanese operation  (absorptive capacity): The agricultural and non-agricultural micro-enterprise development  programme has supported the creation of village savings and loans associations (VSLAs).,4971
positive,"These  community credit structures have provided starter capital to its members who have now  established micro-businesses, and many can meet their basic needs.",4972
positive,Access to services and markets in Turkey (transformative capacity): The programme has  worked with the national Vocational Qualifications Authority to ensure PoC have access to the  certifications and employment that match their skills and experience. ,4973
negative,The main internal factors hindering efficiency and effectiveness are  limited programme budgets and the barriers of the one-year project cycle.,4974
negative,The five case studies confirm these results.,4975
negative,"The programmes  inefficiently spend their limited time and resources on repetitive planning and reporting each year,  including for the completion of the MC.",4976
negative,"The livelihood programmes have little assurance of resources  from one year to the next, which limits their ability to do multi-year planning; this causes a sense of  frustration among operations staff. ",4977
positive,"The internal factors enabling programme efficiency and effectiveness are livelihood team capacity, intra- office cooperation, and support by the CO management and CO strategy for innovative shifts in the  economic inclusion approach. ",4978
positive,"n Turkey, for example, there is a small yet highly capable livelihoods team;  they have built a referral pathway with protection teams in order to promote lasting employment with the  most vulnerable PoC.",4979
positive,"UNHCR Costa Rica adjusted their internal structure to integrate protection and  durable solutions into one division with two units, allowing for better coordination and integration between  the protection and livelihoods teams.",4980
positive,The shift to a strategic livelihoods partner approach in Rwanda has  been made possible through management support and a CO-wide strategy that envisions refugees as  self-reliant contributors to the development of Rwanda. ,4981

positive,The case studies and staff KII show that programme design based on thorough market analyses and  participant and stakeholder experience enhances efficiency and effectiveness.,4985
positive,"These assessments are  promoted through the components of the MC, a structure that all case studies found useful overall (see  KEQ 2 key findings, below). ",4986
negative,"Yet, the ET finds that even with good standards in place, the implementation  of the standards and overall quality and effectiveness of the programmes will continue to be comprised  under a one-year project cycle. ",4987
neutral,"External factors affecting efficiency and effectiveness are partner  capacity (relating also to partner selection, an internal issue) and the legal and economic enabling  environments. ",4988
negative,"From KIIs with UNHCR staff, the selection of partners with poor capacity is attributed to  rushed selection due to the one-year cycle and the preference for traditional or known partners such as  humanitarian NGOs as opposed to those with development expertise.",4989

neutral,PoC mind-set is another factor affecting outcomes.,4991
negative,One in five operations report that access to cash  interventions or other assistance hinder PoC desire to participate in livelihoods.,4992
negative,The ET finds there is a  need for UNHCR to assess how dependence on humanitarian assistance (from UNHCR or partners) and  its own messaging around vulnerability and durable solutions contribute to PoC willingness to engage in  livelihoods. ,4993
positive,"TANGO acknowledges the  ongoing processes and challenges of developing the livelihood programme monitoring system, and  UNHCR has made major positive strides in implementing an improved system.",4994
negative,"For the Focus Data, consisting largely of output indicators, the  ET finds there are significant issues with data quality and data collection inconsistencies. ",4995
positive,"Recognizing  these challenges with the Focus Data, it is important that UNHCR began monitoring livelihoods outside of  Focus through the revised monitoring indicators.",4996
positive,These indicators provide crucial evidence to the  organization on achievements beyond output level indicators.,4997
positive,The revised livelihood monitoring system has also improved many of the data quality issues by providing standardized indicator reference sheets  and ensuring a cross-sectional sample of 100 across operations.,4998
positive,"UNHCR has been able to improve its  household-level data collection expertise and capacity through partnership with the World Bank Joint  Data Centre, and there may be additional opportunities for joint monitoring. ",4999
negative,"Further, important contributions by UNHCR through its facilitative role with government and private sector  are not being captured in reporting that only counts direct beneficiaries.",5000
negative,"As the livelihoods sector of  UNHCR moves more toward operational partners and capacity building and as improved monitoring  continues to develop, new outcome and impact indicators are needed to measure systems-level changes. ",5001
positive,"UNHCR first released the Minimum Criteria for Livelihoods Programming in February 2015 to bring  greater accountability and quality assurance in livelihoods programming, but has recognized the need to  shift and adapt these guidelines since their initiation. ",5002
positive,The vast majority of e-survey respondents view every component of the MC as contributing to their  desired livelihood and protection outcomes. ,5003
positive,"Many operations appreciated the structure provided by the  MC, which improved the design, efficiency, and quality of activities.",5004
positive,"Market and value chain analyses,  livelihoods strategic plans, guidance on livelihoods expertise required for staff, and the targeting  components are considered the most helpful.",5005
negative,"Poor partner capacity (related to UNHCR’s partner  selection) is the most commonly reported challenge of implementing the MC, as well as insufficient  funding such as to cover the costs of conducting ongoing market assessments. ",5006
neutral,"Many operations need technical guidance and support for conducting rigorous assessments, monitoring  and impact measurement. ",5007
positive,"Baseline, assessment and monitoring activities were considered useful, where  available; though the quality and availability of these monitoring activities are often constrained by partner  capacity, resources, and the one-year timing.",5008
positive,"Overall, the ET finds the shift to the Minimum Economic Recovery Standards (MERS) for guidance in  cases of future livelihoods programme implementation (direct or funded through partners) to be  appropriate. ",5009
positive,"Most UNHCR livelihood operations acknowledge the important role UNHCR has in coordination with  government and development actors, including advocacy for policies at the national level.",5010
negative,The evaluation  finds there is room for improvement in operations’ coordination with financial service providers (FSP). ,5011
positive,"Over half of operations believe UNHCR is best positioned as a facilitator and/or capacity builder in their  operational context, partnering and coordinating with other stakeholders to include refugees in their  programmes (see figure below). ",5012
negative,"Many operations see this as the long-term vision of UNHCR’s role, but  there are concerns about how this role would  mean less work on the ground. ",5013
positive,UNHCR livelihood staff see a clear  comparative advantage for their work; UNHCR  knows refugees and the legal framework more  than any other humanitarian or development  actor.,5014
positive,Other themes on why UNHCR should be  involved in livelihoods include: UNHCR can drive  policy on economic inclusion.,5015
positive,UNHCR is positioned to be the bridge of the humanitarian- development nexus for refugee livelihoods. ,5016
positive,UNHCR should be a lead coordinator/convener  around refugee livelihoods.,5017
positive,"Finally, UNHCR  should continue to do protection work with an  economic inclusion lens, though careful not to  over-protect, as building livelihoods involves an  empowerment mind-set. ",5018
negative,Two-thirds (67 per cent) of e-survey  respondents felt the sustainability of their livelihood programme was unlikely (if UNHCR funding ended). ,5019
positive,"Recognizing this, many operations are shifting to development-oriented and systems-level approaches. ",5020
positive,"Joint programming with United Nations agencies and other development, government, and private sector  actors appears to be growing among operations.",5021
positive,The ET finds there is opportunity for learning from and  expanding these partnerships. ,5022
positive,UNHCR has an important role to play as a convener of the livelihoods  sector coordination as it relates to refugees. ,5023
positive,It is critical that UNHCR is at the table in conversations that  involve the humanitarian-development nexus and refugee contexts because UNHCR knows refugees.,5024
positive,UNHCR should be part of the conversation not only about refugee protection but also about refugee  livelihoods and economic inclusion. ,5025
neutral,"The ET’s analysis of political and economic ‘context typologies’ shows the major constraints and fluidity of  the operating environments in which UNHCR is implementing the programmes, which relates closely with  the resilience and shocks discussions above.",5026
positive,"In contexts with the ‘best’ political and economic enabling  environments, UNHCR’s role is best as facilitator, linking PoC to government and private sector systems. ",5027
neutral,"These are contexts with the most potential for going to scale, working on transformative capacities and  institutional level change.",5028
neutral,"In contrast, the operations with poor political and economic enabling  environments are contexts where UNHCR’s focus will be primarily in protection and safety nets, i.e.,  absorptive capacities.",5029
positive,"In this context, UNHCR still has a role in building the foundation for self-reliance  and development through the provision of basic needs (e.g., education), advocating with government,  donors, private sector and development actors to make investments in refugee livelihoods. ",5030
positive,"The evaluation shows that UNHCR’s Global Strategy for Livelihoods (2014-2018), with its focus on  economic inclusion and market-based activities, has initiated a positive shift within the global  portfolio of livelihood interventions.",5031
positive,"UNHCR’s livelihood programmes have increased partnerships  with government and development actors, including other United Nations agencies.",5032
positive,"The programmes are  learning and adapting from the new ways of working with private sector, financial service providers, and  various government entities. ",5033
positive,"In many COs, the conceptual linkages have been made that connect the  mandates of protection and durable solutions with livelihoods; protection and livelihoods teams are  working together to promote livelihoods for vulnerable PoC in many cases. ",5034
negative,"Yet, there are significant challenges limiting the impact and scale of UNHCR’s livelihood programmes. ",5035
neutral,"The annual budget cycle, small budgets, and poor partner selection/capacity for many of the operations  are key factors affecting the effectiveness, sustainability, and reach of interventions.",5036
neutral,"The political, legal,  security, environmental, and economic environments have a substantial effect on the ultimate  achievement of refugee economic inclusion.",5037
negative,"Given that most UNHCR programmes are operating in  contexts of protracted displacement, shocks will be a mainstay of the operational context, which is why a  resilience framework is key. ",5038
neutral,"TANGO recognizes that a fundamental question for the livelihood strategy moving forward is not only how to do livelihoods, but if UNHCR should do livelihoods.",5039
positive,"The ET concludes that yes, UNHCR should be  involved in livelihoods, but in a strategic role. ",5040
positive,UNHCR has the comparative advantage of knowing  refugees and understanding the legal frameworks that best enable refugee self-reliance,5041
positive,"UNHCR has a  key role to play as a facilitator of systems and policies that enable refugee access to economic  and financial inclusion, and a key role in continuing to ensure protection throughout the  humanitarian-development continuum.",5042
positive,"n all, these roles build the foundation of refugee access to  basic services and systems on which economic and development activities will depend. ",5043
negative,UNHCR must continue in its protection work but with a more intentional livelihoods and resilience lens in  building absorptive capacity. ,5044
negative,"To build transformative capacity, UNHCR should be a key advocate,  leader, and coordinator/convener in the refugee livelihoods sector. ",5045
negative,he evaluation finds that UNHCR is  not the best positioned to do the work of building adaptive capacity of refugees at the individual or  household levels.,5046
negative,"UNHCR should coordinate with partners operating at scale to fill that role of individual- based livelihood interventions: e.g., vocational trainings, business start-up, financial literacy, language  learning, individual work permit applications, etc.",5047

neutral,"Some 40 percent of Member States report that they  have a specific department that deals with curriculum in a Ministry in charge of  education, 30 percent state that curriculum is handled by several departments in the  Ministry, and 30 percent report having a dedicated national institution for curriculum  development outside the Ministry. ",5122
neutral,"In some cases, civil society and research  organizations also provide support to national institutions, while bilateral partners can  also be engaged in curriculum, such as the Department for International Development  (UK), Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (Germany), USAID or the  Governments of Australia and the Netherlands.",5123
neutral,"In addition, several universities have a department on curriculum and/or pedagogy,  providing services to governments on the development or revision of curriculum. ",5124
negative,"However, the review found that academia is often involved with a limited perspective  that does not always cover global challenges and lacks expertise in comprehensive  curriculum reforms that imply broad public consultation processes. ",5125
negative,Some interviewees  have also stressed that the actual production of reliable material from academics to  support Ministries’ work and reforms remains rather minimal.,5126
negative,"Apart from UNESCO, there are a number of international and regional organizations  that engage in curriculum development, however only touching upon a specific aspect  of the curriculum process. ",5127
neutral,"At the global level, among the most active organisations in  the field of Curriculum, UNICEF’s work on curriculum development targets children  and youth, with a focus on learning outcomes and related issues such as competence- based curricula and language of instruction, while the World Bank’s activities often  target vulnerable populations, with a focus on capacity development and improving  teaching, learning and assessment.

positive,The review concluded that curriculum should remain an area of UNESCO’s  education programme as it addresses a clear need from Member States. ,5139
negative,"To address  curriculum with added value in the future, UNESCO should focus on providing  methodological technical assistance, capacity development, standard-setting and policy  advice to support curriculum processes, products and competences in Member States. ",5140
positive,"Complementary to work on curriculum from a methodological point of view by a  dedicated entity, thematic Sections at Headquarters should continue elaborating content  on specific crosscutting topics. ",5141
positive,". As curriculum implies both technical and political dimensions, UNESCO can act as  a neutral broker, to facilitate informed and inclusive policy dialogue.",5142
positive,It also has a long- term tradition in facilitating complex curriculum processes in often difficult and  sensitive contexts.,5143
positive,"In addition, UNESCO has the capacity to serve as a platform for  international exchanges and comparative research, including through networks such as  UNESCO Chairs, and coordinating knowledge hubs and communities of practice. ",5144
positive,"Furthermore, the review points out that a category 1 institute as a lead entity in  curriculum constitutes an adequate solution for addressing the needs and requests from  Member States in a coordinated and holistic manner.",5145

positive,"As such, there is  an important symbiotic relationship between the IGGP, UNESCO and these partners,  which manifests itself in the day-to-day implementation of the Programme. ",5182
negative,"There is a lack of internal coherence within the Programme, illustrated by the absence  of more formal programmatic links between the IGCP and the UGGp. ",5183
negative,"The activities, outputs and medium-term outcomes of both IGGP pillars are quite  distinct and, as a result, the governance and practical implementation of the sub- programmes under IGGP are largely separate.",5184
neutral,"This separation is also due to the  different histories of the two sub-programmes, with IGCP having been a UNESCO  programme since its inception in 1972, while UGGp came into UNESCO in 2015  after a long history under the GGN. ",5185
negative,"While the evaluation identified a meaningful  potential for such closer collaboration, the actual level of cross-pollination from a  programmatic perspective is very limited.",5186
negative,This appears to be a missed opportunity  for generating synergies towards achieving more significant results at a larger scale  with an equal amount of resources. ,5187

negative,"As the selection of geopark evaluators is  concerned, some stakeholders expressed the need to further clarify the criteria used  to identify evaluators as well as to publish the results of the selection process. ",5219
positive,"This said, three quarters of the on-line survey respondents considered the technical  and scientific soundness of the geoparks evaluation and designation process  (including evaluation missions) as excellent or good. ",5220
positive,"In particular, respondents  praised the geoparks evaluation process as very positive, citing a process of learning  and knowledge exchange rather than a top-down approach.",5221
neutral,"According to the  geoparks, going through the evaluation process itself provided them with valuable  lessons and insights as to how improve their project.",5222
negative,The quality of programme monitoring may be improved.,5223
negative,The IGGP as a whole does currently not have an appropriate monitoring and evaluation  system. ,5224
negative,"The Programme lacks a theory of change, as well as an accompanying results  framework, thus not allowing for measuring the extent to which the Programme  generates results in line with its original ambitions.",5225
negative,"This represents an opportunity  for improvement for the Programme, both in terms of accountability and learning, as  well as in terms of effective steering and management.",5226
positive,"Given the lack of a formal results framework, the evaluation was unable to produce  a solid quantitative assessment of Programme effectiveness, yet the Programme is  yielding positive results in line with intended goals. ",5227
neutral,"Through the IGCP, an average of 20 to 30 projects are funded each year. ",5228

negative,"Expansion to sub-Saharan Africa and Arab States remains an important  challenge, despite recent efforts to increase Programme presence and visibility  in those regions.",5234
positive,Evidence on the benefits generated by the access to the UGGp  certification is abundant,5235
positive,"UGGp outcomes include improved geopark management  and planning systems, established links with geoparks from other countries,  increased understanding of the importance of geological heritages and improving  general culture and knowledge around them, more sustainable tourism and  increased engagement on behalf of local / indigenous communities.",5236
positive,"The creation  of employment and economic activity, potential reduction of migration, reducing  territorial fragmentation / isolation and empowerment of women point to the likely  broader socio-economic impacts. ",5237
negative,Funding represents the most important limitation to Programme implementation and  is a potential risk to Programme sustainability. ,5238
negative,"All stakeholders reported funding as an issue for IGCP, both in terms of its effects on  the limited amount of funding for individual projects and the limitations in numbers  of projects that can be supported at any one time.",5239
negative,. Funding limitations faced by UGGp also represent a major  bottleneck and will limit efforts to expand and improve the Programme,5240

negative,"For emerging geoparks, particularly in fragile contexts, ensuring sustainable sources  of funding is a major hurdle and threat to survival.",5242
negative,"Securing long-term funding streams is a critical issue, especially for geoparks in  developing countries, which tend to have limited access to sources of public  funding. ",5243
neutral,The example of the Mixteca Alta geopark in Mexico perfectly illustrates this  challenge. ,5244
negative,The issue is likely to be significant in new geoparks in Africa as well.,5245
positive,"In moving forward with the implementation of the IGGP, the Programme should  capitalise and further build on the very positive results achieved to date",5246
negative,"At the same  time, it should take advantage of the opportunity to introduce some adjustments,  which have the potential of significantly boosting its impact and ensuring its long- term survival.",5247
negative,"These mainly relate to the need to ensure a stronger commitment  and broader financial base for the Programme and the operations of its Secretariat,  as well as to the need to continue improving UGGp selection and evaluation  procedures and criteria. ",5248
negative,"Regarding the latter, while the UGGp should be looking to  consolidate its expert-driven and international dimension, it should also ensure that  the necessary conditions are established to generate full trust and confidence within  the Member State community that decisions are taken on the basis of criteria and  procedures which are of the highest standards.",5249
negative,"In the future, the IGGP – and particularly the UGGp pillar - should also explicitly  ensure that it takes on a more targeted approach to providing support in Africa, as  well as other regions of the world which are currently mostly absent from its realm  of intervention, such as Arab States.",5250
positive,The UGGp model and approach offer great  opportunities to spur growth and social cohesion in isolated territories hosting  fragile populations.,5251

positive,The importance of ICT in Education is growing globally and Agenda 2030 contains several references.,5401
negative,"While some believe the potential contribution of ICTs to SDG 4 - Agenda 2030 is underestimated, the prioritization of ICT in Education within UNESCO is constrained by a number of factors.",5402
negative,"These include a somewhat reduced visibility in the current 39 C/5 Programme and budget7, the absence of an organization-wide explicit reference to the strategic importance of ICT in Education across multiple dimensions of education and limited regular programme (RP) resources8",5403
negative,"While the evaluation came across various specific interventions addressing the needs of disadvantaged groups including those with a focus on girls and women9, it found that considerations of inclusion and gender equality were not consistently mainstreamed into policy-related and capacity building interventions and their related monitoring systems.",5404

positive,"In alignment with the priorities of the African Union’s 2063 Agenda10 in particular, some larger extrabudgetary initiatives were implemented at country-level across the continent.",5407
negative,"The fact that ICT in Education is not a single programmatic area but rather a set of relatively discrete interventions undertaken by a range of units of different types and locations within UNESCO, makes the current forms of coordination and communication challenging, both in terms of coordinating and optimising the use of the skills and resources available in UNESCO.",5408
negative,The evaluation found several areas of work where the mandates of the different key entities working in ICT in Education overlap.,5409
negative,"While this does not necessarily lead to duplication, the potential for collaboration and complementarity is not fully exploited.",5410
negative,"Current issues include a lack of clarity on roles and strengths of each entity, an absence of clear focal points as mechanisms for regular interaction, and a lack of clear guidance from UNESCO’s senior management.",5411
negative,"Furthermore, the fragmentation of websites related to the theme renders UNESCO’s contribution in this area less visible, not easily accessible externally, and creates an obstacle to maximising the visibility, quality and relevance of UNESCO’s work under this theme.",5412
negative,"While the evaluation found several examples to show that very positive results are achieved when cooperation and coordination are successfully exercised, such as in the collaborative work on the development of the ICT competency framework for teachers (CFT), limited exchange of such experiences reduces learning and the application of lessons learnt, and thus of replicating good practices across UNESCO.",5413
negative,Most UNESCO entities involved in ICT in Education would therefore welcome several (though not necessarily all) of the features of a single programmatic area.,5414
negative,A number of issues also emerged in relation to resource distribution and financial modalities.,5415
positive,"Given the UNESCO-wide dearth of regular programme (RP) funds, the extrabudgetary (XB) funding has contributed to the development of projects and growth of staff to enhance UNESCO’s global positioning in the field and play an intellectual role in priority areas such as in mobile learning and the use of AI in education.",5416
negative,"However, a more agile approach to the management of staff recruited under extrabudgetary resources could encourage sharing of resources and expertise among entities and units.",5417
negative,"Furthermore, the current primarily sector-based accountability frameworks12 and financial management mechanisms are not facilitating enhanced collaboration and distribution of funds across UNESCO.",5418
positive,"ICT in Education has increasingly been successful in securing extrabudgetary funding, and the theme continues to be attractive to donors.",5419

negative,"Most financing is earmarked, which has to some extent been constraining activities and developments in certain UNESCO priority areas.",5421
negative,Only a few exceptions14 were identified where funding was secured through long-term partnerships with international entities and the private sector.,5422
positive,"Project-based partnerships with the private sector15 are increasing, and there is scope for expansion if an appropriate vision and mechanisms are in place.",5423
positive,"UNESCO is attractive for the private sector not least as private sector partners seek access to UNESCO’s expertise in education, which is complementary to their own expertise in hardware and software development, as well as access to policy makers and to verified research16",5424
positive,"Furthermore, being associated with the UNESCO brand ensures image enhancement.",5425
negative,"However, the key UNESCO entities in ICT in Education, individually or collectively, do not rely on specific guidance or lessons learned regarding the modalities and terms of partnership and engagement with the private sector in the field of ICT in Education.",5426

positive,"While this evaluation was not in a position to draw comprehensive conclusions across the huge range of projects and interventions undertaken by UNESCO in ICT in Education, the evidence collected points to positive achievements across different dimensions of UNESCO’s projects and actions in OER and ICT CFT policy and capacity building support, as well its support for Master Plan development.",5428
positive,"However, despite not being a single programmatic area, the evaluation found that performance indicators (PIs) and targets for Expected Results related to ICT in Education have been fully or partially achieved.",5429
negative,"On the other hand, the reporting systems so far reveal little of whether and to what extent final or longer term outcomes are achieved; nor do they refer to the quality of these achievements.",5430
negative,The ERs and associated performance indicators were thus not deemed adequate for assessing whether these interventions have achieved their ultimate objectives i.e. contributing to more equitable and higher quality education.,5431
negative,"Furthermore, due to the lack of a validated and in-depth theory of change in reporting systems on interventions, there is little evidence available of significant in-depth analysis and learning of ‘What works’ and ‘how’ within a specific national context and other circumstances and assumptions that might contribute to the outcomes ultimately sought.",5432
negative,"This holds true both for policy support and institutional capacity building in ICT in Education, and for international policy platforms and dialogues.",5433
negative,"At the much more crowded level of ICTs in the learning environment, such as in the development and piloting of new pedagogic approaches, UNESCO also achieves more limited visibility.",5434

negative,"Obstacles for following through and going beyond initial results include insufficient funding to mainstream policy and institutional change and, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, poor supporting infrastructure such as electricity and telecommunications.",5436
positive,All UNESCO entities involved in ICT in Education can also point to several examples of projects that target women and girls.,5437
neutral,"At policy and institutional capacity-building level, targeting is necessarily indirect, as direct beneficiaries are rather upstream at the policy and institutional level, reaching sometimes to the level of teacher training or curriculum development.",5438
negative,"While disadvantaged groups are cited in project documents among the final beneficiaries, it cannot be concluded that ‘inclusion’ is systematically mainstreamed in policy and institutional capacity building work.",5439
negative,"The mainstreaming of key aspects of ICT in Education in the 39 C/5 resulted in a loss of visibility and although it is unlikely to be reversed, future programming cycles may offer scope for more visibility of ICT in Education as a thematic area.",5440
negative,"Current project monitoring, reporting and evaluation systems offer limited data for quantitative or qualitative analysis of outcomes and learning, that might be used to enhance such visibility.",5441
negative,"UNESCO’s visibility at all levels of interventions is perceived not as strong as the projects, activities and achievements would merit, individually or collectively as a theme.",5442
neutral,"Most prominent are the Mobile Learning Week, the ICT Competency Framework for Teachers, the OER work, at macro level especially, and the inter-government policy dialogues.",5443
negative,"At the level of ICTs in the learning environment, in particular for some priority areas and for most vulnerable groups, UNESCO’s interventions are not gaining sufficient visibility compared to other players with much larger funding envelopes",5444
positive,"UNESCO has developed and piloted pedagogic approaches on the use of mobile learning for literacy, such as for disadvantaged teachers, and for refugees.",5445
negative,"However, not least due the funding limitations, visibility of the projects in these areas has not received adequate attention.",5446

negative,The desired balance and connection between UNICEF’s issue-based and systems approaches  to child protection has not been spelled out.,5949
negative,"A related operational challenge is the relationship  between the systems-strengthening approach and work to address violence against children,  which has been positioned as the unifying umbrella concept in SDG 16.2 and SP Goal Area 3. ",5950

negative,"Finally, UNICEF’s programmatic approach to CPSS has so far not distinguished  between different levels of functioning or maturity of national CP systems.",5952
positive,Conclusion 3: UNICEF has had considerable success in advancing the child protection  systems agenda at the national level and in raising awareness among national partners. ,5953
negative,"However, by and large, this has not translated into adequate domestic investments in  CPSS.",5954
positive,"In most countries reviewed as part of this evaluation, UNICEF’s role in evidence generation,  systems mapping and assessments, and costing of child protection systems has helped to  change the understanding of government partners. ",5955
positive,UNICEF technical support has also helped  to improve key components of CP systems. ,5956
negative,"However, in most cases, this shared understanding  has not resulted in resource commitments from governments. ",5957
negative,Conclusion 4: Donors have played a largely negative role in advancing national CP  systems by distributing funding on a narrow issue-by-issue basis and using parallel  monitoring and reporting systems. ,5958
negative,The organization has so far failed to present key  donors with a compelling ‘business case’ for child protection systems strengthening.,5959
neutral,Many donors primarily require readily- and quickly-measurable results expressed in terms of  numbers of children benefitted. ,5960
negative,This has led to favouring parallel service-delivery systems that  undermine systems-strengthening.,5961
negative,"UNICEF staff are therefore challenged to design projects  that meet donor expectations for high numbers of early beneficiaries, while also contributing to  broad and lasting development results in terms of a robust CP system.",5962

positive,"Conclusion 6: The evaluation has identified a number of interventions that are  particularly effective for strengthening CP systems, including capacity-building/social  workforce strengthening, leveraging public resources, evidence and research and policy  advocacy. ",5969
positive,This provides some clarity on priority investments for UNICEF. ,5970
positive,"Stronger child protection systems benefit most from UNICEF investments in evidence and  research, leveraging public resources, and policy advocacy.",5971

positive,"In  countries with weaker CP systems, UNICEF often invests significantly in community-based child  protection mechanisms and provides direct financial and technical support for child protection  services and infrastructure. ",5973
negative,"Conclusion 7: UNICEF’s ambitions for what a child protection system can be expected to  accomplish in specific contexts, and in what timeframe, have not been realistic. ",5974
negative,"Some of UNICEF’s objectives in terms of child protection systems strengthening are oriented to  the short- and medium-term, whereas achieving functional child protection systems is a highly  ambitious long-term goal.",5975
negative,"This may have led to ‘over-selling’ and ‘under-delivering’ on systems- strengthening efforts in some contexts, which may in turn have undermined partners’ confidence  in CPSS. ",5976
negative,"Relatedly, in better functioning systems, child protection results often rely on a  network of allied health, education and social protection systems that shoulder the main burden  of prevention and early intervention.",5977
positive,"Conclusion 8: UNICEF has a clear niche focusing on state accountabilities for children’s  rights and partnering with government departments at national, provincial and district  levels.",5978
negative,"However, the organization has yet to define its role with regard to children’s  participation, community-based child protection mechanisms and coordination between  formal and less formal actors.",5979
negative,"In terms of the ideal programme-impact pathway for CPSS, the dichotomy between formal and  less formal child protection structures may have been overstated.",5980
positive,"As the QCA findings showed,  in some of the countries with functioning child protection systems, UNICEF also successfully  invests in community-based child protection mechanisms.",5981
negative,"Investing in children’s civil rights (to  information, communication, association and civic engagement in child protection systems) may  be an area of opportunity with regard to the participation of girls and boys in CPSS.",5982
negative,Conclusion 9: Investments in staff capacities and learning for CPSS have been  insufficient.,5983
positive,"In some countries and regions, experienced UNICEF staff have been able to provide strong  strategic leadership to mobilize donors, governments and other implementing agencies to  advance the systems agenda in creative ways.",5984
negative,"However, many countries lack this capacity.",5985
negative,"The  skill set needed for CPSS goes beyond what is typically found in CP staff, and includes public  finance, institutional development, results-based management, research/analytical skills and  strategic leadership (convening, persuading and influencing).",5986
negative,"These competencies do not seem  xiii to have been sufficiently considered in hiring, promotion and retention of staff as well as in  learning initiatives.",5987
negative,Conclusion 10: UNICEF’s corporate reporting systems on expenditures and results are  inadequate to demonstrate the exact level of UNICEF’s contribution.,5988
negative,"Coherent corporate-level metrics for CPSS are yet to be established, both at the level of the  intermediate outcomes (elements of the CP system) and at the level of UNICEF expenditures  and investments contributing to these outcomes.",5989
negative,"For the 2014-2017 period in particular, it has  been difficult to assess investments, as it is unclear which ones were considered “systems  strengthening” at CO level when expenditures were recorded.",5990
negative,"Evidence from UNICEF’s  corporate results reporting systems, while markedly improved as part of the SP, 2018-2021,  remain patchy.",5991

neutral,"The rationale for the enhanced intervention included a desire of  the national government to harmonize and standardize their ECD trainings to improve the quality of all ECD  learning settings, regardless of delivery model or implementing organization.",6025
neutral,It was also based upon the  recognition that additional training in the ECD neurosciences would elevate caregiver and parent understandings  of the importance of early childhood and of play in supporting child development.,6026
neutral,"Finally, there was an interest in  exploring how the traditional forms of play could enrich the relevance and sustainability of the ECD kits.",6027
neutral,"The enhanced ECD kit intervention was implemented by the Ministry of Education and Sports with UNICEF’s  technical assistance and included an increased training dosage (from three to five days of one-off trainings under  the foundational intervention to three, five-day face-to-face sessions over nine months) for all early childhood  caregivers in ECD concepts and skills; the integration of the ECD neurosciences into parenting programs and  caregiver training (including the use of stories or graphics to convey important message); and a parenting  education program with home visits with more than 600 participants across 18 sites in the Bidibidi refugee  settlement.

neutral,"In addition, a local toymaking innovation was examined to understand if there were any added  benefits or challenges when integrating this activity within the parenting program. ",6029
neutral,The primary objective of the evaluation was to document and analyse the benefits and challenges of the ECD  kit interventions for children and their caregivers through a formative evaluation design that could yield  judgments on the effectiveness of different training approaches. ,6030
neutral," secondary, but related objective of the  evaluation, was to assess the relevance of the ECD kit interventions in relation to the country and  programming context.",6031
neutral,"To ensure UNICEF’s equity agenda was addressed, the evaluation also included an  approach for analysing the relevance and effectiveness of the ECD kit interventions for different subgroups, such  as children with differing abilities, and girls and boys from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, as relevant to  the selected contexts.

positive,Both the foundational and enhanced ECD kit interventions were well aligned with UNICEF’s country  programme plans and provided an entry point for UNICEF to address the needs of young children.,6047
positive,The kits  enriched the learning environments of ECD centres and child friendly spaces and demonstrated to caregivers  and parents the importance of early learning and stimulation through play.,6048
positive,Both the foundational and enhanced ECD kit interventions were well aligned with government policies and  priorities for early childhood at a national level.,6049
positive,"Play-based teaching and learning is highly valued by the  Government of Uganda, and the ECD kit interventions helped to support this approach to young children’s  development.",6050
positive,"There was a high need for play materials in ECD centres within Uganda on a national level,  according to national ECD managers and trainers.",6051
positive,"The ECD kit interventions were well positioned at the time of the crisis in South Sudan due to the strong  enabling environment for ECD in Uganda, including a national ECD policy, quality guidelines for ECD centres  in emergency settings, and early learning and development standards for children ages 3 to 6.

negative,"However, the overcrowded conditions and the caregiver-to-child ratio (1:50 to 1:250) far exceeded  government guidelines (1:20), especially during surge conditions.",6053
negative,"While outside the scope of this evaluation,  the data indicates that this ECD centre guideline was not followed in practice, which created challenges in  play affordances, opportunities and experiences over time with the ECD kits.",6054
neutral,Evaluation Question 3: What were the mechanism and processes through which the ECD kit ‘foundational’ and  ‘enhanced’ interventions were effective?,6055
neutral,"The extent to which the ECD kit interventions were effective depended upon the degree to which the toys and  learning materials were integrated into existing programmes for young children, which varied by:  o the phase of emergency response and recovery; o the affordances for play provided in each ECD centre over time; and o caregiver exposure to the Community Child Care Programme and, in particular, their participation in  local toymaking (the enhanced ECD kit intervention)",6056
neutral,"The adoption (or frequent use) of the ECD kits initially varied by delivery model (ECD centres focus tended to  use the toys for cognitive development, while child friendly spaces tended to use the toys for social emotional  learning) ",6057
neutral,Other factors that shaped the adoption (or frequent use of) the ECD kits included:  o access and storage of the toys and learning materials;  o caregiver capacities to use the toys and learning materials with large numbers of children in  classrooms; and  o the type of play experiences promoted by the caregivers.,6058
neutral,Evaluation Question 4: How effective were the adult capacity development approaches used in the ‘foundational’  and ‘enhanced’ ECD kit intervention with regards to the desired outcomes and impacts? ,6059
positive,There were no notable differences observed in caregiver capacities to use the toys between the foundational  and enhanced ECD Kit interventions until a majority of the caregivers were exposed to the Community Child  Care Programme and the toymaking was fully implemented.,6060
negative,"Caregivers received no direct training on the toys and materials in the foundational ECD kit intervention and  instead relied upon intuition and experience to use them, which varied by level of previous teaching  experience.",6061
positive,"Caregivers became more aware of the importance of early childhood and best practices for programming  through the national, standardized ECD training (the Enhanced ECD kit intervention); however, their  capacities in play-based learning did not improve until they participated in making and using local toys.",6062
neutral,Evaluation Question 5: How have UNICEF and its partners adapted or added to the standard kit to make them  more sustainable in actual practice?,6063
neutral,The toymaking innovation was designed to increase the number of play materials in the centres and to  engage parents in supporting play and ECD. ,6064
positive,Hundreds of parents were involved in making replica ECD kit toys and traditional toys that drew upon their  own play experiences and cultural traditions as well as locally available materials to ensure sustainability. ,6065
positive,"The toymaking process involved the adaptation of the most popular toys within the ECD kit (such as the  shape sorter and puppets), using the kit as a model or guide for reproduction. ",6066
positive,"Caregivers and parents learned more about how each toy was designed to support children’s learning and  development at different ages, using the information contained in the ECD Kit Activity Guide. ",6067
neutral,Evaluation Question 6: What changes in caregiver interactions with children and the use of the ECD kit for  learning and development were observed as a result of the ‘foundational’ versus the ‘enhanced’ ECD kit  interventions? ,6068
positive,There were no notable differences observed in caregiver interactions with children between the foundational  and enhanced ECD kit interventions until the toymaking was fully implemented.,6069
positive,"Because of the increased access to local toys, caregivers were observed transforming their interactions with  children from rote teaching with the toys, to a more child-centered approached based upon guided learning  through play. ",6070
positive,"This transformation in caregiver capacities was also possible because they were exposed to the Community  Child Care Programme and because each child had access to a toy either individually or in small groups,  which increased their overall engagement in play activities. ",6071
neutral,"Evaluation Question 7: How did changes in caregiver outcomes vary among different sub-groups, such as  parents, preschool teachers, ECD practitioners, and community members?",6072
positive,Caregivers attributed playing with children to helping them overcome their own trauma and provided them  with a source of stress relief during both the foundational and enhanced ECD kit interventions. ,6073
positive,"Caregivers and parents from different cultural and tribal backgrounds bonded over the local toymaking  process, which contributed to benefits in community cohesion and integration within the settlement. ",6074
positive,"Parents reported playing with their children more often at home because of the toymaking innovation, which  contributed to more positive discipline approaches and to their nurturing care. ",6075
positive,"The local toymaking innovation engaged fathers in playing with their children, which has previously been  considered outside of cultural norms. ",6076
neutral,"Evaluation Question 8: How and to what extent did the ECD kit interventions contribute to children’s psychosocial  well-being, early learning and developmental outcomes?",6077
positive,"Both of the ECD kit interventions contributed to changes in child outcomes, as reported by caregivers and  parents.",6078
negative,"However, it is difficult with existing data to isolate any differences from these approaches on specific  child outcomes. ",6079
positive,"Both the interventions contributed to changes in children’s language development and developing  mathematical concepts, such as colors, shapes and counting. ",6080
positive,"Children’s social emotional learning and development were also enhanced by both interventions, but  especially through the use of local toys. ",6081
positive,Relating to others was a significant theme that steadily expanded  across the time periods.,6082
positive,"Children were described as building confidence and basic social skills as a result of  their play experiences, including consistent reports by caregivers and parents that they were fighting less,  making new friends, sharing their toys, and building confidence at the sites with full implementation. ",6083
positive,"Caregiver and parent reports of children’s recovery from trauma and stress reduction were significant themes  at time 1 and 2, and diminished over time 3, but reflect the importance of play in reducing toxic stress in  children. ",6084
neutral,"Evaluation Question 9: How did these outcomes vary for girls and boys of different ages and backgrounds, as  relevant to the country context?",6085
neutral,"Though caregivers offered the same play opportunities to both boys and girls, there were differences during  free play times across all time periods.",6086
neutral,"Girls tended to play more with dolls and puppets, while boys tended to  play with locally made balls, blocks, and model cars.",6087
neutral,"Younger children (aged 3-4) played with shape sorters and wooden beads more often, while older children  (aged 5-6) played with stacking cups and card books more often.",6088
neutral,"However, there were no reported or observable differences between the outcomes girls and boys received  from playing.",6089
positive,"Ugandan and South Sudanese refugee children equally benefited from the ECD kit toys and learning  materials, indicating their inclusive use in practice. ",6090
positive,The primary lessons learned through the evaluation included the following:  ● The hands-on toymaking is especially effective in bringing alive the concepts of learning through play  explained in the earlier sessions of the enhanced ECD kit intervention and led to better adoption of play- based learning practices by both caregivers and parents. ,6091
negative,"Given the overcrowded conditions, an infusion of ECD kits at time 2 to better match UNICEF standards (1 kit  for every 50 children) did not contribute to any observable differences in the way the toys were used by  caregivers and children in the classroom.",6092
positive,The transformation in caregiver capacities and interactions with children from rote teaching to play-based  learning and engagement was related to their better understanding of the toys and learning materials after  they were involved in replicating the ECD kit toys. ,6093
positive,Including parents own play experiences and traditional forms of play contributed to the success of the  toymaking innovation. ,6094
positive,Working towards a common goal such as the toymaking promoted social cohesion across cultural differences  with the settlement. ,6095
positive,"Conclusion 1: Relevance to National ECD Context – Both ECD kit interventions were appropriate for the  Uganda country context, as well as the emergency context. ",6096
positive,"lay-based teaching and learning is highly valued by  the Government of Uganda, and the ECD kit interventions helped to support this approach to young children’s  development.",6097
positive,The enabling environment that existed for early childhood prior to the emergency contributed to the  ability of the Ugandan Government to respond to the needs of young children in the Bibidibi refugee settlement.,6098
negative,"However, the overcrowding of classrooms and the caregiver-to-child ratio far exceeded government guidelines  during surge conditions and remained a persistent challenge to play affordances and experiences over time with  the ECD kits. ",6099
positive,"Conclusion 2: Relevance to UNICEF Country Programming – Both ECD kit interventions, and especially the  local toymaking innovation, were relevant for UNICEF’s equity agenda and its objectives for ECD programming in  the country.",6100
positive,"UNICEF reached highly vulnerable women and children through these interventions, including  unaccompanied children providing care for their younger siblings",6101
positive,"The findings indicate a reduction in toxic stress  and relief from trauma among children, parents and caregivers as a result of the play-based teaching and learning  with the ECD kits, and especially the when the enhanced training and local toymaking innovation was fully  implemented.",6102
positive,Children also grew in their social emotional skills and cognitive development through play with the  ECD kits and locally made toys.,6103
positive,"Parents reported playing with their children more often at home after the  toymaking took place, including fathers. ",6104
negative,Conclusion 3: Effectiveness of the Foundational ECD Kit Intervention – The foundation ECD kit intervention  was limited in its effectiveness in terms of leveraging the ECD kits for play-based teaching and learning.,6105
positive,"The  foundational ECD kit intervention enriched the learning environment of the ECD centres in the Bidibidi refugee  settlement, and served as an important entry point for UNICEF to stimulate and support ECD programming. ",6106
negative,"However, the effectiveness of the foundational ECD kit intervention depended largely upon the intuition and  previous teaching experience of caregivers to use the toys and learning materials effectively in the classrooms  and the approaches emphasized by NGO partners (school readiness versus psychosocial supports).",6107
negative,"Thus, some  13  child development outcomes were reported after the foundational ECD kit intervention took place, but they were  limited in scope and variety (primary stress reduction, counting and language development).",6108
negative,"Conclusion 4: Effectiveness of the Enhanced ECD Kit Intervention – The effectiveness of the enhanced ECD  kit intervention took time to observe in practice given the devolution of the national training on the district level  was not fully implemented until the third evaluation field visit, and not all caregivers received this training. ",6109
negative,"While  the standardized national ECD training (the enhanced ECD kit intervention) gave caregivers new teaching  strategies and improved their overall understanding of early childhood development and the importance of play- based teaching, there were largely no observable differences in caregiver capacities to implement play-based  teaching until the local toymaking innovation took place.",6110
positive,"In other words, the transformation in caregiver practices  appear to be strongly associated with the local toymaking dimension of the enhanced ECD kit intervention.",6111
positive,"The  toymaking also helped parents to support play-based learning at home, which created a continuum of learning  between children’s home environment and the ECD centres.",6112
positive,"Children’s social emotional learning was particularly  affected by the enhanced ECD kit intervention, and especially when the local toymaking took place. ",6113
positive,"Children were  observed fighting less with their peers, and developing positive social skills such as sharing.",6114
positive,Some parents also  reported children’s motivation to attend the ECD programme increased after the local toymaking took place. ,6115

neutral,"It uses a community-based approach to achieve “improved capacity to implement and monitor inclusive, equitable and quality early childhood education (ECE) services.” ",6124
neutral,The Government of Lao PDR and UNICEF recognise that the global evidence is incontrovertible – weak services and toxic stressors damage children’s brains and their future potential.,6125
neutral,"In summary, the case for investment is: 1. Rights-based – every child has rights as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and reinforced in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2. Physiological – the brain is almost fully developed by the age of six and thus the foundation for the future potential of a child to learn and to be successful is established in this early period of their life 3.

positive,Relevance: · There is an overwhelmingly positive consensus from 90% of government representatives that the CBSR programme is relevant to Lao PDR’s needs and policy context. ,6145
positive,"Community demand was also very high, with 96% of community-level respondents expressing support.",6146
negative,"However, in the five CBSR target provinces, enrolment of 3 to 5 year old children in ECE is very low, recorded at only 17% in Saravan Province (2014).",6147
neutral,"his confirms the need for rapid, cost-effective solutions to a problem which is not being resolved currently by existing institutional models such as pre-primary classes and kindergartens. ",6148
negative,"The inclusion and training of community members as the CBSR Facilitators increases the relevance of the programme in tackling the context of both shortage of Govenrment-trained- and-salaried personnel, but also tackling language barriers for non-Lao-speaking groups, which was a challenge specifically mentioned by 45% respondents.",6149
positive,Effectiveness: · The CBSR programme is effective and could be made more so with minor adjustments (detailed in section 6.4).,6150
positive,The CBSR curriculum and materials are in line with effective ECE programmes in other countries.,6151

positive,"Calculations provided in Section 4.1.311 show a cost per child of USD 196 in year one of the intervention, but with potential to decrease significantly in subsequent years, down to below USD 60 per child. ",6159
negative,"This is still more costly than other international models, which have achieved cost per child rates of less than USD 25 per child.",6160
neutral,"Despite the education policy and its specification for all instruction to take place in Lao language, many remote and ethnic minority communities are excluded and falling behind.",6161
positive,"Therefore, it is very positive that 100% of CBSR facilitators interviewed are bilingual in the local language as well as Lao.",6162

neutral,"In addition to their age, the very fact of being displaced – often without  documentation, and unable to speak the language of their destination – combined with  economic need increases vulnerability to abuse and exploitation and, often, xenophobic  discrimination (ibid.).",6240
neutral,"Many of these risks vary by age and gender, with boys and girls  facing different levels and types of risks in terms of violence, trafficking, child labour  and child marriage (United Nations, 2019), while children and adolescents with disabil- ities, and adolescents and youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/ questioning/intersex (LGBTQI) face discrimination that overlays and intersects with these  risks.",6241
neutral,"Moreover, children who move on their own often lack safe and regular options to  reunite with family members (UNICEF, n.d.).",6242
neutral,The context and nature of movement affects these risks.,6243
neutral,"For example, migrants in transit  are exposed to sexual and gender-based violence (GBV), forced labour, extortion and  exploitation, among other abuses (IOM, 2020); while economic deprivation among  refugees and internally displaced people increases the likelihood of engagement in  hazardous or exploitative child labour and, in some contexts, of forced and early child  marriage (United Nations, 2019).",6244

neutral,"It does not include evidence on system reforms, which typically reported  positive shifts along with evidence qualifying or explaining outcomes.",6282
positive,"All 16 studies of national-level policy or legal reform processes indicated progress, even  if reforms were not complete at the time of evaluation, given the slow pace of change  and factors leading to delays such as leadership changes or administrative reforms. ",6283
neutral,"These reforms related primarily to the protection of refugee children in emergency situa- tions, anti-trafficking laws and policies, and the protection of child migrants (often child  labourers), usually in more stable contexts.",6284
positive,"In the short-to-medium term, government  agencies were able to overcome obstacles by incorporating these progressive reforms  into their ways of working.",6285
positive,Existing motivation or attitudinal shifts on the part of govern- ment officials resulting from participation in policy reform projects or training were  key drivers of change.,6286
positive,"Linkages between countries’ regular national systems, structures  and projects on child protection and national and international efforts around human- itarian/refugee responses helped ensure that children on the move were protected by  national-level institutions as well as humanitarian actors.",6287
positive,"The 18 studies of community-based child protection mechanisms in refugee camps,  post-emergency contexts with significant numbers of internally displaced children, and  in communities with high levels of child migration and trafficking found that where they  had a sense of ownership and collective responsibility, they were effective in chal- lenging entrenched interests to address child protection violations. ",6288
negative,"These mechanisms  were often hampered by lack of operational budgets, declining motivation of volunteers,  and a perceived lack of follow-up action after referral, which undermined ongoing  commitment in three cases. ",6289
neutral,"24 studies reported on workforce strengthening initiatives, with most focusing on the  training of social workers or police across all contexts and in relation to the protec- tion of all types of children on the move.",6290
positive,These studies found positive increases in  knowledge or skills in 11 cases and mixed findings (change among some groups or  on some indicators) in five.,6291
positive,"Training was most effective when sustained over time,  repeated frequently to take account of staff turnover, and when carried out alongside  wider system-strengthening efforts (including operational budgets) that enabled staff  to put new learning into practice.",6292
positive,Tailoring training to post-holders’ roles and involving  decision-makers as well as frontline staff also increased trainees’ ability to implement  new practices.,6293
positive,"Seven studies, almost all conducted in communities with high levels of migration and  trafficking, found positive change in children’s knowledge of migration and trafficking  risks and/or in their intention to migrate using safe pathways; one found no change. ",6294
positive,"Effective initiatives used good quality information-sharing and behaviour change  methods, with multiple information, education and communication (IEC) materials,  community conversations, and messages delivered by trusted facilitators or public  figures. ",6295
negative,These were insufficient to deter unsafe migration among adolescents living  in poverty or communities with high levels of violence.,6296
positive,"Most of the 13 studies of cash transfers provided to refugees found mixed impacts on  child protection outcomes, with some evidence of an association between improvements  in living conditions and reduced financial stress, better psychosocial well-being for  adults and children, and reduced violence against children.",6297
positive,"Evidence on their impact on  child labour was mixed, though more studies found cash transfers lead to a reduction in  children working than the opposite.",6298
positive,A small number of studies suggested that receiving  cash for longer periods (more than 12 months) and combining cash with other child  protection activities/services achieved better protection outcomes.,6299
negative,"The studies reviewed found little evidence that skills training is particularly effective in  reducing protection violations, such as child labour or trafficking amongst refugees or in  communities with high levels of migration and trafficking.",6300

positive,"In gender-based  violence (GBV)-focused projects, effective interventions directly raised awareness of  harmful norms, and engaged men as partners in change rather than perpetrators only. ",6305
positive,"Interventions with opportunities for dialogue, exchange of experiences and reflection  among parents (e.g. family-based sessions, support groups, mental health sessions),  and those that involved joint parent and child sessions and provided opportunities to  practice new skills, were identified as contributing to effectiveness.",6306
positive,"Some studies also  suggested that offering multi-sectoral support (including medical, psychosocial, rein- tegration, legal, case management, etc.) contributed to interventions’ effectiveness.",6307
positive,"Activities that included refugees/IDPs and host communities (training, awareness-raising  sessions, implementation of communal projects) show some evidence of improved  community cohesion. ",6308
positive,"11 studies reported a decrease in child labour, while eight found no change. These  interventions targeted refugee and migrant child workers, usually in host communities. ",6309
positive,Interventions reporting improvements tended to have a clear focus on combating child  labour. ,6310
neutral,"They typically involved simultaneous activities such as child protection surveil- lance, advocacy on policy/legal reforms, workforce strengthening, awareness-raising  or educational support.",6311
negative,Livelihoods components were generally ineffective. ,6312
positive,Thirty-three studies examined impacts on the care of children on the move of which  28 reported positive shifts and ten reported no change on at least one indicator.,6313
neutral,"The  majority of initiatives focused on reunification of unaccompanied and separated chil- dren in emergencies, and on alternative care arrangements for child refugees and  asylum-seekers in more stable contexts.",6314
positive,"Interventions that provided effective family  tracing and reunification services focused on strengthening workforce capacity  and case management systems, and community surveillance capacity, which led to  improved identification of cases.",6315
positive,Training and financial support for foster families  proved successful in strengthening emergency foster care for separated children in crisis  contexts.,6316
positive,Limited evidence indicates that group therapy and efforts to build trust and  relax security measures may reduce ‘disappearances’ from reception facilities into more  harmful situations. ,6317
positive,The REA found tentative evidence that boosting caregivers’ psycho- social well-being through direct interventions and economic-strengthening support  enhanced their capacity to care for children.,6318
neutral,"The studies in this REA reported on a range of psychosocial interventions such as  creative arts, play, group therapy, and counselling, the majority of which were provided  through safe/child-friendly spaces in refugee or IDP camps, and/or host communities. ",6319

positive,"Psycho-education, cognitive behavioural therapy, and joint sessions for youth  from refugee, migrant and host communities (including community planning) helped  children build resilience, improved integration, and increased their hope for the future.",6322
positive,The studies examined in this REA highlighted a number of factors that contributed to  positive outcomes. ,6323
positive,"These included: • A supportive political environment for policy and system reforms, and a supportive  policy environment for community-level initiatives.",6324
positive,"Ownership of initiatives – at national level, by politicians and civil servants who felt  a mandate to drive reform, and at local level, by community stakeholders such as  local leaders, teachers, community child protection networks and focal points, and  youth committees. ",6326
positive,"System-strengthening activities, such as workforce training programmes, highlighted the importance of sufficient funding in other elements of child protection and associated services to ensure that referrals and case management lead to children at risk of harm being supported.",6328
positive,Work across different levels of the socio-ecological model with effective relationships between different agencies and actors.,6330
positive,"Evaluations generally praised initiatives that worked at policy, system and local level, and with multiple actors and agencies, which had the potential to achieve a greater overall impact and to achieve more sustainable change.",6331
negative,"To do so, direct activities need to be replicable and systems for learning lessons put in place so they can inform policy. ",6332
neutral,"This was most common with child labour and trafficking initiatives, as well as in some safe migration programmes.",6333
positive,"Skilled and committed staff and volunteers were critical, particularly in initiatives working directly with children, where ability to develop rapport was essential.",6334
positive,"Evaluations also highlighted the importance of facilitators having good communica- tion skills, and the value of training in specialist skills such as psychosocial care.",6335
negative,"Factors hampering positive impacts included: • Overambitious goals for relatively short projects, particularly for initiatives that aimed to change deeply entrenched norms (e.g., around GBV or violence against children) or to develop alternatives to child labour.",6336
negative,"Insufficient cultural grounding, which led to missed opportunities for designing and implementing effective initiatives.",6337
negative,"Discriminatory gender norms which, particularly in contexts of insecurity, limited girls’ access to opportunities such as safe spaces.",6338
negative,"Challenging socioeconomic contexts, resulting from high levels of unemployment and poverty, or restrictions on refugees’ right to work, undermined efforts to strengthen livelihoods as a means of addressing child protection violations among children on the move. ",6339
negative,"The studies reviewed made little comment on how these challenging contexts could be addressed, beyond measures to support refugee adults’ right to work.",6340
neutral,"In 32 initiatives that focused on strengthening child protection systems, system reform was at the core of the intervention.",6341
neutral,"These initiatives worked mainly with ministries of  social welfare (most commonly), the police and justice system, and labour departments.",6342
negative,"Initiatives working with border or immigration departments were much less common,  and the studies of these initiatives generally did not report on their linkages with social  welfare or other child protection agencies. ",6343
neutral,A total of 40 studies reported activities linked  to social welfare or child protection systems.,6344
neutral,"This was most common in multi-component  initiatives working at different levels (e.g., direct services to families and children, or  workforce training).",6345
neutral,"Linkages to the social welfare system were the most common,  followed by specialist child/youth services (sometimes with a specific mandate related  to migrant or refugee children), and the police or justice system.",6346
neutral,Only three initiatives  worked with schools to strengthen protection of children.3,6347
negative,"MHPSS initiatives, social and  behavior change communication (SBCC) aimed at violence prevention, and cash trans- fers were more likely to be run as standalone activities with limited reported linkages to  social welfare or child protection systems. ",6348
negative,Several cross-cutting gaps and weaknesses emerge from our analysis:  • Lack of counterfactual. ,6349
negative, Relatively few  studies compared impacts on participants and non-participants or reported substan- tial reflection on how far findings were attributable to project activity.,6350
negative,This is an  important limitation in terms of understanding ‘what works’. ,6351
negative,Limited quantitative data on the scale of change. ,6352
neutral,"Although many studies used mixed  methods, the quantitative data involved largely comes from project reports.",6353
negative,"Few  studies present data on the scale of change (effect sizes), and of those that do, few  discuss whether changes were statistically significant.",6354
positive,"Despite this, many of the quan- titative studies (for example, of violence prevention) shows large-scale changes in  attitudes or reported behaviour, of up to 30 percentage points.",6355
neutral,"Understanding the relative impact of different activities in multi-component initiatives,  and of multiple activities compared to single activity initiatives.",6356
negative,No RCTs compared  the relative impact of different activities.,6357

neutral,"Understanding which interventions have lasting effects, and why.",6359
neutral,"Given the tight time frame for this assignment, we did not focus on the analysis of lasting effects.",6360
positive,"That said, our tentative findings suggest that livelihood interventions achieved some lasting impact on skills, even if participants were not always able to generate substantial incomes with those skills.",6361
neutral,Studies undertaken in emergency contexts were often ‘real-time’ evaluations undertaken to improve implementation and so were not oriented to examining the longevity of impacts.,6362
neutral,"Assessments of policy and legal reform typically reported on whether new laws or policies had been developed, or international or inter-departmental coordination strengthened.",6363
negative,They did not examine the impact of these changes on the lives of the children or families they were intended to benefit.,6364
negative,. Interviews with child protection specialists in the four commissioning agencies highlighted a lag between on-the-ground innovation and documentation and analysis of impact.,6365
negative,"The studies reviewed here reflect this delay, which means that emerging approaches are under-represented.",6366
negative,We also observed a number of specific gaps.,6367
negative,"Some of the most striking are as follows: • Context-related emphases (few studies of protection of children on the move in the wake of disaster-related displacement, compared to conflict-related displacement).",6368
negative,"Gaps related to specific aspects of migration or refugee journeys (no studies reported on efforts to provide protection to children in transit, and only three reported on initiatives with returnees; very few reported on the effects of reforms on children’s experiences at borders).",6369
negative,"Gaps related to social groups (very few studies specifically mentioned children with disabilities, or LGBTQI adolescents and young people). ",6370
negative,"Few explicitly mentioned working with ethnic or religious minorities, though we believe these numbers were under-reported, given that minorities are often particularly affected by conflict and thus likely to be displaced. ",6371

neutral,Evidence on what works to reduce specific protection violations.,6376
neutral,"The mostly commonly reported outcomes were in the areas of psychosocial wellbeing, violence against children, and care of unaccompanied children.",6377
negative,Relatively few studies reported on changes in child marriage or protection from trafficking.,6378
negative,"Other than a few initiatives that intentionally engaged young people as change agents, few studies discussed how children’s perspectives had been incorporated into project design or implemen- tation, or how their views were taken into account in processes designed to protect them. ",6379
negative,"We did not seek studies probing these issues, which may account for their under-representation, but were struck by this gap while analyzing insights.",6380

positive,"A great deal has been learned  from this work, including through the FGE.",6633
negative,But the  limited scope for impact in comparison to opera- tional work at the meso- and macro-levels suggests  that the time has come to revise the approach:  micro-level work needs to sit within a bigger picture  and contribute evidence towards shifting structural  bottlenecks to WEE. ,6634
negative,UN women should be highly  selective in its micro-level work and focus strongly  on how it will provide evidence and data about  structural barriers to women’s realization of their  economic and social rights.,6635

",6756
positive,"Furthermore, the regional architecture increased UN  Women ability to include civil society organizations  (CSOs) representing women, including the most  vulnerable women, in decision-making platforms at  higher levels, but it also challenged UN Women to  modify its way of engaging with women’s groups  because it now has to provide increased attention to  government stakeholders.",6757

positive,"Alongside major global events and multi-stakeholder meetings, other activities undertaken by the  GCM/NCD in support of its role in advocacy, awareness-raising, disseminating knowledge and sharing  information included development of the Knowledge Action Portal, live webinars, communities of  practice, working groups and research connect. ",7450
negative,"While the Knowledge Action Portal clearly has the  potential to be a valuable tool for sharing knowledge and best practice and was widely appreciated  by civil society organizations, evidence suggests that further effort is needed to improve its reach to,  and relevance at, the regional and country levels.

There is scope for greater engagement between WHO and  civil society, for example to ensure that the NCD-GAP is implemented in ways which promote key NCD-GAP principles  relating to human rights, equity and empowerment of people and communities. United Nations agencies and other multilateral organizations globally, regionally and nationally are able to engage with  aspects of the NCD-GAP which require multisectoral engagement and may be beyond the mandate and reach of WHO.  Their approach is captured in the 2019 document “Stronger Collaboration, Better Health” 1 which presents a global action  plan to accelerate country progress on the health-related SDGs. There are many examples of United Nations agencies  engaging in this way, internationally, regionally and in countries. However, more still needs to be done, particularly in  countries where the United Nations country team sees NCDs as largely a health issue for WHO. While many academic and government research institutions are actively conducting research related to NCDs, there is  little sense of this being coordinated by or contributing to the implementation of the NCD-GAP. While there are isolated  incidences of support to national research capacity, there is scope for this to be done much more systematically.

neutral,"In order to ensure the most effective and rational utilisation of NPOs, WHO must understand the  specific role that NPOs play within the Organization, the value NPOs currently add in WHO Country  Offices and the potential impact that NPOs can make in the future.",7990
neutral,"There had, however, not been  any systematic evaluation of this role to date. ",7991
neutral,"The WHO-wide evaluation work plan for 2018-2019, approved by the 142nd session of the Executive  Board, required an evaluation of the utilisation of NPOs at the country level.",7992
neutral,The purpose of the  evaluation was to assess the role played by NPOs in WHO offices in terms of the effective delivery  of WHO’s mandate at country level in support of Member States to achieve their national health  targets.,7993
neutral,"The evaluation was framed around four key questions, as set out below.",7994
neutral,How relevant is the current role played by NPOs in fulfilling WHO’s mandate at the country level? ,7995
neutral,What are the specific contributions and added value of NPOs in countries in relation to achieving results at country level? ,7996
neutral,What are the main overlaps and complementarities between the roles of NPOs and International Professionals (IPs) in countries?,7997
neutral,"As WHO moves towards more focused and effective country-based operations, what is the future role of NPOs? What skills and competencies are required for this role? ",7998
neutral,"Throughout the evaluation, care was taken to consider the impact of gender as a crosscutting dimension within the analysis of the NPO role.",7999
neutral,"A multi-dimensional evaluation was conducted, including two online surveys (one with NPOs and a  second with their supervisors), interviews and focus group discussions involving WHO staff,  managers, partners and Ministry of Health (MoH) representatives. ",8000
neutral,"There were also site visits to  India, Nigeria, and Senegal, and a quantitative human resources (HR) and financial analysis based on  Global Management System (GSM) and data from the electronic Performance Management and  Development System (ePMDS).",8001
neutral,HOW RELEVANT IS THE CURRENT ROLE PLAYED BY NPOS IN FULFILLING WHO’S MANDATE AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL?,8002
neutral,The relevance of NPO staff in fulfilling WHO’s mandate can be assessed through multiple lenses:  • As a proportion of staff at country level: NPOs represent 15% of WHO’s workforce. ,8003
neutral,"This is slightly above the UN average, but the actual figure varies from one agency to the next.",8004
neutral,"Some 90% of WHO NPOs operate at country level, where they represent 27% of WHO country level staff. ",8005
neutral,"Moreover, 5% of NPOs are also found at Regional Office (RO) level and the remaining 5% essentially in the Global Service Centre (GSC) under the HQ Major Office.",8006
neutral,In terms of the experience and expertise they bring: The NPO age distribution is similar to that across WHO and their tenure at WHO is not markedly different to that of IPs.,8007
neutral,"NPOs typically have high academic achievements and previous work experience, often in their home country’s MoH. ",8008
neutral,"In terms of their contribution to a variety of WHO programmatic outcomes and outputs: NPOs work across a wide range of categories, most notably Communicable Diseases (for 28% of NPOs) and Polio Eradication (for 19% of NPOs).",8009
neutral,"The programmatic focus varies greatly from one Country Office to the next, however.",8010
positive,"In terms of the function they fulfil: At country level NPOs play a key role in facilitating policy implementation, capacity-building and monitoring activities, whereas they fulfil enabling services and corporate functions at RO and HQ major office levels.",8011
positive,"With regard to the relevance of the role itself as defined by the ICSC, the evaluation found that  WHO practice in using NPOs has evolved since the creation of the role.",8012
neutral,"n a number of respects, current practice constitutes a departure from the eligibility criteria.",8013
neutral,"Although similar inconsistencies  with the ICSC eligibility criteria exist in other UN agencies, this departure questions whether the role  as defined by the ICSC is fit for purpose to meet WHO’s objectives.",8014
negative,"In analysis of NPO demographics as part of this evaluation question, the evaluation noted that there  is lower female representation amongst NPOs than there is among IPs (37% vs 45%), and the NPO  gender parity varies across regions and programmes. ",8015
neutral,WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS AND ADDED VALUE OF NPOS IN COUNTRIES IN RELATION TO ACHIEVING RESULTS AT COUNTRY LEVEL? ,8016
positive,"NPOs are deemed to make a unique contribution to WHO, providing specific value-add in support  of WHO operations.",8017
positive,"They can be considered in many cases to be a cost-effective resource solution,  although there are constraints and limitations on how they can be utilised.",8018
positive,"The unique contributions of NPO staff, asidentified by stakeholders, can be classified into seven key attributes: language; cultural fit; geographical knowledge and access; institutional knowledge of the country’s health system; network within MoH, government and society at large; continuity of presence in a country; and social proximity to national health outcomes: translated into a specific commitment and dedication to the role. ",8019
positive,"These attributes provide a potential value-add in terms of service orientation towards the MoH, access to key national health forums, access to affected populations and areas, situational awareness and relevance, and an overall ability to tailor WHO’s response to the country context.",8020
positive,"Overall, this contributes to improving WHO’s overall effectiveness and impact at country level.",8021
neutral,"The cost-effectiveness of the NPO role was assessed in terms of: (1) the NPO role’s work content relative to the grade requirements, and (2) cost relative to equivalent positions in a country. ",8022
positive,"NPOs perform tasks that are beyond those defined in the Master Standard for the classification of Professionals, at a cost that was consistently found to be significantly less than the equivalent IP role.",8023
negative,"However, the evaluation also showed that the NPO salaries are significantly higher than local salaries for comparable jobs, which can create inadequate incentives for NPOs to return to their previous employers or pursue mobility outside of WHO. ",8024
negative,"There are also considerations for and restrictions on the utilisation of the NPO role, notably relating to: o the need for clear boundaries between the MoH and WHO; o the perceived credibility of NPOs in the eyes of the MoH; o the importance of bringing fresh thinking to WHO and the MoH, which a long tenure and lack of international exposure might not provide; o the importance for WHO to maintain its global, multilateral nature; o the duty of care for staff in security compromised settings; and o the potential attrition of talent (“brain drain”), although this issue is not specific to the NPO role. ",8025
neutral,WHAT ARE THE MAIN OVERLAPS AND COMPLEMENTARITIES BETWEEN THE ROLES OF NPOS AND IPS IN COUNTRY OFFICES?,8026
neutral,"There are areas of overlap between the roles of NPOs and IPs, which have emerged organically.",8027
positive,"It is  possible that some level of overlap is advantageous, alongside the key areas of complementarity  that these roles offer.",8028
neutral,The arbitration of these roles should be guided by a clear framework based on WHO’s operational resource needs.,8029
negative,"However, in the absence of such guidance the choice is typically based on judgement and on budgetary considerations.",8030
negative,"This represents a considerable risk, given the constraints on NPO utilisation and the lost opportunities to optimise the resource solution for WHO’s needs. ",8031
positive,"There are notable complementarities between the NPO and IP roles in countries, which highlight the benefits of a mixed-resource model and collaborative working between staff groups. ",8032
positive,"There is more permeability between staff roles(GS and those on Special Service Agreements, or SSAs, NPO and IP) than originally anticipated by ICSC, despite WHO policies thus far being relatively restrictive of such transitions as well as the absence of systematic WHO-wide facilitation of such moves.",8033
neutral,"AS WHO MOVES TOWARDS MORE FOCUSED AND EFFECTIVE COUNTRY-BASED OPERATIONS, WHAT IS THE FUTURE ROLE OF NPOS? WHAT SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS ROLE? ",8034
positive,"NPOs have a key role to play in WHO’s future, as WHO pursues more focus on country-level impact.",8035
negative,"In  order to realise the potential of this part of the workforce and deliver sustainable contributions to WHO’s role in improving national health outcomes, the NPO role and its requisite skills and  competencies will need to evolve, overcoming organisational barriers and leveraging management  enablers. ",8036
negative,"An analysis of WHO policy instruments identified five relevant factors that should shape the nature and ways of working in WHO Country Offices (WCOs): 1) WCOs are pivotal in demonstrating results orientation and accountability; 2) WHO’s role and WCO presence should be tailored to specific country needs and priorities; nonetheless, 3) some crosscutting needs can be identified to strengthen the WHO’s response in areas of priority; 4) in a context of reform and transformation, WCOs need more capabilities in the areas of external and internal collaboration, coordination and integration; and 5) WCOs are essential in promoting principles- based approaches. ",8037
neutral,"These five drivers, which affect the future of WCOs, have implications for the NPO roles, skills and competencies.",8038
positive,"The changing job profile requirements were corroborated by NPOs, NPO supervisors and WRs, although there were differences in the perspectives of the NPOs and NPO supervisors regarding the relative importance of improvements in specific areas of skills.",8039
negative,"NPOs have the potential to contribute significantly to the changing context of the WCOs, e.g. in tailoring WHO’s response to country-specific needs, but some adaptation is required if the NPO role’s strengths are to remain relevant and role limitations are to be mitigated.",8040
neutral,People management and HR practices present both barriers and opportunities for the optimisation of the NPO workforce segment.,8041
negative,Recruitment can be improved to ensure the right mix of competencies and candidates.,8042
negative,"Whilst there are positive practices in promoting diversity and inclusion, a continued focus is needed in this area.",8043
negative,Performance management is a key challenge for WHO and professional development could hold the key to addressing it.,8044
negative,There are opportunities to review and strengthen career progression and mobility practices specifically for this part of the workforce.,8045
positive,"There are mixed views about the best training and development approaches; however, the growing practice of short-term assignments outside the home country seems particularly beneficial.",8046
negative,Performance management is not well utilised currently; it is not leveraged to build on high performance or used to addresslow performance.,8047
negative,"“enabling environment” for NPOs, with some potential to review the experience of “fairness” and equal opportunities.",8048
neutral,Eight main reasons were given to explain reluctance to move: “family/spouse  considerations” (81%); “no suitable positions for my professional profile” (59%); “higher security risks”  (57%); “low or less attractive living conditions in general” (51%); lack of promotion opportunities”  (48%); “limited education/schooling options” (46%); “limited health care options” (42%); and “lower  financial entitlements/allowances” (38%).,8064
