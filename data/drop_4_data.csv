16,"Furthermore, the training of facilitators and longer term engagement was inadequate; the ongoing provision of free inputs to demonstration farmers was questionable; the programme gave limited emphasis to environmentally sustainable agricultural techniques; and targeted support for the poor and landless was lacking.",negative,16
17,"However, there was continued provision of free inputs under project 011 beyond the time period within which this was justified.",negative,17
18,Partnerships with government were stronger at local level than at national level and this may have compromised the capacity of the project to influence the wider policy and enabling environment.,negative,18

20,"There was an intentional shift of focus (agreed between the Department of Fisheries and project management) to fisheries co-management in an area where opportunities for mangrove co-management were very limited; but this shift was not reflected in a revised logframe, and rendered the original logframe largely irrelevant as a project management and monitoring and evaluation tool.",negative,20

22,"Project 010 was implemented in a geographic area wherein the original rationale and logic could not apply, and the focus was shifted from mangrove co-management to fisheries co- management.",negative,22
23,The theory of change of 012 was weak and this was reflected in some ad hoc interventions and a lack of strategy in implementation.,negative,23

84,"Apart from engagement with global initiatives using the IPC, such as the Global Report on Food Crises, the GSP has provided limited support for utilization of the IPC.",negative,84
85,Factors negatively affecting its usefulness include: the geographic unit of analysis being too large and therefore insufficient granularity of analysis; limited availability of data and poor quality data; political sensitivity of the results; and the challenge of translating the results into recommendations.,negative,85
86,Much more follow-up support at country level is needed.,negative,86

605,There was some loss in programming efficiency because of delays in the placement of REACH facilitators in all countries.,negative,605
606,In neither case was there a specific cost analysis to address these perceptions.,negative,606
607,"Also noted were the need for a more strategic and cross- sectoral REACH steering committee, stronger induction and support to facilitators during start-up, and clarity with regard to country-level processes.",negative,607
608,Most global stakeholders knew little about REACH.,negative,608
609,"However, there are limitations to applying a standard model that is not sufficiently attuned to local realities, under tight timeframes.",negative,609
610,"However, there has been an element of overshadowing by the SUN movement, which has contributed to REACH being relatively less known and understood.",negative,610
611,"The REACH theory of change did not take sufficient account of factors from outcome to impact level, such as the importance of high-level political commitment from governments, the political economy of the United Nations, and the lack of clear accountability and incentives for support within the United Nations.",negative,611
612,"In a crowded global landscape, the existence of REACH continues to be questioned by some nutrition actors.",negative,612
613,There has been insufficient attention to the effects on the SUN movement when REACH ends.,negative,613
614,The validity of the REACH theory of change is challenged by major assumptions from the outcome to the impact levels.9,negative,614
615,"In particular, collaboration among United Nations agencies at the levels required for bringing about the envisioned changes was consistently weak, in part because of an absence of incentives for collaboration.",negative,615
616,The intended two-to three-year year catalytic phase of REACH was insufficient.,negative,616
617,"Given the support that REACH has provided to SUN at the country level, strong concerns were expressed that SUN will likely be affected by the transitioning of REACH to new modalities, especially if facilitator positions are discontinued.",negative,617
618,The achievements and weaknesses of REACH reflect the quality of its design and implementation.,negative,618
619,"AO has been unable to provide a sufficiently clear explanation of why EMPRES is the best approach to TPDs and FSTs across all components, which have had implications at the level of results.",negative,619
620,"The rapid onset of emergency response initiatives was less sensitive to gender dimensions, which probably reflects the pressing need to focus on the rapid onset of disease outbreaks or threats during an emergency.",negative,620
621,This reliance has coincided with a reduction in the breadth and depth of donor funding.,negative,621
622,The newer and relatively poorly funded and under-staffed components (forest health and aquatic animal health) tended to focus on preparedness and response activities.,negative,622
623,These cuts have resulted in reduced in-house expertise in many priority areas for EMPRES approaches.,negative,623
624,The capacity to deliver EMPRES components continues to be reduced and is insufficient to meet demand.,negative,624
625,FIS performance has remained behind with regard to the livestock sector.,negative,625
626,"In order to optimize the contribution of AFIS outputs towards decision making, the FSC is to be further empowered and the Food Security Technical Secretariat (FSTS) needs to be moved from the NBS to the FSC Secretariat.",negative,626

628,The use of AFIS limited resources needs to be prioritized.,negative,628
629,Data generated is not adequately disaggregated by gender.,negative,629
630,Information systems are not yet ready to be run solely by government which needs continuing capacity development.,negative,630
631,"However, some constraints still exist at the national level in relation to institutional readiness, resulting in the delayed implementation of technical and operational management decisions.",negative,631

637,"A more active role that includes work and engagement on the ground with potential new partners, namely the private sector and the NGO sector, will be instrumental in sustaining the new biennial CPF consolidating the work in motion.",negative,637
638,"This is due to a lack of resources, but also to the fact that the Country Office failed to take an active position on these topics.",negative,638
639,"At the same time, this effort at alignment remains quite formal, and is less evident at the project level.",negative,639
640,"However, the format of the document and the process through which it was produced could be improved, and its goals remain too ambitious.",negative,640
641,"FAO rarely provided direct technical assistance for other agencies, and was sometimes perceived as not being able to play an advocacy role on sensitive but important issues.",negative,641
642,"Most of them were promoted through regional projects, which were often developed with only limited input from the country office.",negative,642
643,"However, there was room for further strengthening of partnerships, particularly those just beginning with civil society and the private sector.",negative,643
644,"However, most activities concentrated on training individuals rather than addressing the organisational capacity or creating an enabling environment.",negative,644
645,"Staff has not been systematically briefed or trained on the topic, and what was aimed to be achieved in this aspect was unclear.",negative,645
646,"There were too many projects that were too small, and this affected efficiency and potentially wider impacts.",negative,646
647,This inevitably affected the quality of its work.,negative,647
648,"The design of some projects and activities was not informed by a strong understanding of the context and lacked a corresponding theory of change to bring about longer term, more significant changes.",negative,648
649,"The total output was rather limited, however, which was compounded by gaps in dissemination and the lack of a proper communication strategy.",negative,649
650,"FAO focused largely on support at the national level, although there was a greater need for support at the provincial and district levels.",negative,650
651,"Generally, the work to support changes at the Government level was more successful than the work aimed to make an impact in the field.",negative,651
652,"For emergency operations, this was consistent with the findings of previous evaluations.",negative,652
653,"Finally, there are key areas of work in which FAO provided critical support and has a great potential to continue playing a central support role, but where opportunities were missed.",negative,653
654,Project implementation at the community level was found to be less than optimal.,negative,654
655,"However, project outcomes could have been improved by involving other partners in supporting a self-sustained network of nutrition educators at an earlier stage.",negative,655
656,"In the case of ENAF, a large proportion of the delay came as a consequence of the delays faced by ENACT.",negative,656
657,The disproportionally large input of FAO HQ- based consultants may not have been the most efficient solution.,negative,657
658,"As a result of the large number of activities and time delays, and the subsequent partial achievement of the outputs, the last two outcomes (in which the professional community and government advocacy activities would have created an enabling environment) were only achieved to a limited extent.",negative,658
659,The lack of engagement with government and limited employment opportunities for students (which was left out as an assumption) will further hinder this contribution.,negative,659
660,"As a result, the only potential effect on gender equality was unintended, namely the increase of attractiveness of nutrition studies to future male students.",negative,660
661,"Although adoption of the course in pilot universities seems likely at this time, more effort is needed to anchor ENACT approaches within organizations.",negative,661
662,"This resulted in missed opportunities for linking to governments and communities, scaling up, and enabling a lasting impact.",negative,662
663,"However, the project did not foresee any activities that could lead to better employment opportunities or the application of the acquired knowledge by students.",negative,663
664,"Gender equality and the inclusion of women were not sufficiently included in the project design or implementation, and no gender analysis was conducted.",negative,664
665,"At a number of points, it has emerged that ILO constituents at national level often lack capacity, sometimes interest, in the area of extending the social protection floor.",negative,665
666,"Internally, this will probably involve introducing changes to the current configuration of technical support in the various programmes linking it to employment policy development with the aim of improving the coherence of ILO policy messages at country level.",negative,666
667,Repeated assistance to countries under the same outcome indicator and country programme activities under overlapping outcome indicators do not adequately reflect the support and progress being made within the broader policy cycle.,negative,667
668,"However, the reciprocal support could be reinforced to achieve a clearer understanding of the services and tools that are required to meet the conditions set out in the Convention.",negative,668
669,This is partly due to national budgetary constraints and internal government coordination issues.,negative,669
670,Country case studies show that this is not automatic and situations can arise where specific groups end up in disadvantageous situations.,negative,670
671,"However, the ILO should improve the impact and sustainability of its strategy and capacity by articulating a longer term vision of how countries can support employment policies through all stages of the employment policy cycle.",negative,671
672,"The existing indicator framework for the strategic objective on employment does not support clear understanding of country-level outcomes, achievements and progress within broader ILO employment policy initiatives, which may reinforce internal fragmentation.",negative,672
673,The impact of this programme at this stage at national level therefore remains potential rather than actual.,negative,673
674,On the other hand the programme has in several instances worked at arms length with some of the departments concerned.,negative,674
675,At present it is not clear who outside of the Office has right of access to what.,negative,675
676,There is a risk that a considerable amount of dedicated work will be wasted and the intellectual capital in which the ILO has invested will be squandered.,negative,676
677,External donors to the programme appear to not have been demanding in their monitoring expectations.,negative,677
678,"For example a flagship publication7 put out in September 2004 was issued as a SES product rather than an ILO-endorsed set of policies, however, with little clarity as to why this distinction was being made.",negative,678
679,"There is little evidence, however, that much of the analytical work has been converted into actionable policy recommendations.",negative,679
680,"Furthermore, an innovative5 programme, exploring issues of potentially great importance for the ILO, has been run without any visible monitoring system to show how the innovation was evolving in the light of experience, and to inform senior management about consequent developments.",negative,680
681,"Interaction with the International Advisory Board, set up at the outset to help the programme appears to have flagged after several years6 .",negative,681
682,At this moment the programme appears to have lost momentum within the ILO and to be on the verge of dissolution.,negative,682
683,"There is little evidence that the management system of the ILO provided the supervision necessary to monitor and give feedback on this largely exploratory research programme, or to attenuate the tensions that may arise between a unit that is potentially redefining organisational practice and the ways that existing programmes and units may be expected to work in the future.",negative,683
684,"However, while the findings should not necessarily be generalized to the entire portfolio of technical cooperation (TC) projects, case studies indicate that ILO assistance is not always directed toward key issues that: impinge on the ability of the labour inspectorates to carry out their duties and enforce the law, such as the limitations of the central authority; limit the capacity of courts to adjudicate cases; lack effective mechanisms for collecting penalties; and lack robust case management systems, and reliable labour inspection statistics.",negative,684
685,"However, some aspects of design could be improved primarily with respect to the scope of engagements and sequencing of activities.",negative,685
686,"From a broader institutional perspective, while the Office has established planning and control systems, some deficiencies are apparent.",negative,686
687,"In interviews conducted as part of this evaluation, constituents offered different assessments of progress on compliance.",negative,687
688,While ILO seeks to support member States in keeping with international standards as reflected in Conventions Nos.,negative,688
689,"Howe- ver, the likelihood that improvements in the capacity of labour inspectorates will be sustained varies across countries depending on the extent to which changes have been codified in policies, procedures and systems as well as the degree of political commitment, institutional leadership, and ongoing budget support.",negative,689
690,"However, results vary across countries and lack of consistent data limit analysis.",negative,690
691,There are several reasons for this: a professional and cultural divide between the development staff implementing programmes and the lawyers in the NORMES Department with weak incentives to work together more coherently; an almost total preoccupation in terms of work load with the supervisory system by staff in the NORMES Department; difficulties by staff in other technical areas in understanding the legal processes of ILS; and continued difficulties (in some programme areas more than others) in integrating ILS into Technical Cooperation.,negative,691
692,"However, this and other outward looking activities of the Office are curtailed principally by the overwhelming attention given to servicing the supervisory system.",negative,692
693,Making the links between ILO support and satisfactory outcomes will always be an imperfect science.,negative,693
694,"However, this is where the implementation of ILS outside the formal sector must make progress if they are to benefit a large proportion of the population.",negative,694
695,One must recognize that the resources of the Office are not sufficient for all of the mandates and actions it is requested to assume.,negative,695
696,"The evaluation concludes that across the Office, more work is required to satisfactorily mainstream the ILS.",negative,696
697,Some means of generating more field experience and understanding of field conditions among NORMES Department staff would bring benefits overall to TC programming and to the efficiency of the supervisory system.,negative,697
698,"The challenge to coordinate the technical cooperation and integration of ILS, identified more than twenty years ago, still remains.",negative,698
699,Extending the ILS into the informal economy is a considerable challenge with none of the modalities proposed by the Office so far making great headway.,negative,699
700,This occurs despite some inconsistencies in high-level strategy statements orienting action towards the gaps identified through supervisory mechanisms.,negative,700
701,"However, as long as the FPRW outcomes are mirrored in separate organizational units, the 2008 Declaration's policy call for synergy is the only overriding incentive for managers to blend and combine outcome-linked regular budget (RB) financing.",negative,701
702,These vary in depth and scope from project to project.,negative,702
703,"These linkages are not uniform and are not always monitored or acknowledged, but they either do occur or have the potential to occur.",negative,703
704,"There is no coherent strategic justification for the prioritization of different FPRW principles, nor should there be since ILO policy sees constituent demand as the main driver of DWCP content, despite the obligations in the 1998 Declaration.",negative,704
705,Positive developments reflecting the Office's support for improvements in the realization of FPRW may well occur at a level that is not suited to supervision in terms of ratified conventions.,negative,705
706,"Ratings in the evaluation's survey of office directors and constituents are more mixed, with some unsatisfactory levels.",negative,706
707,These efforts are constrained where P&B outcomes and RB resources that flow with them correspond with organizational units.,negative,707
708,"This assessment is very obvious when resources are presented in terms of outcomes 14, 15, 16 and 17.",negative,708
709,Collaboration is possible but is based on the pragmatic self-interest of the organizations involved.,negative,709
710,"On examination, it was found that not all global outcome strategies are oriented to the needs expressed by constituents globally or to the gaps identified through supervisory mechanisms.",negative,710
711,The country cases studies and survey results show mixed results in terms of the integration of FPRW principles into United Nations (UN) programming documents.,negative,711
712,Institutional factors are reported to limit real operational synergy and successful cases may be unique.,negative,712
713,"In fact, resources are being allocated to FPRW support but are not recognized as such because of the way projects are linked to CPOs.",negative,713
714,"There are clear imbalances in extra-budgetary resources, with those available for the elimination of child labour leading other FPRW categories, although child labour has attracted substantially less resources in recent years.",negative,714
715,"Currently, global products are infrequently used as a mechanism for improving efficiency, i.e. providing common FPRW support to constituents globally",negative,715
716,"However, the fact that elements are developed individually to comply with monitoring requirements does not necessarily respond to this prerequisite, as it does not transmit the deeper understanding needed to strengthen sustainability.",negative,716
717,"However, no specific approach has been taken to the implementation of a plan as guided by the key elements specified in the ILC resolution in 2004, which calls for an Office-wide approach.",negative,717
718,"Moreover, it prevents the establishment of a common vision.",negative,718
719,"However, a common strategy for all sectors of the Office aimed at achieving the long-term objectives of the resolution has not been developed.",negative,719
720,To this end planning of specific activities for the implementation of the overall strategy or the sub-strategies would be needed.,negative,720

722,"ILC resolution, Programme and Budget reflecting the ILC conclusions on the need to mainstream activities and strengthen the International Migration Programme.",negative,722
723,"The consequence is that, despite continued regard for its expertise and confidence in its approach and tools, the ILO is not sufficiently present in operational activities in the field of international labour migration.",negative,723
724,There is a clear gap to be filled by a comprehensive Office-wide internal strategy paper that formally recognises the cross-cutting nature of the labour migration issue which requires a designation of responsibilities to all parts of the Office so that everyone is required to consider it in their work.,negative,724
725,"However, there is room for further cooperation with members of the GMG and other international and regional organizations.",negative,725
726,This seems to exclude the many other activities under the other 3 Strategic Objectives of the Office.,negative,726

730,Relevant international labour standards on migration are not well reflected in DWCPs according to analysis conducted by the evaluation team.,negative,730
731,Still there were a number of interview responses stating that ILO had lost a significant amount of ground in OSH-related global issues.,negative,731
732,Strong regional disparities should be considered as a factor in future prioritization processes (figure 3).,negative,732

735,"Only a few provided details on situational analysis, client and outcome analysis, identification of strategies and assumptions, management plans and implementation processes.",negative,735

737,"Howvere, measurability and quantification are better the closer they come to the implementation of Conventions, Recommendations and Protocols.",negative,737
738,Constituents and experts also noted a lack of resources and products relevant to middle- and low-income countries.,negative,738
739,"However, the information flows between project, field offices and headquarters are not clear and often dilute accountability for delivery.",negative,739
740,"Some of them, such as the OSH management guidelines, only show an impact years or even decades after their introduction.",negative,740
741,"As mentioned, for the 19 Conventions under the OSH heading (according to the website structure), 39 ratifications have been counted.",negative,741
742,"The ratification figures for Africa, the Arab States, and particularly Asia (represent 21% of all member States, and show only 7% of the OSH Conventions).",negative,742
743,Reliable data on occupational accidents and diseases are a necessary precondition for impact assessment and prioritization of OSH activities.,negative,743
744,Evidence gathered through this evaluation indicates that SafeWork could have improved the efficiency of OSH activities through better coordination and communication between field and headquarters staff and project management.,negative,744
745,"There are significant limitations in national-level data collection, monitoring systems, workplace-level awareness (particularly in under-served sectors such as agriculture, small businesses and the informal economy), and quality and reporting on inspections.",negative,745
746,An assessment of the immediate impact of SafeWork products and activities is difficult.,negative,746
747,"While ILO interventions such as Better Work and Better Factories could turn partner countries into ethical sourcing options for global buyers and consumers, and lead to improvements in the more visible or physical problems, there are a number of labour rights issues12 that remain unaddressed.",negative,747
748,"In addition, the Strategic Management Module does not allow the contributions made by the various ILO units to be measured in a systematic manner.",negative,748
749,Each strategy has a unique set of sub-issues that have far reaching implications.,negative,749
750,It is questionable to hold SECTOR accountable for the indicators contained in the P&B while the work to be done for sectoral activities is planned under a different and autonomous procedure over which it has little control.,negative,750
751,"There is in fact, little in the way of a cogent strategy to achieve Outcome 13, at least in the generally accepted sense of the word.",negative,751
752,"However, the difficulties of valuing its sectoral work, which is, by and large, normative in nature, may preclude the ILO from being able to demonstrate the comparative advantage of its sectoral work in the UN development system of the future.",negative,752
753,This incoherence may have led to inconsistencies and errors in reporting.,negative,753
754,"More work however, needs to be done.",negative,754
755,The evaluation team was therefore put in the invidious position of evaluating strate- gic performance with a lack of clarity about strategy and with poorly-defined performance indicators.,negative,755
756,"While skills development has clear synergies with other crosscutting work of the ILO, the P&B processes in place at the time the evaluation was carried out might have created a disincentive for collaboration.",negative,756
757,"Given the high demand and need, however, further guidance may be needed on organizational priorities, including geographical focus.",negative,757
758,"This lack of coherence and alignment could have led to inconsistencies and errors in reporting, as country offices might have been faced with the difficult choice of either adhering strictly to the Strategic Policy Framework or adjusting their reporting to fit better with the global results framework.",negative,758
759,"Nevertheless, a number of constraints to operational efficiency and effectiveness were identified through the survey, including issues related to access to technical expertise, time required for internal decision-making and funding, including adequate access to both financial and human resources.",negative,759
760,"This was observed by the evaluation team, which cited cases where the sustainable results for individuals were positive although the sustaina- bility of the intervention itself was not certain.",negative,760
761,"However, the field visits did not find much hard evidence of this.",negative,761
762,A number of significant constraints to operational efficiency and effectiveness were identified through the survey.,negative,762
763,An examination of expen- diture on skills by country raised some questions about relative return on investment.,negative,763
764,"However, no data were available on the actual number of countries assessed as having attained this goal.",negative,764
765,The fact that evaluation topics are set on a yearly basis has impeded both use and consultation.,negative,765
766,It is the only UN system organization to follow this pattern.,negative,766
767,"However, there is little effective connection between evaluation and results-based management within the Office.",negative,767
768,"There have been training initiatives, but the results have been uneven and there is an expressed need for additional training at all levels, including for stakeholders.",negative,768
769,"At the same time, the full potential of institutional learning from the evaluations has not yet been realized.",negative,769
770,"There is little connection between the high-level evaluations and results-based management represented by the Strategic Policy Framework, biennial programme budgets or programme implementation reports.",negative,770
771,"As with the accountability objective, the IEE finds that use of the evaluations for management purposes is uneven.",negative,771
772,"A second issue is the nature and unpredictability of exis- ting donor funding for social protection, which often results in rather small, short projects that are not conducive to supporting long-term processes of change.",negative,772
773,"Gender integration differs across country programmes, but generally lacks explicit focus and monitoring where there is no specialized gender support capacity.",negative,773
774,The available data did not allow a comprehensive assessment of the achievement of these goals.,negative,774
775,"However, country and global operations are to a large extent financed through technical cooperation resources.",negative,775
776,"To date, few ILO- supported country-level decent work strategies consider private sector enterprise development beyond the potential for enterprise-level job creation.",negative,776
777,"The review of the projects, however, shows that transitioning from a largely technical cooperation approach focusing heavily on training takes time and may not be as readily financed by donors.",negative,777
778,"Without this, ILO country offices tend to respond to shorter term and pragmatic approaches to enterprise development, which governments demand and donors fund, tending to overlook opportunities for longer term and more systematic change, in the hope of offering simple solutions to complex problems.",negative,778
779,"A more concentrated effort and more targeting through sectors, communities and vulnerable groups would add focus, increase visibility and, potentially, have a higher impact.",negative,779
780,"The dependency on two donors, however, poses uncomfortable risks for this promising area of work, which could flounder if funding were not sustained.",negative,780
781,"The work to promote enterprise associations and cooperative enterprises was found to have great potential but is currently underdeveloped, in large part due to limited funds and, as yet, too few cases of cooperative approaches being integrated into small enterprise development technical cooperation.",negative,781
782,There is also a need to reduce external and internal user barriers and to integrate content and messages to encompass the broader Decent Work Agenda.,negative,782
783,"However, the level of effort across the various indicators has been uneven, with more effort and resources focusing on entrepreneurship projects and programmes than on other pillars.",negative,783
784,There is currently no clear orientation and coordination within the Office on how the sustainable enterprise strategy could tap such resources in the longer term for small enterprise strategy development at the country level.,negative,784
785,This engagement needs to go beyond private sector partnerships and the Office is struggling to articulate an actionable strategy.,negative,785
786,"It is weak in terms of explicit development-oriented objectives, reducing its value added and relevance as a framework for the implementation of ILO TC during the period in question.",negative,786
787,The lowest level of coherence was found in countries that did not have formal ILO representation.,negative,787
788,In none of the cases reviewed were the DWCPs costed and anchored in budgets.,negative,788
789,"However, it is not clear whether the overheads charged by other agencies and NGOs are an accurate or realistic reflection of their administrative costs or whether they include the same elements in their calculations as the ILO when determining support costs.",negative,789
790,These were mostly associated with delays in recruitment or procurement.,negative,790
791,"This results in infrequent or insufficient field missions, particularly with regard to country portfolio and policy development, and results in missed opportunities.",negative,791
792,"Overall, DWCPs tend to be conceptual documents, consisting of broad sectoral analyses followed by pro- posed priorities with outcomes and indicators.",negative,792
793,There are substantial routine business inefficiencies associated with the practice of giving out-of-country managers onerous portfolios.,negative,793
794,"The evaluation, therefore, concludes that there are currently insufficient data to enable the impact of ILO TC to be evaluated.",negative,794
795,"The reliance on second phase funding was observed to face increasing challenges, since traditional donor fun- ding is declining in many countries.",negative,795
796,Coordination activities by YEP to support internal coherence and complementarity have been hindered by its limited empowerment and lack of dedicated human resources.,negative,796

798,"The degree of youth employment coordination among various ministries, government agencies and the social partners has been reported as generally low for many of the countries where the ILO is working on youth employment.",negative,798
799,"As some evaluation case studies indicate, more work has to be done to generate among ILO partners an integrated approach specifically focused on youth employment.",negative,799
800,"The approach adopted appears to be an application of the overall ILO initiative on employment generation rather than on an integrated vision and methodology specifically addressing youth, although the ILO itself has developed approaches that respond to the specific needs of young people such as the life-cycle approach and other policy tools.",negative,800

802,"The multi-faceted character of interventions requires multi-disciplinary approaches, and this is why youth employment initiatives are normally multi-departmental.",negative,802
803,There are a number of areas where coordination could be strengthened.,negative,803
804,"As already mentioned, current coordination between headquarters and the field mostly involves staff attached to the Employment Sector.",negative,804

1548,"On the other hand, in many operations resources are extremely limited, and the unmet basic rights and needs are enormous.",negative,1548
1549,"However, lessons learned from the use of the PA indicate that it is time for UNHCR to move beyond institutionalizing participatory ""assessment"" per se, towards an understanding of ""assessment"" as only the first stage in the programming cycle.",negative,1549
1550,"The evaluation team finds that the objectives set for this result of the AGDM ACTION Plan are somewhat contrary to the spirit and purpose of the AGDM Strategy as whole, and also raise fundamental questions about its coherence to date.",negative,1550
1551,It is difficult to align global standards of assistance with receptiveness to local diverse needs promoted by AGDM.,negative,1551
1552,"In many operations, staff described the challenge they face in defining appropriate priorities in line with the resource limitations.",negative,1552
1553,"An additional problem in several operations is that many donor-funded projects are highly restricted and funds cannot be used to address basic causes, rather than the symptoms, of some of the protection problems they are intended to address.",negative,1553
1554,"All evidence clearly shows that protection risks to women, children, older persons, persons with disabilities and other at-risk groups go up as access to basic needs and the means of survival (culturally appropriate foods, water, shelter, etc.) decreases.",negative,1554
1555,"Performance of FPCs was far more variable in determining strategic priorities and in developing work plans, which negatively impacted their ability to monitor their performance.",negative,1555
1556,"The evaluation found no explicit or consistent evidence of promotion of AAP by FPCs although protection actors, including UNHCR, had AAP mechanisms in place.",negative,1556
1557,"Where gaps have occurred, these have frequently been covered on an interim basis by UNHCR staff or by surge staff from standby rosters.",negative,1557
1558,Collaboration with local NGOs and civil society groups is an area that UNHCR could strengthen and there is the potential for it to play a leadership role among peer CLAs in setting an agenda for transforming its engagement.,negative,1558
1559,"While PoLR exists at the conceptual level, the complex cluster architecture has caused confusion about how to operationalise these important responsibilities.",negative,1559
1560,AAP is frequently considered to be a seventh function of cluster coordination; it has also regularly been highlighted as one of the weakest components of the implementation of the TA.,negative,1560
1561,UNHCR has made mixed progress in its collaboration with core cluster partners.,negative,1561
1562,"From the perspective of effectiveness, one area that has received insufficient attention by UNHCR is its oversight of cluster performance.",negative,1562
1563,Changes identified in the protection provided to PoCs appeared principally to reflect national contextual factors rather than being clearly driven by the strategies.,negative,1563
1564,"Further, there was lack of clarity about the precise status and purpose of the strategies and their relationship to other strategic guidance.",negative,1564
1565,"The strategies also do not sufficiently acknowledge the different types of needs faced by persons of concern, and the implications of this for how strategies could be implemented.",negative,1565
1566,Guidance notes and tools provided limited guidance or support to country operations about how to generate data on indicators.,negative,1566
1567,It is therefore difficult to ascertain the degree of influence of the Education Strategy on programming developed after its rollout.,negative,1567
1568,This reflects the fact that reporting does not take place against a consistent set of indicators directly related to strategy objectives either across countries or over time.,negative,1568
1569,It was clear from interviews and reviews of other information that major unresolved protection issues in the areas covered by the three strategies remained for PoCs in the five case study countries.,negative,1569
1570,It is however difficult to identify results and changes that can be clearly attributed at the country level to the strategies.,negative,1570

1573,UNHCR Country Offices may lack the skills and resources to fully adapt and implement the strategies.,negative,1573
1574,"The COP process based around a single year budget with considerable uncertainty about, and fluctuations in, resource availability militates against coherent strategy planning and implementation.",negative,1574
1575,The strategies (and the supporting documentation and processes) may be seen as insufficiently prescriptive while also not providing sufficiently structured guidance on how to deal with the sorts of challenges that Country Offices in fact encounter.,negative,1575
1576,The comparison of the COPs for 2012 and 2016 for the five case study countries did not allow a conclusive assessment of progress because of a lack of consistency in the indicators reported.,negative,1576
1577,There are many areas in which international standards have not been met and the fragility of the settlements and the risks posed to refugees living there remain a concern.,negative,1577
1578,"Without formal authority, however, the accountability for the response has been and remains ambiguous.",negative,1578
1579,"Despite practical guidance, the data on the response indicates that protection issues have not always been prioritized by all the agencies in their delivery.",negative,1579
1580,"Nevertheless, a conducive and protective environment is far from established for the refugee population and could quite easily deteriorate given many negative external factors.",negative,1580
1581,"At the camp level, there is an inherent tension resultant from the different systems, processes and approaches used by UNHCR and IOM with geographic responsibilities in terms of coverage and delivery.",negative,1581
1582,"Fundamentally, there is no clear accountability within the response, with no single entity in charge.",negative,1582

1584,"Thus far, there has been little movement on some form of limited right to work, education, access to justice and freedom of movement.",negative,1584
1585,The evaluation concludes that much work needs to be done with government and civil society partners in Bangladesh to develop greater understanding and build consensus.,negative,1585
1586,The anomalous coordination and leadership arrangements have not helped the response; at times there has also been fierce and unhelpful competition between IOM and UNHCR.,negative,1586
1587,"This has created confusion, efficiency losses, and tensions.",negative,1587
1588,"This evaluation demonstrates that there are consequences for people if the established UN architecture is not used, and also damage to the credibility of the UN and the humanitarian community.",negative,1588
1589,"In the absence of law enforcement authorities in significant numbers, there is a perception of insecurity in the camps at night, and the lack of legal employment has reportedly forced some refugees into illegal exploitative laboursituations, or worse options such as drug trafficking and commercial sex work.",negative,1589
1590,This may require UNHCR to foster a role that goes beyond what it has envisioned from its accumulated experience.,negative,1590
1591,The complicated and ad hoc coordination and leadership arrangements have made decision making slower and more difficult.,negative,1591
1592,Where UNHCR has been much less effective is in navigating the politics of return.,negative,1592

1594,"There have also been challenges in providing accommodation to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) refugees.",negative,1594
1595,"Although alternative resettlement countries have been found for most of the rejected cases, this created an extra burden for UNHCR as well as delays for the concerned refugees.",negative,1595
1596,"Thus, in Timisoara, three UNHCR staff (with UNHCR or UNOPS contracts) work in the centre.",negative,1596
1597,"This can be partially attributed to outdated guidance notes and a gap between vision and practice, which has led to different views on the usage of these centres.",negative,1597
1598,This limitation is extremely frustrating for refugees and leads to a degree of institutionalization.,negative,1598
1599,This has produced a living environment in which stress and tensions between individuals can more easily build up.,negative,1599
1600,The underutilization of the ETCs was regularly raised as a concern by interlocutors.,negative,1600

2681,"Overall, a positive impact has been noted as the operational framework for DRR and DRM has been established following the tested SOPs, with the tabletop exercises now co-owned by the Federated States of Micronesia project partners, being included in the Government budget.",positive,2681
2682,The unplanned positive effects from the distribution of menstrual hygiene kits and the Cookhouse consultations in the Republic of the Marshall Islands are seen through open discussions on topics previously considered as taboo and the change of attitude as both Governments became generally more interested and aware of the importance of the gender perspective in response to disasters (a gender perspective now is included in the development of disaster response plans or contingency plans).,positive,2682
2683,"There are visible instances of increased local ownership, such as policies set aside under 2019 budget preparation to include larger allocations for DRM or national contributions increasingly provided to the organization of annual outer islands focal point workshops and tabletop exercises.",positive,2683

2857,"Many of the EMSP projects approved in 2010 are coming to an end in 2014 and will be required to undergo some form of terminal evaluation in line with UNEP policy, so the number of evaluations of EMSP is expected to rise considerably during the MTS 2014-2017.",positive,2857
2858,"This would improve delivery of the ecosystem management approach, but there was some concern over how to develop common goals and messaging and to manage relationships with donors, when smaller projects are strung together (potential conflicts due to separate accountability to donors and the PoW being an issue for instance).",positive,2858

2871,"On the face of that, Environmental Sustainability can be rated Moderately Likely (ML).",positive,2871
2872,The Project has represented the starting point of a growing process of capacity and institution building and has unquestionably played a catalytic role.,positive,2872

2881,The project was effective in terms of outputs: all were achieved and several of them beyond the targeted level.,positive,2881
2882,"The flexibility of UN Environment management and the willingness of donors to jointly plan activities of different sub-projects in the same country and even fully merge funds for activities, helped to have more financial and human capacity available and achieve a larger than originally planned amount of products, as well as to adjust project activities to country demand.",positive,2882
2883,"The project effectively achieved its outcomes, as defined in the project documentation7.",positive,2883
2884,"Overall, the Project achieved a change in the attitude of countries, rather than in action: although there are few concrete examples of GE in practice, country ownership and UN Environment support resulted in the development and, in some countries, acceptance at a policy level such as GE action plans, implementation plans, or inclusion of GE in development policies.",positive,2884
2885,The GE project was efficiently managed by well-qualified staff and supervised adequately by the highest management levels in UN Environment; this has ensured global academic leadership of UN Environment in the theme of Green Economy and well-received advisory services to countries.,positive,2885

2927,"Overall, the QIP effectively carried out its activities and moved towards meeting its objectives.",positive,2927
2928,"To its credit, the UNHCR office in Malaysia has found creative ways of augmenting its capacity, not only by engaging with refugee community organizations but also by establishing an innovative volunteer programme, by making effective use of legal interns, by building up an auxiliary workforce consisting of people who are not employed on UNHCR contracts, and by recruiting some particularly well-qualified and highly motivated national staff.",positive,2928
2929,Training facilitated by the protection cluster and advocacy within the HCT resulted in a heightened awareness of protection principles among humanitarian actors.,positive,2929
2930,The consensus amongst peer UN agencies and International Non-governmental Organisations (INGO) was that UNHCR had added value but not optimised their comparative advantage.,positive,2930

2948,"Despite it being located outside of the clusters, multi-sector has attracted considerable funding and CERF has offered the opportunity for UNHCR to advocate to the wider humanitarian community about refugee needs and to involve them in decision-making when inclusive approaches have been adopted for CERF prioritisation.",positive,2948
2949,"While there is still scope for strengthening the reliability of the data, analysis from the CERF secretariat suggests that UNHCR performs extremely well in the timeliness of its sub-granting although its own pre-financing tools are often supplemented by the willingness of its partners to pre-finance their own activities.",positive,2949
2950,"While the review did not seek to assess the results of CERF funding on beneficiary populations and hence cannot make any judgments on programme effectiveness, the data held by the CERF secretariat on procedural compliance suggest that UNHCR has been a responsible steward of CERF funding which it uses in a timely way and that it has systems in place to spend to budget and within project timeframes.",positive,2950
2951,There is currently a strong cadre of CERF-aware staff in the organisation and there is little evidence of missed opportunities for participating in CERF processes.,positive,2951
2952,"At the same time, however, transition of RSD responsibility to national authorities highlights the vital importance of, as well as the many challenges associated with, mobilising the capacity and willingness of the state to offer protection in line with international obligations.",positive,2952
2953,"These include the value of careful planning, and setting and adhering to realistic timeframes; the need to commit and ensure deliver of sufficient resources, on the part of UNHCR and national authorities; the importance of a strong national legal framework, reflecting international refugee and human rights law; and ensuring that all of the processes and institutions envisaged thereunder are established and become operative in a timely way.",positive,2953

3507,FAO has a number of unique strengths with which to address CCAM.,neutral,3507
3508,The findings on the most salient strengths and weaknesses are summarized below.,neutral,3508
3509,Finding 2: It is through engaging with Government at country level that FAO can bring the greatest contributions on CCAM.,neutral,3509
3510,"Many other development organizations, including those with far greater resources than FAO, have engaged directly with governments in country on climate change and the agricultural sectors much more so than FAO has, and member countries continue to develop their own capacities in these fields.",neutral,3510
3511,"In the UNFCCC, FAO has brought greater attention to the role of the agricultural sectors in CCAM through the knowledge it has provided at the sessions.",neutral,3511
3512,"The analytical support, tools and data provided to member countries by FAO have been of substantial quality and have strengthened national knowledge and data systems for CCAM.",neutral,3512
3513,"While developing policies for CCAM should remain an important goal for FAO, its highest valued added lies in aligning and harmonizing the climate change and DRR strategies, policies and systems of government agencies and other partners.",neutral,3513
3514,"Given their importance for producers and consumers, vulnerability to climate change and sizeable contributions to GHG emissions, there is significant scope for FAO to increase its focus on value chains and food systems rather than merely food production, if it wishes to be more effective in pursuing adaptation, mitigation, and food security.",neutral,3514
3515,"Finding 9: FAO has adopted relatively few programmatic, multi-sectoral, landscape and transboundary approaches, which are essential for meeting the current and future challenges posed by climate change to the agriculture, forestry and fishery sectors.",neutral,3515
3516,"A key challenge in this regard has been the lack of conceptual clarity and guidance on the differences among emergency, DRR and long-term adaptation interventions.",neutral,3516
3517,The agency will need to achieve a greater understanding and consensus on climate change adaptation if it is to be more effective in supporting it.,neutral,3517
3518,"Partnerships for CCAM Finding 12: FAO pursued relatively few strategic partnerships with NGOs, other knowledge organizations and the private sector for CCAM to, respectively, disseminate best practices, draw on advanced expertise and data, and influence global food systems.",neutral,3518
3519,Such collaboration would be useful in helping FAO beneficiaries overcome the barriers to adopting climate adaptation practices.,neutral,3519
3520,Mainstreaming climate change will also help to incorporate basic design and implementation best practices into projects and programmes.,neutral,3520
3521,Agency-wide coordination to develop a strategy and facilitate cross-sector collaboration has emerged yet requires strengthening.,neutral,3521
3522,"However, CCAM can require additional measures.",neutral,3522

3545,"This could include, for example, more timely products, translation of key summaries into Somali, and improved programming guidelines for the Food Security Outlooks.",neutral,3545
3546,"Based on the information collected from stakeholders, the evaluation team feels that it is not realistic for the Somali government to take over the data analysis and database management, due to limited technical and institutional capacity.",neutral,3546
3547,"It is critical to continue strengthening the capacity development measures in the upcoming phase, in order to create Somali ownership of the process.",neutral,3547

3715,"In practice, at any given time, most technical work has been on one aspect or another of social protection, not on broad integrative approaches.",neutral,3715
3716,"Cases studies also provided concrete examples (e.g., Ghana and Nepal) of where the ILO was providing both traditional, actuarial advice as well as advising on extending social protection through universal approaches.",neutral,3716
3717,"As interest grows in the social protection floor, and integrated approaches to generate employment while extending social protection, the pressure to mobilise resources will also intensify.",neutral,3717
3718,"At field level, demand for operational approaches combining employment with social protection is growing very rapidly.",neutral,3718
3719,"Universalism, a rights-based approach, and pluralism are now squarely on the table, replacing the idea that the best way to extend social protection is to eliminate informality while expanding existing institutions.",neutral,3719
3720,"However, as indicated by growing interest in integrating employment and social protection policies, and in view of the rising number of countries that are designing broad national social protection policies, the chances are improving.",neutral,3720
3721,Perhaps the greatest high-level strategic challenge is that the ILO must counterbalance its commitment to poverty reduction in low-income countries with the higher probability of sustainability in middle-income countries.,neutral,3721
3722,See figure 2 for overall evaluation ratings associated with key performance questions posed by the evaluation.,neutral,3722

3738,The achievement of sustainability particularly in low-income countries requires an enormous amount of long-term support.,neutral,3738
3739,This chapter presents some of the specific findings of the evaluation.,neutral,3739
3740,Relevance The evaluation team took a nuanced approach to relevance.,neutral,3740
3741,The current system consists of one set of workplans developed under an Office-wide procedure for the preparation of the Programme and Budget while the work to be done for the SAP is planned under a different and autonomous procedure.,neutral,3741
3742,"Respondents from both groups were asked to rate the extent to which activities, outputs and follow-up met their needs.",neutral,3742
3743,"ILO leaders have, on many occasions, stated their commitment to results-based management (RBM).",neutral,3743
3744,"It raises the value and output of labour, empowers workers and enriches their lives and improves the productivity, sustainability and compet- itiveness of enterprises.",neutral,3744
3745,"For example, work in national training system reform is hard to compare with projects that build skills to improve livelihoods in rural communities.",neutral,3745
3746,Performance was examined through the lens of the Strategic Policy Framework.,neutral,3746
3747,FINDINGS A. Relevance,neutral,3747
3748,"The question is how the ILO can simultaneously deliver on the broadened social protection floor agenda and growing demand for country support, and enhance or maintain specialized in-house expertise, while also delivering on the expanding global agenda.",neutral,3748
3749,Summary of findings A. Relevance and coherence,neutral,3749
3750,Meaningful engagement with the private sector as investors and donors will be increasingly relevant for decent work outcomes.,neutral,3750

3753,Figure 1 converts these figures into an average performance score by criterion.,neutral,3753
3754,"It draws on interdepartmental and inter-sectoral initiatives, field and headquarters collaboration, the involvement of constituents, and the development of external partnerships.",neutral,3754
3755,"The Programme coordinates research, promotional activities and the provision of policy advice and technical assistance to support ILO constituents in their endeavours to improve the quantity and quality of jobs for young people.",neutral,3755
3756,The main findings related to the above criteria are described below.,neutral,3756
3757,"The intertwining of youth development policies, employment and other social policies is a priority when addressing youth employment at national level.",neutral,3757
3758,Inter-agency UN approaches and joint implementation will most likely become the predominant modality to implement initiatives that respond to the cross-cutting nature of the youth employment challenge.,neutral,3758
3759,"ILO calls for mutually reinforcing action to promote gender equality in staffing, substance and structure in the policy.",neutral,3759
3760,"In this regard, evaluation is really important to demonstrate results.",neutral,3760
3761,An Action Plan is necessary as it reminds and convinces ILO staff that gender equality is an inherent value of ILO and should remain high up on all agendas.,neutral,3761
3762,"ILO probably requires an updated vision on gender equality, outlining where the ILO is going with gender equality and what is expected and why.",neutral,3762
3763,Some suggestions are included in the evaluation report (Box 5).,neutral,3763
3764,The next Action Plan should be deeply ingrained in and linked to the ten P&B outcomes.,neutral,3764
3765,"The Organization could play a much more important role in the humanitarian response, given its specificity and uniqueness in compa- rison with other UN agencies.",neutral,3765
3766,"These interventions target key actors at every level, ranging from high-level decision-makers at national and international levels (i.e. legislators, policy-makers, national tripartite structures) to key labour market intermediaries (i.e. trade unions, employers’ organizations, labour inspectorates) to beneficiaries and target groups at local level (i.e. workers, employers, training organizations).",neutral,3766
3767,This distinction is addressed in the report.,neutral,3767

3773,Fragmentation of effort in youth employment development needs to be minimized.,neutral,3773
3774,"The ILO itself needs to be careful not to reinforce piecemeal approaches, mainly by focusing on the use of single tools instead of promoting holistic solutions.",neutral,3774

3784,The designs of SF interventions differ with the scope.,neutral,3784
3785,The inclusion of social finance into DWCP designs naturally differs according to the national contexts.,neutral,3785
3786,"The effectiveness of social finance interventions should be seen as the extent to which they together contribute to the achievement of the 2005 GB mandate: more employment, less vulnerability, and stronger constituents.",neutral,3786
3787,"The duration of a partnership, and the initial capacity of the partner organisation are the most important factors in long-term capacity development.",neutral,3787
3788,They are often better placed to generate capacity than the ILO itself as the implementer of training.,neutral,3788
3789,"The momentum resulting from the financial and microfinance crises points to two complementary approaches, one upstream and one downstream.",neutral,3789
3790,"Notably, this insight is limited to the area of technical cooperation and has a time lag of several years.",neutral,3790
3791,The introduction of a country programme approach is of relatively recent origin.,neutral,3791
3792,"For most countries, the adjustment process initially involved reformulating a set of individual interventions, often funded individually by different donors, into a more focused programme based on agreed Decent Work outcomes.",neutral,3792
3793,"At the time the DWCP evaluations took place, this transition process was still underway.",neutral,3793
3794,It is also required at the public sector level amongst those agencies whose mandate is to oversee Decent Work issues.,neutral,3794
3795,Such findings have some general implications for future programming.,neutral,3795
3796,The long-term goal was to embed the donor-specific process into the national process in order to enhance mutual accountability and domestic accountability.,neutral,3796
3797,Major disruptions occurred in the economies of countries evaluated during the 2001-2010 decade in which the nine DWCPs were evaluated.,neutral,3797

3806,"Attribution is difficult to measure, and in many cases, incremental changes can only be noted in the policy sphere.",neutral,3806
3807,"Most interviewees made the point that with more human resources and better coordination with national strategies from the start, pilot initiatives would have made better progress and be more sustainable.",neutral,3807
3808,The need for a focus on MDWs themselves has been fully recognised as the most sustainable approach for collective action to build advocacy approaches.,neutral,3808

3812,"The initial project design was ambitious, with 56 surveys in 28 countries to be implemented, analysed, and disseminated within the five-year period (later modified to 53 surveys in 34 countries).",neutral,3812
3813,"In contrast, strategic investment would have the potential to increase the value (impact) of the resources already produced through the W4Y project.",neutral,3813
3814,"When assessing impact at the country level, it cannot be overemphasized that the evaluation team is drawing on the experiences of six (out of 34) countries.",neutral,3814
3815,"Criteria for identifying the countries where the potential for impact would be greater would include: how recent was the latest survey completed, the existence of a relevant policy process to support and analytical capacity (or opportunity to develop capacity) of key stakeholders.",neutral,3815
3816,"The extent to which this is possible is, however, influenced by the limited amount of financial and other resources allocated by the different stakeholders.",neutral,3816
3817,"The ILO work on migration, child labour and the informal economy has already integrated issues on non-discrimination, support for orphans and economic empowerment, for example.",neutral,3817
3818,The ILO interaction with UNAIDs at global level has primarily been linked to high-level programmatic coordination with ILO status and requirements as a co-sponsor.,neutral,3818
3819,A major challenge has been to consolidate and effectively monitor and report to UNAIDS on the ILO‘s full range of HIV cross-cutting work and resources.,neutral,3819
3820,"The ten UNAIDS co-sponsoring organizations have different sizes, levels of country presence, mandates and modes of operations.",neutral,3820

3835,"Multiple initiatives3 aimed at measuring progress in terms of DW in the countries call for better coherence within and among countries, with more attention being given to training, and building local analytical and institutional capacity.",neutral,3835
3836,"This has contributed to the fact that many international organizations mainstream DW concepts into their work, for example, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)5 , United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 6 and the EC.",neutral,3836
3837,"However, more integrated local UN programmes are required to sustain mainstreaming, as seen in the case of Delivering as One (DAO) countries.",neutral,3837

3852,Further dialogue within S. E Europe is likely to benefit from further linkages with ASEM.,neutral,3852
3853,This is in part explained by the fact that the implementation of the MCOF at these levels does not always imply additional allocation of resources.,neutral,3853

3984,"At the country level, UNEP also strongly relies on partnerships with other UN agencies, government institutions and civil society since UNEP lacks the resources to conduct large scale capacity building programmes by itself.",neutral,3984
3985,Monitoring should also keep track of progress on immediate outcomes.,neutral,3985
3986,"In addition, UNEP was to focus its activities on a limited number of countries requesting its support (emphasis on least developed countries and small island developing states) to achieve more tangible results and greater impact, rather than spreading effort too thinly, particularly where there was clear potential for results and transfer of knowledge or to build synergies with other UNEP subprogrammes, UN agencies and other partners, or where opportunities existed to build on past work.",neutral,3986

3994,"GEF projects, whilst responding to GEF priorities could build on UNEP work and assist in scaling up and replication of initiatives developed with non-GEF resources.",neutral,3994
3995,UNEP staff dealing with GEF projects should be engaged in EMSP strategic thinking that should preceed and complement more formal PoW and work planning processes.,neutral,3995
3996,"On the other hand, projects should factor in adequate project scoping and inception phases to allow adaptations based on consultations with partners.",neutral,3996

4002,There is an increasing (and almost overwhelming) demand for UNEP support on EMSP issues at country level but ROs currently have had very limited financial and human resources to meet this demand and staff are frequently over-stretched.,neutral,4002
4003,"A wide cross-section of interviewees indicated that earlier and more comprehensive involvement of ROs and linkage to UNEP regional assessments would result in design of a PoW that better responds to the needs of countries, and that joint planning and implementation arrangements need to be put in place.",neutral,4003

4074,Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations 23.,neutral,4074
4075,The formulation of a responsible transition strategy with policies and additional tools should enable UNHCR to strengthen its support and help States to meet the challenges involved in individual RSD.,neutral,4075
4076,Political willingness is on the other hand not a safeguard for correct RSD decision-making in compliance with international norms.,neutral,4076
4077,The review recommends (1) the identification of a limited set of global indicators for continued mandate RSD to capture these situations.,neutral,4077
4078,"These foundations require a much longer perspective and should fit in agendas for development, good governance and the rule of law.",neutral,4078
4079,Especially in the area of independent appeals and legal assistance international standards and practice have evolved.,neutral,4079
4080,"Much will depend on the wishes of the government, possible protection gaps, the risk of national structures becoming overwhelmed from the start, and standards of fairness.",neutral,4080
4081,It should include the development of model SOPs for such mandate RSD procedures.,neutral,4081
4082,"Although funding may provide general leverage, its use as a tool for encouraging concrete improvements in RSD appears to be difficult and limited.",neutral,4082
4083,"Adequate resources are not only necessary to support authorities when they start the new procedure but throughout the transition process, from assessment and planning to transfer, implementation and consolidation.",neutral,4083
4084,Resource inputs are also necessary to work on the foundations for a sustainable protection environment at same time.,neutral,4084
4085,The report recommends (11) that UNHCR considers establishing benchmarks for protection staffing in situations of transition.,neutral,4085
4086,"The answers to the questionnaire and additional research have resulted in a historical graph, which is contained in annex III to the report.",neutral,4086
4087,"Ultimately, the political willingness to invest in an adequate system and the humanitarian spirit with which it is operated will be decisive for the proper identification of refugees.",neutral,4087
4088,"In addition, it is proposed (vi) to complement the findings with a more strategic inquiry into recent alternative, protection sensitive strategies which have helped to relieve pressures on individual RSD systems.",neutral,4088
4089,There is a lack of evidence to show that CERF has been successful in leveraging additional income for UNHCR and there was some suggestion that the opposite may be true.,neutral,4089
4090,"Somalis comprised the largest nationality group among asylum-seekers and refugees, at some 427,311.",neutral,4090
4091,"The number of pending claims in Kakuma remains substantial, and will require concerted efforts to address it and ensure that decision-making can continue to keep pace with new claims.",neutral,4091

4290,The response to the sudden influx of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya into Bangladesh in August 2017 has been complex and challenging.,neutral,4290
4291,"The next phase will be equally challenging, albeit in a different way.",neutral,4291
4292,This outcome was not guaranteed.,neutral,4292
4293,A Prime Ministerial directive in mid-September enabled UNHCR to work at scale throughout the affected region.,neutral,4293
4294,"In practice, this translates to undertaking activities aimed at obtaining full respect for the rights of individuals, in accordance with international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law.",neutral,4294
4295,"As a result, it should be examined together with the findings in the next section.",neutral,4295

4297,"Unfortunately, its launch coincided with the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between UNHCR, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of Myanmar, the contents of which have not been made public, leading to suspicion among the Rohingya refugees as to the true purpose for the registration, and concurrently, a slow uptake.",neutral,4297
4298,"In the settlements, community-based protection approaches were a critical intervention given that the scale of the response made it close to impossible to establish and manage an effective case management system, particularly in the first few months.",neutral,4298
4299,"Many of the agencies in the refugee response do not have refugee protection expertise or backgrounds in protection, and mainstreaming protection seems rather abstract.",neutral,4299
4300,"Already some refugees reportedly resort to hazardous and exploitative illegal work to get by, including within the drugs trade and the sex industry.",neutral,4300

4323,"Considering the nature of emergency case handling, and the flexibility this requires, the ETCs must always have space available to receive cases with serious protection needs.",neutral,4323

4370,"The activities related to the strengthening of the Bocaina Mosaic, including the establishment of a permanent executive structure, were largely based on a misconception at the time the project was conceived.",negative,4370
4371,"This was the failure to recognize the essence of the Mosaic concept, which is consultative, rather than executive.",negative,4371
4372,"Eventually due to the nature of the Mosaic, the many stakeholders involved, political interests and other issues, more conflicts arose and by 2016 the Bocaina Mosaic activities came to a standstill.",negative,4372

4376,"As a result, the municipalities set priorities within the scope of sanitation, but which did not contribute to the achievement of project objectives.",negative,4376
4377,"However, at project conception it was wrongly considered that the mosaic was to have an executive character, where in reality it is merely consultative.",negative,4377

4379,Conclusion 2.,negative,4379
4380,"The project was not able to deliver significantly on its outputs related to the Bocaina Mosaic, which had serious consequences for achieving improved integrated management of ecosystems of global importance in the Bocaina Mosaic.",negative,4380
4381,Conclusion 5.,negative,4381
4382,The project failed to deliver on the reduction of the BOD values.,negative,4382
4383,The FTPP was designed without a robust results framework or Theory of Change (ToC).,negative,4383
4384,"The ET reconstructed the intended ToC (Figure 2) which shows that the robustness and realism of the intended objectives depended on stakeholders that were not included, namely actors that can reach beneficiaries at the field level, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations (CBOs).",negative,4384
4385,"With very few exceptions, the implementation has not included partners that can facilitate results in the field.",negative,4385
4386,"Moreover, the operational and financial framework lacks effective management and follow-up systems for the projects, and is not well understood by partners, especially regarding the division of roles and responsibilities.",negative,4386
4387,"Despite the gender issues inherent in most projects, for example, no gender analysis was conducted.",negative,4387
4388,"The discussions with stakeholders at all levels revealed a significant gap in capacities, attitudes and knowledge regarding gender equality, as well as how this issue could be addressed.",negative,4388
4389,"The draft policies and strategic plans were either not approved, or the approval was still in process.",negative,4389
4390,The evaluation attributed this issue to a lack of ownership of the documents.,negative,4390
4391,"However, the programme started without either a real design or results-based framework.",negative,4391
4392,"As a consequence of the missing programme framework, the projects lacked coherence and the outputs and outcomes did not lead to the goals initially envisaged for the programme.",negative,4392
4393,"Most of the scattered and small projects were unable to achieve impact in isolation, as the challenges they addressed were often interdependent.",negative,4393
4394,"Moreover, these projects did not collaborate with larger programmes on related issues.",negative,4394
4395,"As a result, some of the achievements (e.g. strategic plans and policies developed) were isolated and disconnected from the programme as a whole.",negative,4395
4396,"This was especially the case for field-oriented programmes, such as cattle production, watershed management and home-based nurseries, where the activities were developed around community organizations.",negative,4396
4397,"Moreover, it was noted that the selection and training process for workshops must ensure that participants will utilise the knowledge provided, and that the target group is well defined to suit the content.",negative,4397
4398,The programme aimed to be demand driven.,negative,4398
4399,"During the first phase, however, the evaluation found low levels of ownership at all levels in the recipient countries.",negative,4399
4400,This will require greater attention to the scale and impact of investment operations than merely stepping up resource mobilization for programme delivery.,negative,4400
4401,"With the private sector playing a significant role in financing the 2030 development agenda, FAO will also need to step up its private-sector engagement.",negative,4401
4402,The main shortcoming affecting the relevance of the projects evaluated was the decision to fund a large number of projects through two different funding windows at the same time.,negative,4402
4403,"This contributed to atomized funding, increased the risk of overlaps and affected the possibility of building mutually reinforcing synergies.",negative,4403
4404,"Furthermore, the vast majority of immediate action projects did not monitor the adaptability and productivity performance of PGRFA.",negative,4404
4405,"This represents a major shortcoming of the immediate action projects considering the high productivity rates of local varieties of beans, maize, millet, potato and sorghum, which could have been of great interest to other immediate action projects (especially in the same regions), and decision makers in building awareness at national level on the importance of PGRFA for sustainable livelihoods and climate change adaptation.",negative,4405
4406,"As a result, the strategic action plans in most cases could not be fully implemented.",negative,4406
4407,"However, the evaluation did identify cases where funded projects are helping to forge new alliances between farmers, NGOs and breeders in the interests of reducing dependency on traditional actors in PGRFA (namely public institutions that have diminishing resources).",negative,4407
4408,Immediate action projects have experienced difficulties in securing adequate funds since project closure.,negative,4408
4409,This has resulted in a large number of farmers discontinuing the use of PGRFA distributed.,negative,4409
4410,"However, taking into consideration the significant budget cuts in the country since 2016, it is probable that the level of replicability will be low in the next few years due to its high cost.",negative,4410
4411,"Regarding the replicability of economic activities, the evaluation was not able to determine their level of profitability at this time as they are still being performed.",negative,4411
4412,"In the majority of cases observed (handicrafts, dyeing of wool, etc.), the indications are that the beneficiaries still require training on topics such as quality control and the sale and marketing of their products and services",negative,4412
4413,"In particular, the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources was mainly focused on the harvesting of water resources in the upper paramo basins and sub-basins and the optimization of their use, the application of a pilot model of compensation mechanisms for the Payment for Environmental Services (PSA).",negative,4413
4414,"In contrast, the conservation of biodiversity and agrobiodiversity in the paramos was much less evident, partly because there was not enough awareness and recognition of their use and function.",negative,4414
4415,"Consequently, for example, it was observed that adaptation to climate change using local resistant crops in order to consolidate the food sovereignty and security of the communities involved in accordance with project objectives and the current legal framework (particularly the Law on Agrobiodiversity and Seeds) was not promoted.",negative,4415
4416,FAO therefore needs to more loudly share lessons from pilot projects and from its experience and expertise.,negative,4416
4417,"This requires a centralized monitoring and evaluation function, better knowledge management and outreach to make sure the lessons learned from TCPs and pilots are integrated into larger donor-funded projects, even if they will not be implemented by FAO.",negative,4417
4418,The Technical Working Group for Agriculture and Water (for which FAO is the lead development partner facilitator) could perhaps be utilized more for this purpose.,negative,4418
4419,It also limited the planned adaptive learning from resilience to climatic change.,negative,4419
4420,Some farmers who were skilled in poultry breeding management were not given birds to breed as anticipated.,negative,4420
4421,"However, the evaluation noted that other mangrove consultation frameworks already existed (for instance the Cameroon Mangrove Network) and the project could have focused on strengthening these networks.",negative,4421
4422,Issues about sustainability arose because these platforms do not have the financial resources to operate.,negative,4422
4423,"Furthermore, the project did not provide for actions to monitor the implementation of their action plans.",negative,4423
4424,"However, the studies carried out by the project did not always highlight gender specificities.",negative,4424
4425,"Finally, at community level, women have been involved to a limited extent, particularly in communal forest inventories and in the executive office of the Manoka Community Forest legal entity.",negative,4425
4426,"However, the design was not well balanced to ensure the adoption of a multisectoral approach in all JRP villages and throughout the duration of the project: the WASH component covered a limited number of villages in a single locality.",negative,4426
4427,A dramatic increase in the number of villages to correct an initial wrong estimate of the population catchment led to a postponement of food security and livelihood activities in about half the targeted villages.,negative,4427
4428,This reduced the integrated dimension of JRP and compromised the quality of some interventions.,negative,4428
4429,"Moreover, some Output 4 and 5 activities were monitored as a package through aggregated indicators that could not provide quantifiable evidence of what exactly was implemented.",negative,4429
4430,Results and effects of activities that just started at the end of 2016 could not be measured through the last follow-up survey in 2016.,negative,4430
4431,These are weak points of the M&E system that constrained the assessment of the scope and effects of the intervention.,negative,4431
4432,The revision of the CAP by technical experts reduced potential ownership and buy-in of the process by the communities.,negative,4432
4433,"However, targets had been discussed at the initial stage, so the CAP created expectations which could in turn generate frustration if targets were laterconsidered not to have been achieved by communities.",negative,4433
4434,This provides lessons on the involvement of communities in the design of future community-based resilience intervention (see Recommendation 3).,negative,4434
4435,"While this could have been an opportunity to strengthen the capacities of ministries to work together and develop multisectoral strategies, JRP did not make the most of it.",negative,4435
4436,"As far as possible, multisectoral programme should address the issue of national institutional mechanisms to implement a multisectoral approach.",negative,4436
4437,"WASH components raised an issue of sustainability, considering there was no effective water management committee, no fees were systematically collected for most water sources and locality services were weak.",negative,4437
4438,"A clear strategy to ensure some sustainability, relying on investment of the communities and included in the CAP should have been defined at design stage.",negative,4438
4439,"Moreover, adequate human resources should be allocated to mobilize communities which are not inclined to pay for water.",negative,4439
4440,"The choice of villages should have been documented in detail to clarify the various criteria used to select villages, the decision-making process and the roles of different actors involved.",negative,4440
4441,There was also a lack of clarity regarding the way project resources were shared between the 75 villages.,negative,4441
4442,"The selection of beneficiaries was left to the to the VDCs who have their own perception of equity, in practice often centred exclusively on balancing support to different tribal components of the community.",negative,4442
4443,"Though this may be a rational choice, it does not reflect the initial JRP criteria.",negative,4443
4444,"An obvious concentration of benefits towards certain individuals who did not necessarily belong to the most vulnerable segments of the population appeared as a risk, besides countering the stated JRP goal of reducing vulnerability.",negative,4444
4445,"Effectiveness at global level suffers from the lack of agreed managerial processes in the Management Committee (MC), limited resources, lack of staff, a lack of implementation of strategic planning and limited review of progress and activities being undertaken.",negative,4445
4446,The MC and the GSC are critical for the functioning of GF-TADs at global and regional level.,negative,4446
4447,"This is reflected in the commitment of its resources (human, financial and organizational) that is ill-defined and too limited to assure achievement of the agreed objectives.",negative,4447
4448,"There are needs for coordination, communication and joint learning expressed by the regions that currently cannot be met.",negative,4448
4449,"Even though farmers who benefitted from the FAO projects were ready to sell their excess produce to earn cash income, this was only possible in the locations where there was a market near the farm.",negative,4449
4450,"In addition to transportation costs, timeliness and quantity of delivery of the produce represented some of the challenges experienced by farmers.",negative,4450
4451,Multi-phased programme is needed in the areas requiring a long-term holistic capacity development while Training of Trainers helped utilize small training budgets effectively.,negative,4451
4452,Plans to hand over the field-tested prototype technology to the private sector for commercial distribution was underway as an exit strategy.,negative,4452
4453,A confounding finding (from analysis of CASU monitoring data) is that the amount of land put under legumes with conventional practices increased during the project period.,negative,4453
4454,"Hence, while the overall proportion of land used for CA cultivation of maize increased, the CA production of legumes decreased in comparison to the land farmed using conventional farming (CF) for legume production.2",negative,4454
4455,The late start-up of the activity meant that there was insufficient time to remedy these problems.,negative,4455
4456,This reflects the difficulties encountered throughout the region in identifying practical and sustainable mechanization solutions and finance solutions for small-scale farmers.,negative,4456
4457,The monitoring data has indicated that there has been considerable variation of application of CA techniques year to year and between crops.,negative,4457
4458,"Therefore, it is not possible to assume that scaling-up will continue for all crops.",negative,4458
4459,"With regard to achieving the outcomes of the third specific objective - to educate and raise awareness among decision-makers, teachers, students and consumers about the environmental, nutritional, cultural and economic value of agrobiodiversity - the project was less successful.",negative,4459
4460,"In particular, it did not manage to develop the exchange of information, lessons learned or good practices among its farmers and its intra and inter provincial organisations.",negative,4460
4461,"Furthermore, it did not establish a communication strategy to promote agrobiodiversity.",negative,4461
4462,"In particular, it can be observed that INIAP did not manage to pledge all of the cofinancing intended, particularly since 2016 due to budget restrictions and political changes that reduced its role in agricultural extension, particularly with regard to the transfer of technology.",negative,4462
4463,"It was also difficult to sign the LoA with the Heifer Foundation that, on the one hand, could not take on the role of service provider without prior training by FAO-EC and, on the other hand, continued in the Steering Committee subsequent to the decision to apply the DIM by FAO-EC which, in effect, resulted in the Foundation playing the role of both judge and defendant when it came to decision-making.",negative,4463
4464,"In addition, the internal monitoring system and the management of risks did not contribute to improving the efficiency of planning and implementation.",negative,4464
4465,"On the one hand, the monitoring and management of risks were focused on pursuing targets to fulfil the bureaucratic needs of the GEF and FAO.",negative,4465
4466,"On the other hand, the project did not establish sufficient coordination mechanisms to stimulate reflection on the outcomes, lessons learned and good practices to replicate.",negative,4466
4467,"In addition, the project did not manage to establish a communication strategy to promote passing this regulation and, according to evidence available, no mechanism or budget has been established to update, strengthen and broaden the main communications at an intra and inter-provincial level.",negative,4467
4468,"In fact the lack of communication at these levels, partly due to the lack of time and resources, has not triggered the catalytic effect of the project.",negative,4468
4469,"Due to a significant delay in starting the Project, the outputs are not being delivered as planned.",negative,4469
4470,The target outcomes are also not on track to be achieved by the project end date.,negative,4470
4471,"Although, the sociocultural context in Upper Egypt constrained FAO in organizing mixed groups of participants in the Farm Schools and Junior Farmer Field and Life Schools.",negative,4471
4472,"Nevertheless, the project did take the initiative to disseminate good agricultural practices.",negative,4472
4473,The projects have viewed the sector as passive recipient of information and knowledge generated by assessment of the selected value chains.,negative,4473
4474,"In short, substantive partnership between FAO and the private sector has a long way to materialize.",negative,4474
4475,"However, the figures are still over-estimated in many cases.",negative,4475
4476,There is a credibility risk if the expectations are raised too high.,negative,4476
4477,Their advocacy efforts are mainly targeting statisticians and other partners working with statistics.,negative,4477
4478,The network of FAO Decentralized Offices could be used to a greater extent to make the case for FIES in national policy circles.,negative,4478
4479,The same applies to development partners adopting FIES for project monitoring purposes.,negative,4479
4480,It is usually cheaper and easier to collect data at household level than at individual level.,negative,4480
4481,"While the household level supports some types of disaggregation (e.g. per income group or geographic area, or between male- and female- headed households), only data collected at the individual level would be able to reveal potential gender differences in access to food and to the resources necessary to produce or purchase it.",negative,4481
4482,"Vulnerability remains, despite project implementation, primarily due to isolated areas not easily accessible (i.e. during the rainy season in the different sections of Bainet commune).",negative,4482
4483,"This excluded some populations from participation and benefitting from markets, water and FFS.",negative,4483
4484,"Nevertheless, the project has experienced significant delays with the risk that participants lose interest and motivation.",negative,4484
4485,The project will have difficulties to trigger sustainable processes in the remaining year and a half.,negative,4485
4486,"However, climate change and gender (two cross-cutting issues under the current FAO Strategic Framework) were not adequately addressed.",negative,4486
4487,"The team also found that, except for several interventions that directly addressed irrigation and improved water practices, many interventions neglected water and its role in agricultural production systems.",negative,4487
4488,"However, FFS used a rather conservative approach, often delivering standard extension advice rather than creating a dynamic adaptive learning institution or community.",negative,4488
4489,"Furthermore, FFS had a limited focus on empowering the poor and landless.",negative,4489
4490,Monitoring at programme level was not carried out.,negative,4490
4491,This contributed to weak institutional memory.,negative,4491
4492,"The recording and documentation of gender and social inclusion was generally poor, and there was no follow-up of activities to understand the benefits received by the target populations.",negative,4492
4493,"Moreover, there were many missed opportunities for developing the resources and capacities of women.",negative,4493
4494,"The CPF did not provide a clear programmatic logic, nor a rationale for the individual and outcome level interventions.",negative,4494
4495,"During the CPF design process, FAO did not sufficiently involve all relevant government partners.",negative,4495
4496,"In its effort to meet the expected outcomes and deliver against plans, FAO did not systematically consider the complexity of the beneficiary population and often failed to design gender and socially inclusive interventions.",negative,4496
4497,"There was a lack of institutional capacity to address gender and social issues in policy, programmes and projects at the country level.",negative,4497
4498,Land remains a contentious issue in all the FPAM countries and the impacts of this on any similar project should not be underestimated.,negative,4498
4499,Political change remains an uncertainty in most countries.,negative,4499
4500,The government departments involved in the project are under-resourced and have relatively low capability compared to their mandates.,negative,4500
4501,"FAO also utilized the knowledge with local institutions, in particular those under National Agricultural Research System, by working with them.",negative,4501
4502,Knowledge flow within FAO (between headquarters and the Bangladesh Country Office) was more top-down than bottom-up.,negative,4502
4503,Knowledge from Bangladesh was not adequately fed into the global knowledge pool at headquarters.,negative,4503
4504,Insufficient attention to market aspects was partly due to the composition and dynamics of the project task force.,negative,4504
4505,These projects were led by technical officers with an agronomic background and no or insufficient technical inputs from those with economic backgrounds.,negative,4505
4506,Small-scale projects are most useful when used as a pilot activity or seed money for larger initiatives.,negative,4506
4507,This requires a clear exit or upscaling strategy at the design stage.,negative,4507
4508,"However, the exit or upscaling strategy was often detailed only during project implementation.",negative,4508
4509,Efforts to build the capacities of the non-G20 participating countries could have been more effective if based on an initial assessment.,negative,4509
4510,They also could have reached a broader outcome if deployed by trainings systematically in each country or regionally.,negative,4510
4511,The main shortcoming affecting the relevance of the projects evaluated was the decision to fund a large number of projects through two different funding windows at the same time.,negative,4511
4512,"This contributed to atomized funding, increased the risk of overlaps and affected the possibility of building mutually reinforcing synergies.",negative,4512
4513,"Furthermore, some overlaps were identified among projects (in terms of the countries covered) and the strategic action plans were formulated without information and data flows from the immediate action projects.",negative,4513
4514,"Furthermore, the vast majority of immediate action projects did not monitor the adaptability and productivity performance of PGRFA.",negative,4514
4515,"This represents a major shortcoming of the immediate action projects considering the high productivity rates of local varieties of beans, maize, millet, potato and sorghum, which could have been of great interest to other immediate action projects (especially in the same regions), and decision makers in building awareness at national level on the importance of PGRFA for sustainable livelihoods and climate change adaptation.",negative,4515
4516,Such awareness is considered crucial to mainstream PGRFA into major national development plans to ensure sustainability of projects funded.,negative,4516
4517,The monitoring of PGRFA performance is also important to upscale and replicate the interventions funded in different regions.,negative,4517
4518,"Presently the office relies on emergency work to cover its running costs, and on a share of project budget reserved for administrative and operational costs.",negative,4518
4519,The sustainability of this model is questionable.,negative,4519
4520,"However, there remain substantial gaps in gender mainstreaming, particularly at country level, due largely to the limited resources the agency has devoted to it and the weak understanding of gender by technical staff.",negative,4520
4521,"As a result, the consideration of the impacts on women and gender relations in project designs has been uneven or unclear.",negative,4521
4522,"Globally, FAO recognizes that climate change will adversely affect women more than men, but only one project in the 11 focus countries visited focused on addressing the specific issues that women face and developed their abilities in decision-making.",negative,4522
4523,This focus was possible in part due to NGO partner knowledge on the issues.,negative,4523
4524,"The agency has been less active, organized and strategic than it needs to be in utilizing potential opportunities for funding and developing common agendas with donors, member countries and development organizations.",negative,4524
4525,"Finally, the capacity in FAO is not in place yet for the agency to adequately address the challenge of climate change to agriculture and food security.",negative,4525
4526,"Considering the central role of the private sector in agriculture and value chains, there have been insufficient FAO partnerships with the sector on climate change.",negative,4526
4527,"Formal partnerships, subject to due diligence, are not the only option and informal partnerships have been encouraged.",negative,4527
4528,"On the other hand, although youth have been welcomed to participate and benefit from the project activities, the project design and implementation did not provide specific support to engage youth in agriculture.",negative,4528
4529,The same relates to illiterates and people with disabilities.,negative,4529
4530,"However, FNS strategy processes were late to begin, and therefore had not been completed by the time of the evaluation.",negative,4530
4531,"Lack of baseline FNS outcome data in the states, as well as lack of primary data collection at locality level, were among the weakest substantial elements of the FSPS- CB programme.",negative,4531
4532,Random actions in local communities caused delays that needed to be quickly resolved to minimise delays.,negative,4532
4533,The main gap in implementation was the oversight of upland rehabilitation work in river catchments.,negative,4533
4534,The evaluation found that the collaboration between FSNAU and FEWS NET had not resulted in added value or synergy (e.g. with regard to informing humanitarian responses).,negative,4534
4535,"On the contrary, the disagreement between the two parties on the analysis of the jointly collected data and the preparation of maps based on different timelines had the opposite effect, creating confusion among the stakeholders who utilized the analysis for emergency response.",negative,4535
4536,"Problems were observed, however, in relation to the nutrition data, as the survey results were not comparable with results for other countries.",negative,4536
4537,"Furthermore, the methodology related to data on stunting was questioned by some stakeholders; however, this appears to be more of a communication gap than a methodological problem.",negative,4537
4538,"In contrast, the evaluation found the approach to agriculture too narrow (including only cereal production), thereby leaving out important livelihood activities such as irrigation agriculture in pastoral societies.",negative,4538
4539,"The livelihood classification and related information was important, as it defines the response.",negative,4539
4540,"However, even in the current phase there is a funding gap of approximately USD 5 million (out of a total budget of USD 26.1 million); the next phase will likely face similar funding issues.",negative,4540
4541,"Hence, there is a need for FSNAU to streamline its operations.",negative,4541
4542,"KSA universities, of which there are many, produce large numbers of suitably qualified graduates who could occupy many of the positions currently taken by international experts.",negative,4542
4543,"Moreover, the technical advice being offered within the programme takes little account of major advances in production methods.",negative,4543
4544,"For example, more use should be made of the biotechnology facilities available in Al Hassa, and many additional technical advances in crop production could be taken advantage of.",negative,4544
4545,All projects had problems with FAO and MoEWA coordination and linkages.,negative,4545
4546,There were also limitations regarding the extent of cooperation and collaboration with local and foreign institutions and universities.,negative,4546
4547,"The research-training-extension model was not efficiently or effectively implemented, and there were major communication problems evident among partners.",negative,4547
4548,"However, in the implementation process, the approach to capacity development was not comprehensive and the focus remained on providing training.",negative,4548
4549,"Moreover, there was inadequate capacity building of local human resources and problems with FAO and MoEWA coordination and linkages.",negative,4549
4550,"Achievements in the other two aspects of capacity development remained modest because most of the outputs (e.g. recommendations of studies, frameworks and strategies) were not approved or adopted by MoEWA.",negative,4550
4551,"Furthermore, pro-poor approaches and gender mainstreaming were not always adequately considered at the design stage.",negative,4551
4552,The monitoring of progress towards gender equity and mainstreaming was missing.,negative,4552
4553,"Many continued to rely heavily on external financial assistance, in the form of free resources and materials from the government and FAO.",negative,4553
4554,"Moreover, the effectiveness of the handover process at provincial level was limited.",negative,4554
4555,"Poverty reduction objectives have more linkages with social protection interventions, and the support for productive enterprises to viable small and medium enterprise and value chain development.",negative,4555
4556,"Although policy issues were not a major focus of the project, they were important to achieving the project outcomes.",negative,4556
4557,"When the project was terminated, there was an impression that senior managers in provincial governments needed to be engaged in accordance with the norms of concluding such projects.",negative,4557
4558,"This was also central to post-project phase follow-ups, which senior provincial managers needed to support fully, particularly since there were resource implications associated with the new phase.",negative,4558
4559,"For example, it was evident that some issues related to conflicts within the beneficiary groups required action beyond the capacity of the project management to handle.",negative,4559
4560,These issues had implications on project sustainability.,negative,4560
4561,"With regard to the civil servants participating in the workshop, only very limited capacity, if any, appears to have been created.",negative,4561
4562,The evaluation met with several of these trainees during the mission and none of these appeared to have grasped the (complex) RtF concept.,negative,4562
4563,"The misapprehension that RtF implies that the government is responsible for feeding all people was found among MAFFS representatives, and this was one of the arguments of the government staff for not supporting the RtF.",negative,4563
4564,"Furthermore, the project is only partly adhering to the FAO Policy on Gender Equality.",negative,4564
4565,"Thus, the project is not based on an explicit gender analysis (but partially includes a gender analysis); and gender-related issues are only partially included in the implementation.",negative,4565
4566,"Due to the EVD, a no-cost extension was granted; however, even if some activities had been launched before the EVD crisis, conditions had changed and it was therefore not only a question of picking up the activities one year later.",negative,4566
4567,This in particular affected the district coordination mechanism.,negative,4567
4568,Developing a thematic CA project cluster in two neighbouring countries could have delivered significant and sustained synergy and some reduction in costs.,negative,4568
4569,"However, in practice this was not achieved.",negative,4569
4570,"There has been very limited assessment of seed security in these areas, except in Northern Bahr El Ghazal where the implementation of ITFs was well adapted to address lack of access to seed.",negative,4570

4572,"Locations chosen for seed relief interventions are presently based on food security information, which is not a relevant indicator for seed security.",negative,4572
4573,FAO has not developed specific targeting criteria or guidance for its IPs.,negative,4573
4574,"As a result targeting practice varies by agencies, although usually involves local leadership and sometimes a dedicated committee.",negative,4574
4575,This risks unreported or unnoticed exclusion of vulnerable households.,negative,4575
4576,"For example in the distribution of fishing kits, targeting was partly skills- based - households which have the capacity to fish.",negative,4576
4577,"But this risks excluding the most vulnerable, especially if they are not being reached with other forms of support.",negative,4577
4578,"Where there have been delays in implementation, for seed distribution and ITFs, effectiveness has been undermined.",negative,4578

4580,"Vaccination of as many animals as possible, as widely as possible, risks leaving herds susceptible to disease if herd immunity levels remain low and drug supply is inadequate.",negative,4580

4583,"In this context the role of the private sector deserves attention, especially in states less affected by the conflict, despite the challenges.",negative,4583
4584,"FAO must develop a policy on cost recovery, which could be the basis for future privatization, for example of veterinary services, drawing on the experience of ICRC, the other key actor in the livestock sector, and on OLS experience.",negative,4584

4596,"Whereas the case of citrus greening in Dominica highlights the importance of building capacities in pest management over the long-term, FAO has lacked a consistent strategy to address plant health in the region, and to monitor emerging and more traditional threats.",negative,4596
4597,"There was also limited FAO programmatic engagement on these issues, apart from two cases in Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda detailed in the report.",negative,4597

4674,"For example a flagship publication7 put out in September 2004 was issued as a SES product rather than an ILO-endorsed set of policies, however, with little clarity as to why this distinction was being made.",negative,4674
4675,"The publication posed challenges to the Office in handling how to distinguish between what was published work that was exploratory and innovative, but that did not represent ILO policy positions.",negative,4675
4676,"Had it been reviewed with the latter more in mind, it could have converted what is basically an important report raising serious issues into one that the ILO could safely share with the inter-governmental process.",negative,4676
4677,"However, some aspects of design could be improved primarily with respect to the scope of engagements and sequencing of activities.",negative,4677
4678,"Sometimes, insufficient attention is paid to the nature, magnitude and institutionalization of training for labour inspectors; the design of sanctions and associated administrative and judi- cial procedures; and the development of comprehensive strategies and operating plans for labour inspectorates.",negative,4678
4679,"From a broader institutional perspective, while the Office has established planning and control systems, some deficiencies are apparent.",negative,4679
4680,"These include: functional limitations in the Integrated Resource Information System (IRIS); the lack of inte- gration of planning, reporting and financial systems; and the absence of a mechanism to inde- pendently validate reported results.",negative,4680
4681,Well-defined outcomes and indicators are needed to ensure accountability and provide a basis for continuous improvement.,negative,4681
4682,While ILO seeks to support member States in keeping with international standards as reflected in Conventions Nos.,negative,4682
4683,"Achieving greater compliance with applicable laws and regulation is dependent on numerous social, political and economic factors; it requires actions across multiple fronts.",negative,4683
4684,"However, this is where the implementation of ILS outside the formal sector must make progress if they are to benefit a large proportion of the population.",negative,4684
4685,"At this stage without substantial extra funds, the Office can do little more than monitor and take on board good practice lessons from its own experiences.",negative,4685
4686,One must recognize that the resources of the Office are not sufficient for all of the mandates and actions it is requested to assume.,negative,4686
4687,Progress by consensus is always rather slow and there are some good signs that all parties appreciate the need for reform.,negative,4687
4688,"However, as long as the FPRW outcomes are mirrored in separate organizational units, the 2008 Declaration's policy call for synergy is the only overriding incentive for managers to blend and combine outcome-linked regular budget (RB) financing.",negative,4688
4689,Similar constraints do not exist for the use of extra-budgetary resources with various projects combining the principles within one project framework.,negative,4689
4690,These vary in depth and scope from project to project.,negative,4690
4691,There is no comprehensive strategy for mainstreaming FPRW into all of the Office's work despite the policy mandate in the 2008 Declaration.,negative,4691
4692,"However, a common strategy for all sectors of the Office aimed at achieving the long-term objectives of the resolution has not been developed.",negative,4692
4693,Such a strategy could have been of great use to the Office in realizing its commitment to results-based management.,negative,4693
4694,To this end planning of specific activities for the implementation of the overall strategy or the sub-strategies would be needed.,negative,4694
4695,A detailed strategy would reinforce the spirit of the conclusions drawn in the ILC resolution in 2004 and its call for a plan of action that takes into account the established elements.,negative,4695
4696,Still there were a number of interview responses stating that ILO had lost a significant amount of ground in OSH-related global issues.,negative,4696
4697,"The reasons the interviewees gave was the activity of other similarly oriented international organizations, the minimal agreements between many constituents which prohibit the ILO playing a more advanced role in OSH, a lack of collaboration between ILO and other global organizations, and missed opportunities to promote OSH to donor organizations.",negative,4697
4698,"Consequently, the formerly undisputed position of ILO as a global leader in OSH-related issues, and OSH standard setting, is likely to become increasingly vulnerable.",negative,4698
4699,It is the only UN system organization to follow this pattern.,negative,4699
4700,The location conveys an impression of lack of independence.,negative,4700
4701,"However, there is little effective connection between evaluation and results-based management within the Office.",negative,4701
4702,"Self-evaluation at the programme level is not as well developed as would be hoped, although a number of exercises show promise.",negative,4702
4703,"There have been training initiatives, but the results have been uneven and there is an expressed need for additional training at all levels, including for stakeholders.",negative,4703
4704,"While there has been an effort to engage stakeholders in a participatory process in evaluations, this has not always been considered satisfactory.",negative,4704
4705,"A second issue is the nature and unpredictability of exis- ting donor funding for social protection, which often results in rather small, short projects that are not conducive to supporting long-term processes of change.",negative,4705
4706,"Finally, in the absence of comprehensive capaci- ty-building strategies and systematic monitoring of progress, combined with high levels of staff turnover in key ministries, gains made in building local social protection capacity are under threat.",negative,4706
4707,The lowest level of coherence was found in countries that did not have formal ILO representation.,negative,4707
4708,"Here, project teams tend to run their projects separately, and there is less systematic coherence and coordination.",negative,4708
4709,In none of the cases reviewed were the DWCPs costed and anchored in budgets.,negative,4709
4710,"As a result, they are somewhat theoretical and, unless costed, cannot be the basis for realistic results-based management (RBM).",negative,4710
4711,These were mostly associated with delays in recruitment or procurement.,negative,4711
4712,"Some ILO TC project personnel, in countries lacking a country representative, were strongly critical of the difficulties they face because of their lack of authority over recruitment, procurement and financial management.",negative,4712
4713,This has proved particularly challenging in instances where their managers (based in other offices) are unavailable for long periods of time and have failed to nominate temporary replacements.,negative,4713
4714,"This results in infrequent or insufficient field missions, particularly with regard to country portfolio and policy development, and results in missed opportunities.",negative,4714
4715,It is for pro- gramme staff to develop relationships of trust and conduct a sustained policy dialogue under such condi- tions.,negative,4715
4716,"Furthermore, some project personnel perform representational and administrative support functions beyond their core responsibilities in countries without country directors, cutting into their core project management responsibilities.",negative,4716
4717,Coordination activities by YEP to support internal coherence and complementarity have been hindered by its limited empowerment and lack of dedicated human resources.,negative,4717
4718,"This is a major constraint in trying to technically anchor the large and growing portfolio of projects, people and agencies involved in ILO youth employment initiatives.",negative,4718
4719,"The degree of youth employment coordination among various ministries, government agencies and the social partners has been reported as generally low for many of the countries where the ILO is working on youth employment.",negative,4719
4720,"There are often conflicting priorities across ministries, which deter efforts to integrate approaches within the public sector.",negative,4720
4721,"A more strategic and results-oriented approach to decision-making on national interventions could contribute to increased effectiveness and target specialized needs (i.e. enlarged network of stakeholders, disadvantaged youth groups).",negative,4721
4722,"The multi-faceted character of interventions requires multi-disciplinary approaches, and this is why youth employment initiatives are normally multi-departmental.",negative,4722
4723,"The Youth Employment Programme is an important ILO resource to generate integration and coordination of interventions, but it lacks adequate dedicated resources and an administrative presence to create and manage a complex internal partnership arrangement.",negative,4723
4724,"As the lead technical UN agency, the ILO will have to develop not only the expertise but also the organizational and management systems to reduce the high transaction costs associated with multi-agency processes.",negative,4724
4725,"A specific responsibility and set of tools are needed to do this in the Office, which would enable YEP to better coordinate within its limited capacities.",negative,4725
4726,"On the negative side, the number of ILO projects that include gender equality in outcomes, outputs and activities has decreased over the Action Plan period.",negative,4726
4727,"Nearly three quarters of projects are classified with no or only few objectives, outcomes, outputs or activities to promote gender equality.",negative,4727
4728,Gender equality can sometimes be viewed as optional in technical cooperation or DWCPs (i.e. proposals are not rejected if gender equality is not addressed).,negative,4728
4729,"Nearly three quarters of projects are classified with no or only few objectives, outcomes, outputs or activities to promote gender equality.",negative,4729
4730,Gender equality can sometimes be viewed as optional in technical cooperation or DWCPs (i.e. proposals are not rejected if gender equality is not addressed).,negative,4730
4731,"Apart from appraising DWCP documents and planning technical cooperation projects, what the implementation of ILO initiatives matters.",negative,4731
4732,"However, given that, in opera- tional terms, ILO is not a humanitarian agency, it has often played a secondary role in the humanitarian field.",negative,4732
4733,"This has frequently resulted in: the marginalization of topics related to employment and social dia- logue in reconstruction plans; reduction in the amount of funds allocated to the topics covered by the ILO; insufficient involvement of the social partners in setting out strategies and reconstruction plans, recovery and development; and exclusion of ILO from the overall rebuilding process.",negative,4733
4734,"However, there is still some way to go before initiatives address gender as a force for change in development.",negative,4734
4735,"In a number of interventions, the participation of women is nominal, especially in some of the more male-dominated societies.",negative,4735
4736,"As highlighted in a number of evaluations, for example in Africa, the Americas and the Caucasus regions, obstacles and barriers are particularly strong in areas which have experienced civil strife or faced transitions to democracy.",negative,4736
4737,"Such countries often have only a weak social fabric and are characterized by other challenges, e.g. fragmentation within social partner organizations.",negative,4737
4738,"The need to have longer term commitments and a more incremental approach to achieving positive outcomes and sustainability was recommended in many reports related to capacity building and sound industrial relations (including non-ILO interventions, such as in the EU), particularly in countries where social dialogue and tripartism are facing substantial barriers.",negative,4738
4739,"In the context of labour law and labour administration, evaluations highlighted the insufficiency of ILO capacities, both at headquarters and in the field, as a crucial barrier to achieving better results.",negative,4739
4740,"Risks (external factors that can disturb or destroy an intervention) are often not considered, or if they are, then in overly optimistic ways.",negative,4740
4741,"The lead time to start up a project or other planned activity is typically underestimated, often leading to long delays and serious problems to arrive at completion, or even complete failure to deliver useful results.",negative,4741
4742,"The SFP has a special responsibility to deal with the apparent limited knowledge of SF in many TC projects and Country Offices, as well as perceptions by some that social finance is a Headquarters project.",negative,4742
4743,The Social Finance Network has played less of an integrating role than anticipated.,negative,4743
4744,"This reflects the knowledge and understanding of social finance at the field level, which is still too dependent on the professional background and interest of individual ILO staff members.",negative,4744
4745,The social finance concept has not yet sufficiently penetrated the ILO structures.,negative,4745
4746,It is a challenging task to move beyond assessing the achievements of individual projects to assessing the achievements in terms of DWCP outcomes.,negative,4746
4747,"To be able to do so, the DWCP evaluation framework needs to be thought through when the DWCP is being designed.",negative,4747
4748,"The use of annual progress and final reports to the donors and Programme Implementation Reports do not allow for critical and comprehensive analysis of results achieved, nor the identification of opportunities, and challenges.",negative,4748
4749,This limits the scope for improvement and discussion around possible synergies.,negative,4749
4750,"Many of the challenges related to a lack of dedicated staff to this project, coordinating across units at headquarters, as well as budgets and co-financing requirements.",negative,4750
4751,Management of the project often relied on the good will of country offices.,negative,4751
4752,"However, ensuring that W4Y was relevant as a discernible input into policy, programme or dialogue proved to be very challenging.",negative,4752
4753,The team found few instances where stakeholders saw the SWTS as an important input into the major government policy and program initiatives to youth employment.,negative,4753
4754,"While ILO and MCF have utilized and disseminated SWTS information there has to date been limited use of the SWTS microdata, SWTS reports and the YouthPOL database among global stakeholders.",negative,4754
4755,"The potential value (or impact) of the investment in assembling this global repository of detailed information will diminish over time unless there are additional efforts to: gather comparable information in more counties, gather comparable information in countries over time and expand the user base for the information.",negative,4755
4756,"Although gender issues have been identified in the Code of Practice, Recommendation 200 and other ILO documents, the ILO strategy on gender and HIV in the world of work is still not very strong.",negative,4756
4757,Isolated efforts have been undertaken but gender needs to be more solidly and explicitly integrated across HIV in the world of work programming.,negative,4757
4758,Monitoring tools and processes have not been sufficiently tailored to the needs of project implementers.,negative,4758
4759,The project does not integrate gender equality related objectives in the logframe at the design stage of the project.,negative,4759
4760,It also does not provide guidance on promoting cross-fertilization and collaboration with other outcomes.,negative,4760
4761,The DWCPs are the most effective vehicles for delivering ILO support to member States.,negative,4761
4762,"The employment-intensive construction methods are disadvantaged by long-held national and international concerns about the management intensity for government institutions and their contractors, and perceived risks linked to the relatively slow disbursement of funds.",negative,4762
4763,In some countries there are perceptions of the methodology being donor-driven rather than nationally owned.,negative,4763
4764,"Finally, corruption remains a major problem within infrastructure investment and there is some resistance to the increased transparency associated with these methods, particularly given the range of EIIS management tools for effective management and local governance.",negative,4764
4765,"There are wide disparities in the number of countries covered by each regional office (RO), Decent Work Technical Support Team (DWT) and by each country office (CO), as well as in the office architecture.",negative,4765
4766,"Constituents, staff and donors expressed concerns that the offices serving a large number of countries are unreasonably overstretched.",negative,4766
4767,There does not appear to be a systematic process for determining demand at country or regional levels although the process of developing DWCPs partly serves this purpose.,negative,4767
4768,"Whene- ver new technical needs emerge, the lack of agility or flexibility in the biennial budgetary and program- ming process, and lengthy recruitment and mobility processes, inhibit responsiveness.",negative,4768
4769,This is a major factor in determining whether or not the ILO is an effective partner in all UNCTs.,negative,4769
4770,Dispa- rity in the number of countries covered by offices in the field needs to be addressed to ensure quality and equitable delivery of services.,negative,4770
4771,This is in part explained by the fact that the implementation of the MCOF at these levels does not always imply additional allocation of resources.,negative,4771
4772,"However, as the MCOF is a tool for fostering improved internal coordination and programmatic coherence at all levels, a strengthening of the internal coordination mechanisms and the allocation of resources on a consistent and ongoing basis are required for undertaking comprehensive assessments and developing response strategies at different stages of a crisis with mobility dimensions, including in anticipation of or in the wake of a crisis situation.",negative,4772
4773,"The report notes, however, that, with the expansion of the Facility, the number of projects to review, comment on and submit to the IOM Director General for approval has been increasing.",negative,4773
4774,"Furthermore, the improved management, through the creation of two databases that require constant monitoring, information sharing with IOM Member States and the monitoring of information exchanges with IOM Missions on project endorsement and implementation, has put pressure on the two IOM staff in charge of the Facility.",negative,4774

4779,"Apart from neighbourhood opposition, the municipal and national elections and the referendum, a difficult economic situation in the country additionally prolonged the efficient Open Centre set up.",negative,4779
4780,"Capital controls following the parliamentary elections in September 2015 disrupted procurement, contracting and refurbishing procedures.",negative,4780
4781,"At Headquarter level, the private sector liaison team in the Donor Relations Department (DRD) remains small with the Head also having other donor liaison functions.",negative,4781
4782,"Overall, there are limited dedicated human resources for private sector and most of the interviewees considered it to be inadequate particularly for an Organization that is highly dependent on fundraising and voluntary contributions.",negative,4782
4783,"There are however other efforts such as knowledge management, which were not implemented (due mostly to lack of human and financial resources), putting sustainability efforts at risk.",negative,4783
4784,The lack of commitment for predictable funding is a major obstacle to both ensuring outcomes are met and that they become sustainable.,negative,4784
4785,"No. 12 was also awaited since November 2017 due to the donor considering new funding and an extension until the end of 2018, allowing the implementation of additional activities.",negative,4785
4786,The modification of the cooperative agreement was finalized in May 2018.,negative,4786
4787,"One of the main reasons for the difficulty in obtaining reimbursements is the lack of interest of IOM donors in reimbursing amounts used for evacuations, which represented 71 per cent of the funds to be repaid as at 31 December 2015.",negative,4787
4788,Another reason is the reluctance of donors to use their contributions for retroactive reimbursements of operations funded by MEFM.,negative,4788
4789,The areas which require some improvements are those related to the implementation of the community plans and ensuring that proper responsibility and monitoring is conducted to track the plans.,negative,4789
4790,"Based on focus group discussions, some communities highlighted that their expectations were not met and that they were not aligned with what IOM had intended to provide.",negative,4790
4791,The further breakdown and single counting still does not allow for insight into the scale of the adoption of change or the implementation of agreed action.,negative,4791
4792,The new indicator set focusses more on the implementation phase (outcomes) as opposed to a mix of adoption and implementation in the old set.,negative,4792
4793,"A connected issue is the tension between the normative role UN Environment Programme as a whole is designed to play, and the operational role it has in practice.",negative,4793
4794,"Because of the normative focus, any substantive changes that are achieved in practice may go unreported.",negative,4794
4795,This criterion includes consideration of partner and stakeholder engagement in the period between project approval and mobilisation.,negative,4795
4796,The issue of stakeholder participations could be more closely associated with a weak demand-driven approach than during actual project implementation.,negative,4796
4797,"As a result, the project entered into the Project Information Management System often does not entirely match the work delivered or is delivered via multiple, often separate, donor- funded projects.",negative,4797
4798,The existence of more than one set of project results (one reviewed and approved internally and another forming a commitment to a donor) poses challenges for accountability and weakens the potential for the demonstration of performance.,negative,4798
4799,The first was the question of prioritisation of activities as a means to limit the effects of funding shortfalls on PoW delivery.,negative,4799
4800,"While simple prioritisation of activities would certainly guide allocation of MTF resources and fundraising activities in the short term, views remain polarised regarding the wider question of the scope of work and whether this should be tailored to available resource).",negative,4800
4801,The second was the question of how to improve the ratio between administrative and programme costs.,negative,4801
4802,"Mechanisms for gender mainstreaming have been put in place in some of the core areas of UNEPs work, but, these are not yet robust enough to ensure compliance and a meaningful integration of gender perspectives into operational or programmatic areas of work.",negative,4802
4803,"The low level of resource allocation from core funds and external funds mobilization, low awareness level of staff regarding the GePA, insufficient commitment by management and staff to promote meaningful gender mainstreaming, and inadequate mechanisms for ensuring results suggest that gender mainstreaming in UNEP is not yet sustainable.",negative,4803
4804,The implementation of the GePA has been weakened by a number of constraints.,negative,4804
4805,Some of these weaknesses are strategic and can be traced back to the very core of the UNEP gender equality mandate and the strategy it has adopted to operationalize this mandate.,negative,4805
4806,Other weaknesses are more operational and relate more to institutional arrangements and implementing mechanisms adapted to support gender mainstreaming institutionally and operationally.,negative,4806
4807,The context is unclear: there is no statement as to how gender equality and equity should be understood in UNEP and how it applies to UNEP work.,negative,4807
4808,There is also no vision statement to create an institutional value and a sense of direction and opportunity for gender equality and equity.,negative,4808
4809,"Hence, many GFPs are inactive.",negative,4809
4810,"The role of the SGA, gender coordinators and GFPs also need to be revisited.",negative,4810
4811,The GePA has not consistently indicated expected outcomes and outputs of these partnerships.,negative,4811
4812,"And, UNEP partnership policy has not defined the framework for engagement of partners on gender and environmental issues.",negative,4812
4813,"But, UNEP is having difficulty in successfully demonstrating its contribution to this endeavour.",negative,4813
4814,"UNEP projects are unable to demonstrate their contribution to promoting gender equality mainly due to lack of substantive gender considerations in the project design and implementation, lack of sex-disaggregated and gender-specific information in monitoring and reporting, and lack of attention to gender dimensions in UNEP evaluations.",negative,4814
4815,"This lack of authority can; impede SPCs from getting access to progress information from other divisions, limit their ability to influence project and programme design processes and constrain their influence on resource allocation decisions to pursue alignment with subprogramme priorities.",negative,4815
4816,"Their ability to ensure that actions are taken to mitigate corporate risks to subprogramme implementation is also weak, especially when actions are required beyond the Lead Division.",negative,4816
4817,SPCs currently lack access to budgetary resources to perform coordination duties unless they happen to hold other substantive responsibilities that can afford them some flexibility in this regard.,negative,4817
4818,It would seem that the resource allocation trends associated with the former divisional structure prior to 2010 have been used to guide allocation of the Environment Fund.,negative,4818
4819,"Relative priorities across thematic Subprogrammes, Expected Accomplishments and PoW Outputs are difficult to discern and lack any written justification.",negative,4819
4820,QAS did provide project document templates and useful feedback on draft project design documents.,negative,4820
4821,QAS also facilitated an important project review process to raise quality at entry.,negative,4821
4822,"However, there was no up-to-date programme manual to serve as a reference to project designers and training for staff involved in project design was found inadequate.",negative,4822
4823,These factors might all have contributed to the high heterogeneity in the quality of the project design documents reviewed by this evaluation.,negative,4823
4824,"In a few cases, milestones refer to external events which would have happened anyway.",negative,4824
4825,"Improvements in the articulation of project milestones to better capture the intended project causality, coupled with monitoring of the achievement of project milestones scheduled in any given reporting period, would yield a robust and objectively verifiable reporting approach that would be easily incorporated into the approach used in current PPR process.",negative,4825
4826,A lack of detail in project documents on stakeholders often goes hand-in-hand with poorly articulated outreach and dissemination strategies.,negative,4826
4827,It is also important to note that project designs often articulate the intent to hire new staff for constituting the project management teams instead of relying on staff available in partner institutions.,negative,4827
4828,"At the time of project approval, a significant number of projects had mobilized none, or very small proportions, of the required project funds.",negative,4828
4829,The single most important deficiency is the absence of any quantification of Environment Fund financial or staff resources that will be required for project implementation.,negative,4829
4830,This deficiency is because the UN accounting systems (IMIS) cannot handle allocating Environment Fund (EF) resources to projects.,negative,4830
4831,The idea of allocating EF in projects was part of the original plan but had to be abandoned.,negative,4831
4832,"Replication of project results is most often expected to happen simply through communication and awareness raising (websites, policy briefs, lessons learned papers etc.).",negative,4832
4833,"Those activities are, in most cases, poorly spelled out and insufficiently resourced for replication to stand a good chance of success.",negative,4833
4834,Most project designs lack adequate baselines and very few specify activities to establish baselines and conduct recurrent monitoring.,negative,4834
4835,Milestones that capture progress to higher results levels are usually missing.,negative,4835
4836,The narrative description and logframes presented in the project document frequently made no mention of the activities that were listed as CSFs.,negative,4836
4837,"Sometimes, important risks were presented as Critical Success Factors (and vice versa).",negative,4837
4838,Approved PoW projects lack adequate detail on the strategies to be employed to sustain project outcomes.,negative,4838
4839,"Exit strategies are either ignored or implicit, and this is a serious shortcoming.",negative,4839
4840,"However, the evaluation found that, in comparison to some other UN Agencies, UNEP struggles to fully embrace operating under One UN at the country level.",negative,4840
4841,The track record of relevance to United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) is inconsistent and is highly dependent on the individuals in regional offices and relationship with relevant government and UN counterparts (see recommendation 9).,negative,4841
4842,"There does not appear to be a clear approach on engagement with particular countries, nor a coherent strategy for identifying potential new partner countries, nor a great attention for possible synergies at the regional level.",negative,4842
4843,"Countries are targeted by donors and aid agencies under their respective strategies and programmes of work (ADB, World Bank, EU, bilaterals, etc), and, therefore, even though requests come from the countries or regional offices, funding is only made available through a process of coordination between countries, UNEP and the respective donors.",negative,4843
4844,"In addition, projects miss opportunities to reorient and better focus on achieving intended changes by not regularly incorporating assumptions and drivers into planning and implementation.",negative,4844
4845,There is typically no risk management process or system in place for UNEP projects.,negative,4845
4846,"However, stakeholder involvement, especially at the country level, could be stronger during the design stage of projects.",negative,4846
4847,This is often limited due to budget constraints at the project design stage.,negative,4847
4848,Umbrella projects did not present a Theory of Change explaining the coherence between their sub-projects and sub-project results were difficult to identify and track for the purposes of learning and accountability.,negative,4848
4849,Output milestones and targets developed for the umbrella projects were quite meaningless for monitoring progress at the level of the individual sub-projects.,negative,4849
4850,It has been decided in UNEP discourage the submission of umbrella projects from 2014 onwards.,negative,4850
4851,"In order to support the geographically dispersed efforts, when the CCSP was first launched, climate change experts were placed in each of the regional offices.",negative,4851
4852,"However, to date, not all ROs retain these Regional CC Coordinators, and other Regional Office staff sometimes step in for CCSP coordination, with technical support from project staff.",negative,4852
4853,DTIE as the Lead Division makes the final budgetary decisions.,negative,4853
4854,There is a strong perception that DTIE abused its budget control to acquire a relatively larger amount of Environment Fund financing for its projects.,negative,4854
4855,The evaluation was unable to find evidence that this was really the case but this perception of unfairness creates mistrust and disincentives for collaboration.,negative,4855
4856,DTIE has the responsibility of coordination and allocation of funding for the CCSP but without an accountability mechanism.,negative,4856
4857,Staff report that they manage the lack of clear authority by knowing how to navigate the systems in place and meet administrative requirements.,negative,4857
4858,Some teams expected to be budgeted under the CCSP between 2010-13 ended up assigned with responsibilities for only a minimal activity budget.,negative,4858
4859,"Those teams were incentivized to find other means to create financial leeway or leverage external resources when possible, and also to take cost-saving measures, but this also led to a prioritization of engagement with partners who can provide funding or other forms of cost-saving.",negative,4859
4860,"The CCSP as a whole is chronically stifled by staff shortages, largely due to vacancies that remain open due to the slow recruitment process.",negative,4860
4861,"As many global programmes reach periods of expansion, so too will technical assistance demands increase as new countries begin implementation.",negative,4861
4862,Staff shortages mean UNEP cannot be in regular attendance at all key political meetings and is sometimes unable to embrace important opportunities to strategize or form collaborative relationships with new partners.,negative,4862
4863,"Also, the lack of staff funded by reliable sources (both extra-budgetary funding and Environment Fund funding appear unreliable) has meant relatively high rates of fluctuation of team sizes and turnover in some units, many of whom have lost more than half their original number since 2010.",negative,4863

4894,EAs have been reformulated and there is considerable rearrangement of PoW Outputs under the three new EAs.,negative,4894
4895,"In addition, there seems to be a lack of understanding among some staff on the thinking behind Sub-programme design and how their projects and interventions fit within the Sub-programme architecture and, for that matter, the UNEP PoW, because there was little to no participation by programme officers in Sub-programme design.",negative,4895

4910,"Generally, the projects do not include baseline studies mainly because there is no funding for project design.",negative,4910
4911,The reports reviewed for this evaluation show that Sub-programme performance reporting is done mostly at the output level because output monitoring was an easier task and the achievement of outputs became a proxy for the achievement of EAs.,negative,4911

4935,"It is hard to see an overall programme logic emerging from the project documents, except in very broad terms.",negative,4935
4936,Causal or other linkages between programme components have not been thoroughly pondered and synergies and complementarities between the different components are poorly explained.,negative,4936

4943,"It is clear from the case studies that at least some EMSP projects will need continued investment and commitment from UNEP or partners for some years for project results to become sustainable, although it is often unclear how this would be achieved or who should be responsible (again a reflection of the lack of an exit strategy).",negative,4943
4944,"Also, judging from the case studies, some EMSP projects did not implement the governance structures envisaged in project documents (such as project steering committees), which has sometimes jeopardised the prospects for sustainability, particularly of local results, although there were exceptions, notably the TEEB.",negative,4944
4945,"The lack of specific funding for stakeholder involvement at the project development phase also undermines ownership, and ultimately sustainability, and needs to be addressed by UNEP (see Recommendation 12 below).",negative,4945

4952,"Lesson learning is poor and inconsistent across the Subprogramme, with very little interaction and learning between the different projects in the EMSP and sharing expertise is weak to the point where some projects are operating as silos (reflecting an organizational level problem).",negative,4952
4953,Lesson learning has been further weakened by the failure to deliver a key EMSP-level learning project.,negative,4953
4954,"There is no real format or process to capture and formalise lessons learned and more guidance is needed on this, including clarity over what the purpose of these lessons are and who is supposed to learn them.",negative,4954
4955,"At the same time, projects implemented in a particular country have sometimes been designed as separate interventions with few if any linkages, and there is little sense of a coherent portfolio of EMSP projects at country level.",negative,4955

4958,"Whilst the evaluation was not able to assess budgets at PoW output level, some PoW outputs had no associated projects while others had as many as five contributing projects during both biennia, suggesting an unbalanced distribution of funding between PoW outputs.",negative,4958
4959,This has limited the ownership of project designs although local partnerships were usually developed at a later date once financing is secured.,negative,4959
4960,"Also, the attention given to building strategic partnerships to promote dissemination, replication and up-scaling of the results of local demonstrations and pilots was sometimes insufficient.",negative,4960

5171,"In addition, the project provides solutions for community-based management of mangrove ecosystems.",positive,5171
5172,"Indeed, this issue of community-based management of mangrove ecosystems was not taken into account in community forest management norms in Cameroon before the implementation of this project.",positive,5172
5173,The project also transferred knowledge and skills to the different actors involved in the economic sectors of the different intervention zones through several studies and training.,positive,5173
5174,"In addition, the project filled an important gap in the Manual of Procedures for the Attribution and Norms for the Management of Community Forests by taking into account the specific management of mangroves at community level.",positive,5174
5175,It is in this perspective that the project facilitated the establishment of the first community mangrove forest in Cameroon.,positive,5175

5249,"It has contributed to build capacities at both individual and organizational level creating the potential for change by helping niche partnerships prioritize challenges and develop detailed action plans to address them, where capacity development interventions can make a significant difference.",positive,5249
5250,TAPipedia has been launched as a capacity development portal in support of the Common Framework and TAP.,positive,5250
5251,"In some countries, the selection of niches was nevertheless influenced by political considerations and was not fully transparent or inclusive.",positive,5251
5252,Several countries have chosen to work with more than the two or three recommended niche partnerships with possible detrimental results through dilution of support given to each one.,positive,5252
5253,"Despite the project not implicitly targeting marginalized groups in its design, both indigenous and marginalized groups have benefited from the activities and will do so in the future, as members of the selected niches and through the implementation of the niche action plans.",positive,5253
5254,"In particular, the project addressed their working conditions to some extent.",positive,5254
5255,The operationalization of the CCA approach was carried out in a participatory and cross-sectoral manner.,positive,5255
5256,It resulted in the list of good agricultural practices mentioned above.,positive,5256
5257,"The project team has also been involved in multiple public and private development programmes and projects, which testifies to the quality of their services and ensures certain continuity of capacity in the post-project facilitation of FFS and CCA.",positive,5257
5258,The project has been implemented over the period 2011-2016 according to the pre-established logical framework and it produced the expected results with regard to the development and integration of climate change adaption policies and agricultural programmes.,positive,5258
5259,"Today, CCA is an integral part of all programmes and projects in the agricultural sector.2",positive,5259
5260,"Moreover, the FFS approach was adopted by several programmes and projects in the field without a true prior consultation at national level (for example, ICRISAT, World Vision, PASSIP).",positive,5260
5261,"In fact, the diffusion of the approach was carried out in these cases by the intermediary for FFS facilitators at field level.",positive,5261
5262,"Regional networks of facilitators, who were supported by the project, played an important role in consolidation.",positive,5262
5263,"This includes FAO interventions in policy support, nutrition, rice and oil seed, integrated pest management and food safety.",positive,5263
5264,Emergency and relief interventions clearly responded to government priorities.,positive,5264
5265,"As a global Organization with a long history of delivering technical cooperation programmes in Myanmar, FAO has considerable credibility with the government.",positive,5265

5272,The project established very good and effective working relations with the beneficiary communities.,positive,5272
5273,"In all the target countries, the project teams made concerted efforts to ensure that they consulted with and informed the communities and customary land owners before beginning any work, to ensure they fully understood the background to project ideas and were allowed to reach consensus and make decisions according to their customary systems of decision-making.",positive,5273
5274,"The overall focus of the project remained relevant for the duration of the project, with some minor adjustment at national level to planned activities.",positive,5274
5275,"This conclusion speaks to the overall robustness of the original design of the project given that the region (and the project) has experienced numerous severe weather events (see Appendix 12), other natural disasters, political changes (particularly in Fiji) and the fact that a long period of time elapsed between development of the original idea for the project (2007) and its final approval (2011).",positive,5275
5276,"In achieving its global environment objective and project development objective, the project supported the publication of a wide range of important baseline and other documents and created a comprehensive online archive (146 articles in total listed in Appendix 6).",positive,5276
5277,These will form an important legacy of the project if they are archived securely and made available to the public.,positive,5277

5281,"FAO made a distinctive contribution to food and nutrition security and food safety, in which sequenced projects provided holistic and long-term support.",positive,5281
5282,Another important role of FAO was in conveying important information and advocacy.,positive,5282
5283,"The Organization established its reputation as an honest broker in some critical areas, including nutrition, food safety and climate-smart agriculture.",positive,5283
5284,"Large donors continued providing resources for new projects, as FAO had lived up to its reputation as a technical agency in delivering quality programmes.",positive,5284
5285,"In some areas (e.g. nutrition, food safety, climate-smart agriculture), FAO paved the way for policy dialogu",positive,5285
5286,"It contributed to FAO SO4 by improving the quality and availability of updated information and analysis, enabling government and national stakeholders to design and implement efficient and inclusive market strategies (e.g. harmonization, private stock estimation).",positive,5286
5287,"The project also contributed to the Global AMIS third pillar by strengthening country capacities, which will improve forecasting in the future.",positive,5287
5288,"Through the support provided by the grant, the supply of timely and relevant market information has increased.",positive,5288
5289,"It took time and effort, but activities financed through the DGF also helped in encouraging stakeholders to increasingly participate and contribute to AMIS.",positive,5289
5290,There is overall satisfaction over the convening role the Secretariat played.,positive,5290
5291,There is also an overall stakeholder perception that AMIS is a good example of a multilateral initiative producing concrete results for a reasonable cost.,positive,5291
5292,"There was evidence of strengthening the institutional coordination, standards and regulation setting mechanisms; technical capacities in analysis, surveillance and inspection; consumer awareness; and grassroots adoption of good practices resulting in food safety.",positive,5292
5293,"These results are attributable to FAO interventions, which benefitted from the contribution of implementing partners.",positive,5293
5294,"This included preliminary analyses, vulnerability assessments and field trials to identify appropriate actions and target groups in both, strategic action plans and immediate action projects.",positive,5294
5295,"As a result, all projects were found to be aligned with both the provisions of the Treaty and other international agreements and conventions including Millennium Development Goals, Convention of Biological Diversity and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",positive,5295
5296,"However, the evaluation did identify cases where funded projects are helping to forge new alliances between farmers, NGOs and breeders in the interests of reducing dependency on traditional actors in PGRFA (namely public institutions that have diminishing resources).",positive,5296
5297,Immediate action projects have experienced difficulties in securing adequate funds since project closure.,positive,5297
5298,"However, few of these interventions were designed to address longer term climate change adaptation in an innovative way.",positive,5298
5299,"Give the financial limitations of the Organization, they also had limited geographic reach, only a small subset of communitylevel projects used information on climate projections and evidence of adaptation or mitigation success, and showed upscaling prospects and influence on policy.",positive,5299
5300,The agency has also moved emergency and DRR measures further in the direction of long-term adaptation in these and other countries through the coordination of and influence on coordination clusters that are typically set up in emergency responses.,positive,5300
5301,"In Africa, FAO has provided guidance for mainstreaming CCAM into programmes at the regional and subregional levels.",positive,5301
5302,"In the Haiyan response, mainstreaming adaptation was difficult due to the sudden onset of the disaster, short-term nature of the projects, and lack of clarity on how the resilience concept was to be applied at field level, but was achieved to a notable degree.",positive,5302
5303,FAO has largely pursued adaptation and mitigation separately from one another in its range of CCAM interventions.,positive,5303
5304,"Member countries, while being interested in how mitigation and adaptation can benefit each other, have done the same and placed greater priority on adaptation.",positive,5304
5305,Increased availability of and access to water for crop farming has made it possible for beneficiary communities to more easily adopt climate smart crop cultivation.,positive,5305
5306,"As a result, not only has production increased, but small-scale irrigation systems have also been adopted and extensive cultivation of different types of crops undertaken year-round in places where this was previously considered untenable.",positive,5306
5307,The resulting access to loans from the VSLAs was a major contributing factor to increased production and productivity levels during the project period.,positive,5307
5308,"Likewise, the project led to an increase in the land area covered by tree vegetation, which has a positive impact on the micro-climate in those areas with bio-energy plantations; moreover, beneficiaries have acquired the skills to establish and manage tree nurseries and tree planting as private business enterprises.",positive,5308
5309,"Afterward, women have progressively become more committed than men to attend FFS and implement the practices learned.",positive,5309
5310,"Positive gender results were observed particularly in relation to the coffee production activities, where men and women are now sharing planning and working tasks more equitably, both in the field and within their families.",positive,5310
5311,Positive results have started to emerge and the most progress was made in relation to coffee plantations.,positive,5311
5312,The needs and concerns of vulnerable groups like youth and children were addressed by the project indirectly.,positive,5312
5313,"Moreover, research on the drivers of FNS in context was an innovative programme design element of FSPS-CB, which contributed to context-sensitive and improved design of stakeholder interventions.",positive,5313

5324,"While some replication was taking place in targeted countries by the end of the project, sharing the project results more widely among the countries and in the region would increase the potential for replication.",positive,5324
5325,Members of the Food Security Cluster (approximately 90-100) depended on the seasonal assessments for their emergency response.,positive,5325
5326,The data was also used for monitoring and validation of targeting.,positive,5326
5327,"The livelihood baseline reports were used for programming, food security analysis and early warning response.",positive,5327

5329,"Taken together, these activities will help to upgrade the veterinary health delivery system in KSA so that it complies with international standards set by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and FAO.",positive,5329
5330,"Likewise, the environmental rehabilitation projects made significant progress.",positive,5330
5331,The project focused on technical skills necessary for primary production.,positive,5331
5332,This approach has its merits in view of the well-documented production challenges facing smallholder farmers in South Africa.,positive,5332
5333,"FAO successfully applied its core competency as a facilitator, bringing government and academic parties together to broker the establishment of the Institute for Development Assistance Management (IDAM).",positive,5333
5334,The institute has since become a flagship initiative.,positive,5334
5335,"The capacity of taskforce group members was enhanced in terms of (i) making quality comments on FSN Strategy and Planning and Implementation Manual, and holding discussions more focused on specific problems; and (ii) preparing logframes for FSN.",positive,5335
5336,"The capacity of the M&E system was improved for collecting FSN data, managing the database, as guided by the result frame, and analysing policy gaps at the ministry.",positive,5336
5337,Extension workers are now better equipped and have better knowledge and skills with which to address the FSN issues of farmers through supervision and guidance to CIGs.,positive,5337
5338,"A district development plan was developed, bringing related stakeholders together based on the baseline information in the project districts.",positive,5338
5339,"The plan is more realistic than before, as it was planned based on recent statistics and with participatory demand driven planning implementation and monitoring.",positive,5339
5340,DAIL and DRRD were found to be working together in the district as service providers.,positive,5340
5341,"The strengthened coordination contributed to plan, initiate and implement some joint activities for the improved household food security and nutrition.",positive,5341
5342,"The Secretariat has five core staff (national coordinator, M&E officer, technical staff, and administrator) and two vehicles.",positive,5342
5343,"The SUN Movement in Sierra Leone is organized within five networks: Government, Civil Society Organizations, Business, Donors and UN System.",positive,5343
5344,UNICEF is the focal point and FAO is the alternate focal point.,positive,5344
5345,"According to the informants, the project has been instrumental in revitalizing the stalled UN-network activities and ensuring current functionality.",positive,5345
5346,An example of the work of the SUN secretariat is the Position Paper on inclusion of RtF in the national constitution.,positive,5346
5347,"Hence, the project was only one out of several stakeholders being involved in and supporting the establishment and consolidation of the Secretariat.",positive,5347
5348,"MAFFS (through Women in Agriculture and Nutrition, WIAN) is for instance now planning to have nutritionists in all districts (there are 13 districts in the country).",positive,5348
5349,"So far, one nutritionist has been employed in Western Area.",positive,5349
5350,At district level there is also an increased understanding of the importance of food based approaches as interviews carried out during the evaluation witnessed about.,positive,5350
5351,"The inclusion of a budget for nutrition in MAFFS in one of the visited districts, Kambia (however small) indicates an enhanced capacity for pro-actively using this understanding at a political level.",positive,5351

5359,The other districts have MAFFS nutrition focal persons.,positive,5359
5360,"Seconding a nutritionist to WIAN section under the Extension Division in MAFFS has been instrumental in raising awareness of nutrition in the Ministry, but it has also contributed to strengthening the gender aspect of food and nutrition security.",positive,5360
5361,"Hence training has been conducted of women farmer groups, training on food utilization, etc.",positive,5361
5362,Mainstreaming nutrition into national agricultural policies implicitly has a gender aspect as women are being singled out as particularly vulnerable.,positive,5362
5363,"With regard to the community level activities, the majority of the targeted farmers are women (e.g. in the Mother-to-Mother support groups).",positive,5363

5403,The recently published Impact Assessment of the CAHW Intervention in Dolow indicates that CAHWs are having a positive impact on communities.,positive,5403
5404,"Data gathered indicates that CAHWs are accessing drugs and services through linkages to the South-West Livestock Professional Association (SOWELPA, supported by FAO) agro-vets; are charging fees for services and drugs, and therefore increasing their chances of sustainability in a private sector market; and are improving the health of herds (camels, goats, cattle) through services and simple surgery (e.g. dehorning).",positive,5404
5405,Enhancing the entrepreneurial skill of CAHWs will further strengthen their service delivery capabilities and the sustainability of their operations for the betterment of their communities.,positive,5405
5406,"Farmer Field Schools, Water Committees and Fishing Cooperatives are examples of community groups with which FAO is working directly and building capacity not only for the sake of improved relationships with FAO, but also for the sake of the community group itself to better perform for its constituents or members.",positive,5406
5407,Another example is the work of the FAO livestock sector with CAHWs in the South Central region.,positive,5407
5408,"FFS use a cascading model whereby a master trainer (lead farmer) is trained (often along with Ministry of Agriculture extension workers, where appropriate) and those master trainers, usually a farmer from a particular district, then train other farmers in the community.",positive,5408

5852,"Together with a working group and the Steering Committee for the project, a list of 37 good agricultural practices was defined, which serve as adaptation measures on the basis of accommodating a more restricted agricultural calendar and the retention of rainwater.",neutral,5852
5853,The list includes any practice which causes an increase in agricultural production without harming the environment.,neutral,5853
5854,"Since the formulation of the project in 2008, many things have changed in Mali in respect of integrating adaptation to climate change in policies.",neutral,5854
5855,"As part of the 2007 implementation of the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) for Climate Change, Mali created the Agency for Environment and Sustainable Development (AEDD) in 2010, and then adopted a National Policy on Climate Change in 2011.",neutral,5855
5856,"Based on the evidence collected throughout the evaluation process, the Final Evaluation drew several conclusions, which have been organized around the order of the evaluation questions raised in the Terms of Reference (Annex 1).",neutral,5856
5857,The order does not imply any priority from 1 to 9.,neutral,5857
5858,Public policy responses to these challenges are already considering rethinking the role of agriculture.,neutral,5858

5860,"Addressing the future challenges of enhancing domestic food grain productivity, achieving food security and decreasing nutrition deficiency will continue to be important for future FAO programmes.",neutral,5860
5861,"The SDGs set new development milestones for 2030, which will require additional investments in developing countries.",neutral,5861
5862,"At the same time, the attainment of middle-income country status will affect the level of overseas development assistance to future programmes (which are balanced by a compensatory adjustment of domestic resources or concessional borrowings to fund nationally owned mainstream programmes).",neutral,5862
5863,This will alter the modality of technical cooperation.,neutral,5863
5864,"Considering these points, FAO needs to rethink its niche and explore new partnership modalities in the new environment.",neutral,5864
5865,"With the government increasingly moving to national execution modalities and a larger proportion of self-financing for development priorities, the profile of technical assistance and capacity development needs will change.",neutral,5865
5866,Capacity development demands on specialized agencies such as FAO will likely become more nuanced and may require new approaches and modalities for technical assistance design and management.,neutral,5866
5867,"It is a custodian agency for 21 SDG indicators1 , for which it is responsible for compiling data from countries while also supporting national capacities for data collection.",neutral,5867

5877,Conclusion 1.,neutral,5877
5878,Finding 2: It is through engaging with Government at country level that FAO can bring the greatest contributions on CCAM.,neutral,5878
5879,"However, the engagement of FAO Representations with governments and development partners on climate change as it relates to the agricultural sectors and food security has overall been modest due to capacity limitations on climate issues in FAO Country Offices.",neutral,5879
5880,"In the UNFCCC, FAO has brought greater attention to the role of the agricultural sectors in CCAM through the knowledge it has provided at the sessions.",neutral,5880
5881,"Negotiators, however, have not benefited as much from their brief interactions with FAO as they would from in-depth information events outside the meetings.",neutral,5881
5882,"The analytical support, tools and data provided to member countries by FAO have been of substantial quality and have strengthened national knowledge and data systems for CCAM.",neutral,5882
5883,"While FAO has a clear comparative advantage in this area, it has not sufficiently sought to develop the capacity of member countries in CCAM analysis and knowledge generation.",neutral,5883
5884,"While developing policies for CCAM should remain an important goal for FAO, its highest valued added lies in aligning and harmonizing the climate change and DRR strategies, policies and systems of government agencies and other partners.",neutral,5884
5885,"There is much need for such work at the national level in member countries and at the sub-national one (where under decentralized political systems CCAM strategies are to be developed and capacities to address the issue improved) which FAO has an opportunity to address in the future, particularly in the SIDS.",neutral,5885
5886,The agency will need to achieve a greater understanding and consensus on climate change adaptation if it is to be more effective in supporting it.,neutral,5886
5887,"Distinguishing among interventions in terms of how much they contribute to resilience versus climate adaptation would be difficult if not unproductive, but field projects need some guidance of how the interventions are different and what the best practices are to develop effective climate adaptation interventions in specific contexts.",neutral,5887

5892,"Based on the information collected from stakeholders, the evaluation team feels that it is not realistic for the Somali government to take over the data analysis and database management, due to limited technical and institutional capacity.",neutral,5892
5893,"There is, however, a need for further capacity development to gradually increase government involvement (e.g. in the data analysis), and to gradually transfer other parts of the project operation to Somalia, even if this will remain under remote management from Nairobi.",neutral,5893
5894,"The three levels of capacity development (capacity development of individuals, organizations and in the enabling environment) were identified as central to the development process.",neutral,5894

5945,"Before December 2013, FAOSS had a close working relationship with government and had invested heavily in developing the capacity of the nascent administration, both nationally and at state levels.",neutral,5945
5946,"The events of December 2013 triggered a dramatic change in context as donors withdrew their support for capacity development of central government, and the capacity of government ministries declined, accelerated by the economic crisis.",neutral,5946
5947,The revised CPF sets out a clear strategic direction for FAOSS to 2017 and has been developed collaboratively with government.,neutral,5947
5948,"The CPF could be strengthened with greater attention to preparedness, building flexibility into programming appropriate to the volatile context of South Sudan, and ensuring emergency programming is more informed by the resilience paradigm.",neutral,5948
5949,"The new resilience strategy, being drafted at the time of writing, is an opportunity to spell out more complex interventions appropriate in a protracted crisis, to complement the ELRP.",neutral,5949
5950,FAO is also a member of the Cash Transfer and Market Working Group.,neutral,5950
5951,"It is participating in some major activities but could be more influential, for example sharing its innovative approach to ITFs, an approach that could and has been used in other countries for food and non-food items.",neutral,5951
5952,"The fishery in South Sudan is open access, with no controls on numbers of fishers or entry.",neutral,5952
5953,"It would therefore be prudent to calculate the overall annual catch from the emergency kits, in view of the paucity of data on fishery resources in the country.",neutral,5953
5954,Some IPs have more experience and a stronger track-record in AAP than FAOSS.,neutral,5954

5957,"It is still at an early stage of working this through to programme design and implementation, which will require rethinking its approach to the provision of animal health services to consider cost- recovery in all but the worst conflict-affected states.",neutral,5957
5958,Resilience thinking is more evident in the 2016 ELRP.,neutral,5958
5959,"Key leadership skills required for South Sudan include diplomacy and relationship- building, analytical skills, advocacy and communication, strong operational management skills, underpinned by shrewd political acumen.",neutral,5959
5960,This range of skills may be best provided by a leadership team rather than expected to come from one individual.,neutral,5960
5961,"As the food security situation deteriorates in parts of the country, FAOSS should develop an advocacy strategy and ramp up its advocacy and communication skills at all levels.",neutral,5961
5962,This is fundamentally a contractual relationship of service provision rather than a genuine partnership.,neutral,5962
5963,"FAOSS should now identify which of its IPs it wants to develop a more strategic partnership with, to reflect a more equal relationship, drawing on the knowledge and comparative advantage of each organization.",neutral,5963
5964,Two years into the conflict is a good time to take stock.,neutral,5964
5965,It is also time to inject a more analytical and differentiated approach to programming that is better nuanced to the particular context of different states and different livelihood groups.,neutral,5965
5966,The evaluation encourages greater differentiation between the most conflict-affected states and the less conflict-affected states where more developmental approaches can be applied.,neutral,5966

5992,"With partners, the project developed a comprehensive EAFM training package and delivered 13 EAFM training events, to 418 participants in five countries.",neutral,5992
5993,"The structuring of the activities in that component, according to the evaluation team, should be fostered through the selection and hiring of professionals specialized in the fields of communications and environmental education.",neutral,5993

6030,"For many, it is a key that enables them to access the labour market, escape from poverty and gives them the opportunity to adapt to a changing world.",neutral,6030
6031,Skills development is a fundamental enabler of decent work.,neutral,6031
6032,"For example, work in national training system reform is hard to compare with projects that build skills to improve livelihoods in rural communities.",neutral,6032

6102,"On the second area, the report notes the increasing interest in diasporas considered as agents of development through remittances and investments in countries of origin.",neutral,6102
6103,"An effective implementation of programmes in that area also requires an appropriate assessment of the diasporas, of their capacity to invest, and of the investment climate and opportunities in the country of origin.",neutral,6103
6104,"Concerning labour migration, the report suggests a continuing focus on the management of organized labour migration and to include a development component in activities when relevant, as is the case with the labour migration projects being implemented between Guatemala and Canada.",neutral,6104
6105,But labour migration does not systematically require a strong link with development prospects; as the recently adopted strategy document says: The primary goal of IOM is to facilitate the orderly and humane management of international migration.,neutral,6105
6106,The fourth area includes capacity building projects and researches where IOM has gained a recognized expertise.,neutral,6106
6107,A new area that deserves special attention within MIDA is the active promotion of the inclusion of migration into the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers of developing countries.,neutral,6107

6148,"Conscious that UNEP planning processes are already perceived as rather cumbersome and time-consuming, the proposed recommendations do not add additional requirements, procedures or processes but aim to strengthen those already in place.",neutral,6148
6149,"There are generally fewer recommendations for the higher level planning processes and documents (MTS and PoWs), whilst more opportunities for improvement have been identified at the Programme Framework and Project Document level.",neutral,6149
6150,It is at these latter levels that the greatest potential for improvement coincides with the highest likelihood of translation into improved UNEP strategic focus and operational performance.,neutral,6150
6151,Human and financial resource needs estimates are presented in the PoWs for all elements of the work plan.,neutral,6151

6167,"C&W. The success of the Sub- programme in supporting countries to reach the desired transition to sound management of C&W (the intermediate state towards impact) depended, to a very large degree, on the extent to which the various dimensions of national capacity have been developed coupled with the presence of drivers and validity of assumptions made during sub-programme design.",neutral,6167
6168,"As is the case in most of UNEP‘s activities, the degree to which the stated direct outcomes can be achieved in the targeted countries with the associated changes in state, corporate and individual behaviours determines how progress is being made towards impact.",neutral,6168

6191,An inception phase for activities such as hiring staff and negotiating partner agreements should be considered for larger or more complex (multi-partner) projects.,neutral,6191
6192,"Many of the EMSP projects are complex combining normative work (such as technical guidelines and policy work) with field interventions (pilot or demonstration projects), operate at multiple geographical scales (e.g. local, national and regional), and/or involve large multi-stakeholder or intergovernmental processes.",neutral,6192

6235,"Since then, UNHCR has promulgated a very different policy document on urban refugees.",neutral,6235
6236,"The new policy is a marked reversal of the 1997 policy, a document that focused more on reducing assistance and security issues for urban refugees and less on protection.",neutral,6236
6237,A return to New Delhi was especially interesting since the author of the new policy had been on the earlier evaluation team and noted that the earlier mission seeded many elements of the new policy.,neutral,6237
6238,Two-thirds of the 2000 evaluation made explicit suggestions for amending the 1997 policy and laid considerable groundwork for the 2009 policy.,neutral,6238
6239,"Thus, a return to New Delhi in January 2013 to evaluate the viability of the new, more progressive policy toward urban refugees and the applicability of the twelve protection strategies was perhaps an overdue analysis.",neutral,6239

6243,"In response to the juxtaposition of an economic boom and a persistently high poverty rate, India has spent billions of dollars on poverty alleviation schemes in the past decade.",neutral,6243
6244,"Even though many Indians continue to be mired in poverty, the government provides access to health, education and potentially to selected poverty alleviation schemes to refugees.",neutral,6244
6245,This is all the more significant since India is neither a signatory to the 1951 Convention nor does it have a national refugee law.,neutral,6245
6246,"Moreover, India has recently agreed to allow mandate refugees to apply for long-term visas that would provide them with the legal right to work and access to all academic institutions.",neutral,6246
6247,"Even so, many of the refugees in New Delhi would like to move on to a third country and recently the UNHCR Office has spent considerable resources in discouraging unrealistic aspirations for resettlement.",neutral,6247

6249,"And at this destination, refugees need to navigate how to live amongst the multitudes of the indigenous poor.",neutral,6249
6250,"For the most part, refugees are only accessing entry-level jobs and they are competing with Indian nationals for them.",neutral,6250

6255,African refugees are the target of racist attacks.,neutral,6255
6256,"In trying to avail themselves of services, refugees have learned they must navigate a slow paced bureaucracy.",neutral,6256
6257,This is of particular concern in the face of the promises of the long stay visas.,neutral,6257

6261,"With the work opportunities this visa affords in an up and coming city, it can open doors to a better socio- economic status.",neutral,6261

6266,Most of the family reunification opportunities would be in Europe.,neutral,6266
6267,"Thus, the UNHCR Office has a two-fold challenge in implementing the new policy for refugees in urban areas: 1) shifting the mindset of refugees from leaving India to staying and exploiting the opportunities offered, and, 2) advocating with the Government of India to make the lives of refugees tenable by actualizing their promises of widely recognized documents that would enable refugees to compete for more than slum-based opportunities.",neutral,6267

6301,"Although funding may provide general leverage, its use as a tool for encouraging concrete improvements in RSD appears to be difficult and limited.",neutral,6301

6303,The report recommends (11) that UNHCR considers establishing benchmarks for protection staffing in situations of transition.,neutral,6303
6304,They could serve as a useful complement to those formulated in 2010 for mandate RSD operations.,neutral,6304
6305,"In addition, it is proposed (vi) to complement the findings with a more strategic inquiry into recent alternative, protection sensitive strategies which have helped to relieve pressures on individual RSD systems.",neutral,6305
6306,"In order to put RSD transition policy and practice in a broader perspective, it is finally recommended (vii) to review the functioning and resourcing of mandate RSD in selected countries that are engaged in RSD transition.",neutral,6306
6307,"In the proposed methodology, it is foreseen to pay attention to the views of asylum-seekers and refugees and to make good use of the expertise of experts from governments and NGO partners.",neutral,6307
6308,"Somalis comprised the largest nationality group among asylum-seekers and refugees, at some 427,311.",neutral,6308
6309,"Of the total number of refugees and asylum-seekers in 2014, 34,011 were asylum-seekers with pending claims, while 551,352 were refugees.",neutral,6309

6311,"The number of pending claims in Kakuma remains substantial, and will require concerted efforts to address it and ensure that decision-making can continue to keep pace with new claims.",neutral,6311
6312,"In other locations, claim numbers of the current order in the other locations are likely to be manageable only if decision-making rates increase progressively beyond those seen in the first six months of the transition process, from July to December 2014, and planned measures are implemented to use simplified processing and other streamlined approaches to claims where appropriate, as well as improving efficiency in regular RSD.",neutral,6312
6313,"The efficacy of decision-making will need to be monitored continuously, and the capacity of the system to manage its caseload may come into question if claims were to increase substantially, current and planned streamlining and efficiency measures cannot be implemented, or significant further backlogs were to build up.",neutral,6313

6324,"While these provisions were annulled by a High Court judgment in early 2015, they demonstrate the level of political sensitivity around the presence of urban refugees, and around refugee issues in Kenya more broadly.",neutral,6324
6325,"In order to achieve an efficient and sustainable national RSD system, as part of an effective refugee protection framework in Kenya more broadly, it is imperative that the political will on the part of the authorities to take charge of registration and refugee status determination is translated into a commitment to allocate sufficient and sustained resources (both human and financial) in the coming years.",neutral,6325
6326,"Other essential steps include establishment of the relevant institutions and civil service posts, and allocation of national resources to the process.",neutral,6326
6327,"As Kenya continues to be exposed to the serious threat of terrorist acts, there is an evident interest for the country in enhancing oversight and control over who legally resides on Kenyan soil.",neutral,6327
6328,"However, there is also a risk of excessive politicisation of refugee issues in Kenya, which could undermine the RSD process and pose risks for the institution of international protection more broadly, as political rhetoric aimed at forcing Somali refugees to return to their country has increased in volume and intensity.",neutral,6328
6329,"The establishment and ongoing operation of a well-functioning RSD process needs to be clearly separated from political discussions and purely based on legal, technical and practical considerations.",neutral,6329
6330,"Any political pressure disproportionately to curtail the rights of refugees, contrary to national and international law, should be resisted in favour of measured responses that respect the rule of law.",neutral,6330
6331,"To be efficient in this context, UNHCR first needs to increase its education staff in-country, both in Ankara and in the field offices.",neutral,6331

6348,The refugees are to be found primarily in remote and impoverished areas of Bangladesh which have not benefited from the modest economic growth that has recently taken place in some other parts of the country.,neutral,6348
6349,Bangladesh also considers there has been inadequate international understanding and support with respect to the refugee impact on host communities.,neutral,6349
6350,"The presence and general tolerance of such large numbers of Rohingya in Bangladesh derives in part from the social, ethnic, linguistic and religious characteristics that they share with the host community, particularly their common adherence to Islam.",neutral,6350

6356,The absence of any durable solution adds to the frustration of the refugees and the demoralization of the humanitarian personnel who work on their behalf.,neutral,6356
6357,"First, as the three traditional durable solutions appear so elusive, alternative approaches should be considered.",neutral,6357
6358,"More specifically, there may be scope to advocate on behalf of a framework which provides refugees with a formal status that would allow them access to employment opportunities and government services.",neutral,6358
6359,"The fact that Bangladesh is itself highly dependent on income from migrant labour, and has recently signed the International Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers, is relevant in this respect.",neutral,6359
6360,"Third, it should be recalled that the Rohingya refugee situation is now a truly regional one, affecting not only Bangladesh but also countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia as well as India and the Middle East.",neutral,6360
6361,"This argues very strongly in favour of an Asia-Pacific approach to the issue, involving not only those states that are hosting refugees, but also countries such as China and India that have considerable influence throughout the region, as well as resettlement countries outside the region.",neutral,6361

6370,But how and when do we measure this effectiveness?,neutral,6370
6371,"A 2001 UNHCR paper pointed out that many evaluations tended to take place while UNHCR still had a significant presence in the country, rather than after its phase-out, thus, the organization was unable to assess the longer-term consequences of its interventions.",neutral,6371

6386,That question had never been asked.,neutral,6386
6387,It turned out that approximately a third of the population originated from other parts of Mozambique but had chosen to relocate to this community because of its good land and favourable location.,neutral,6387
6388,The village leaders confirmed that there was land available because of the high death toll and due to out migration.,neutral,6388

6492,"The SOPs, in their present draft form, are intended to more expeditiously assure that the protection needs of those affected by a natural disaster are taken care of.",neutral,6492
6493,The SOPs provide a range of options for the Cluster Leadership role.,neutral,6493
6494,"Although they are oriented to UNHCR assuming such a role in specific circumstances, they do not lock UNHCR into this role.",neutral,6494
6495,Their merit lies in designating the Lead Agency in a more prompt manner than is currently the case.,neutral,6495
6496,"Today, UNHCR is engaged in some twenty IDP operations related to conflict situations as Lead of the Protection Cluster and in eight of these it exercises the Lead Role for Emergency Shelter and in five a similar role for Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM).",neutral,6496
6497,"Given the systemic linkages between UNDAC disaster assessments, CERF Rapid Response Grants and Flash Appeals, UNHCR should give serious consideration to becoming an integral member of UNDAC teams, along with OCHA, UNDP, UNICEF, WFP and WHO.",neutral,6497
6498,"To ensure a holistic response by the international community in a natural disaster, it is important that there be a protection component in UNDAC assessments.",neutral,6498
6499,The issue is also raised in the recent IASC-sponsored Cluster Approach Evaluation Phase 2.,neutral,6499
6500,"Most importantly, there should be a shared appreciation of the need for a broad, comprehensive, but operationally-oriented concept of protection by the three key potential Cluster Leads, so as to ensure coherence of approach should any of the three agencies be called upon to assume the Cluster Lead role in the Field.",neutral,6500
6501,The first relates to an intervention by UNHCR limited to the provision of Non-Food Items (NFIs).,neutral,6501
6502,Here the concrete case of the Philippines Hurricanes was studied (2009).,neutral,6502
6503,This choice of the Philippines was also dictated by the fact that UNHCR saw this as a prototype of future such interventions in natural disasters.,neutral,6503
6504,"The fourth and fifth scenarios looked at the concrete interventions in Myanmar (2008) and Haiti (2010) as examples of a more general involvement in natural disasters, either with responsibility for particular Clusters (Myanmar) or without having a lead role in relation to any sector (Haiti).",neutral,6504
6505,"This latter operation was chosen as the UN response has been somewhat criticized and, on the basis of the UN performance to date in the Protection Cluster, some have called for UNHCR to be the lead agency in any future natural disaster involving significant displacement.",neutral,6505
6506,Related to the costs of intervention is the question of the duration of a given operation.,neutral,6506
6507,"The work of the PCWG at the country-level, like that of all clusters, should be time-limited on the basis of the preliminary needs assessment.",neutral,6507
6508,"The work of the Cluster needs to be seen in the context of the ongoing work of the UN Country Team (UNCT) and various coordinating frameworks, such as United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), and be focused on protection issues arising from the natural disaster and not long-standing ones aggravated by the natural disaster; the latter are important but should be the focus of the ongoing work programme of the relevant UN members of the UNCT.",neutral,6508
6509,"The IASC needs to establish guidelines for the winding up of clusters, and for ensuring that Strategic Operational Frameworks for each Cluster in a given operation include an exit strategy.",neutral,6509
6510,"Otherwise, one will be confronted with open-ended engagements similar to protracted refugee situations.",neutral,6510
6511,"Partnerships are essential for effective protection delivery, be it in refugee or IDP situations.",neutral,6511
6512,"The key partner is the State with which rests the primary responsibility for protection, especially in IDP situations.",neutral,6512
6513,Cluster interventions when called for by a State should primarily be about enhancing support to national structures.,neutral,6513
6514,This is why the Protection Cluster might better be described as the Protection Support Cluster.,neutral,6514
6515,"Often, many of the issues identified by the Protection Cluster are such that they need an input by a range of clusters which only the HC can assure.",neutral,6515
6516,"Furthermore, there needs to be close cooperation between all the Clusters in a given operation, especially between the Shelter, CCCM and Education Clusters.",neutral,6516
6517,"In regard to the last mentioned cluster, evacuation centres are invariably set up in schools.",neutral,6517
6518,The return to normal life as expressed in schooling is often complicated by the use of school facilities for emergency accommodation.,neutral,6518
6519,"Above all, the leadership of the various clusters needs to be in the hands of experienced agency staff, and the rules for the functioning of the various clusters, especially the determination of who may participate in their work, should be looked into.",neutral,6519
6520,It is in this perspective that UNHCR should seek to become part of the UNDAC.,neutral,6520
6521,"It should also seek to ensure that through the IASC, issues related to profiling of IDPs become the recognized responsibility of Protection Cluster Working Group (PCWG).",neutral,6521
6522,It is suggested that any further involvement in this new type of IDP operations by UNHCR should take place in an incremental manner with an involvement in 2010 limited initially to a specified number of natural disasters.,neutral,6522
6523,Nor does it jeopardize the need for greater clarity and speed in designating the Lead Agency of the Protection Cluster at the country level.,neutral,6523
6524,"The High Commissioner, in the light of the likely significant demands flowing from any UNHCR involvement in natural disasters, may need to review the staffing implications of such involvement; as a minimum, two parts of UNHCR Headquarters will require strengthening, namely the Emergency Preparedness and Response Section (EPRS), and the second pillar in the revised DIP structure which will be dealing with the Protection Cluster.",neutral,6524
6525,It is suggested that each of these be strengthened by the creation of two posts at the P-4 level.,neutral,6525
6526,The context within which the project operated changed significantly in the course of 2009.,neutral,6526
6527,"Early in the year, there was a shift away from the model of rapid onward transfer, and at the time of the evaluation mission, a new government policy of enhanced cooperation with the Libyan authorities on preventing irregular departures, together with the interception of boats outside Italian territorial waters and the return of those on board to Libya, had resulted in a sharp drop in the number of arrivals in Sicily and Lampedusa.",neutral,6527
6528,"This study has found that PoC face high levels of shocks and stressors, inhibiting their livelihood development and progress toward self-reliance.",neutral,6528

6533,UNHCR has an important role to play as a convener of the livelihoods sector coordination as it relates to refugees.,neutral,6533
6534,It is critical that UNHCR is at the table in conversations that involve the humanitarian-development nexus and refugee contexts because UNHCR knows refugees.,neutral,6534
6535,UNHCR should be part of the conversation not only about refugee protection but also about refugee livelihoods and economic inclusion.,neutral,6535

6539,"For UNHCR, the issue of involving development actors in the search for durable solutions for persons displaced by conflict, namely refugees, has a long history stretching back to the early 1980s, in particular the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa (ICARA) in 1984.",neutral,6539
6540,"More recently, especially after the UN Humanitarian Response Review of 2005, internally displaced persons have also become a regular, though distinct, feature of the search for durable solution.",neutral,6540
