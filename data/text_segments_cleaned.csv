Decision-making processes are ill-defined and poorly understood. Formalized and streamlined procedures would also have the potential to reduce transaction costs and potentially attract additional donor funding.,negative

While many decision-making processes remain centralized and lengthier than they should be, the ‘Level 3’ protocols and the introduction of new partnership tools such as OPIM are a sign that operational difficulties are being taken seriously and progressively addressed.",negative
"This is because as FAO expanded its portfolio in emergency and rehabilitation activities, the Organization used humanitarian resource channels that are relatively easier to access than development funding.",negative
"his funding model continued to some extent with Strategic Programme 5 as well, in that the Strategic Programme has benefited from very limited Regular Programme resources. As a result, the implementation of the SO5 vision and philosophy, as described in the FAO Strategic Framework, relies largely on external, short-term funding over which FAO has little control",negative

FAO lacks a formal programme level connecting the projects and the country programming frameworks, hence the recourse to country resilience strategies.",negative
"Many technical units engage in resilience-related policies in a scattered manner. The different tools and systems developed by FAO for early warning and food security information are still managed in a disperse manner without much integration and synergies between them.

FAO could strengthen its strategic position by deepening its involvement in resilience.,negative
"While silos were broken within Strategic Programme 5, there is potential for more collaboration between Strategic Programmes at headquarters.",negative
FAO has yet to make its presence fully felt in the “resilience space”. Seizing the opportunity presented by the current interest in resilience requires continued and strengthened operational and technical capacity together with increased investment in resilience programming.,negative
"Conclusion 5: Resilience programming is not fundamentally new to FAO. The evolution towards development-oriented crisis surveillance, preparedness and response started before SO5. A number of so-called “signature resilience services”, anchored in decade-long FAO experience, were identified as having potential for upscaling.",negative
"Conclusion 6: Insufficient attention has been paid to knowledge management so far. A reform of the type undertaken by FAO needs a strong knowledge sharing effort and infrastructure. This is especially important for SO5, which encapsulates a programmatic shift towards resilience.",negative

All together the results of the component are considered moderately unsatisfactory.,negative
"The activities related to the strengthening of the Bocaina Mosaic, including the establishment of a permanent executive structure, were largely based on a misconception at the time the project was conceived. This was the failure to recognize the essence of the Mosaic concept, which is consultative, rather than executive. Eventually due to the nature of the Mosaic, the many stakeholders involved, political interests and other issues, more conflicts arose and by 2016 the Bocaina Mosaic activities came to a standstill. Since Component 2 of the project leaned considerably on the Mosaic to obtain its results, some of the project’s intended outcomes were jeopardized and did not materialize.",negative
"BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) values have not been reduced. It was foreseen that the considerable investments in sanitation by the municipalities of Angra dos Reis and Paraty would include sewage water treatment, expectation that did not materialize. This can be attributed to the fact that during formulation, the contribution of the municipalities was not made sufficiently specific. As a result, the municipalities set priorities within the scope of sanitation, but which did not contribute to the achievement of project objectives.",negative
The main flaws to be considered are the lack of a thorough previous stakeholder analysis and the lack of consideration of gender issues.,negative
"However, at project conception it was wrongly considered that the mosaic was to have an executive character, where in reality it is merely consultative. Ultimately, activities related to the mosaic came to a standstill and were eventually abandoned.",negative

"Despite the gender issues inherent in most projects, for example, no gender analysis was conducted. The discussions with stakeholders at all levels revealed a significant gap in capacities, attitudes and knowledge regarding gender equality, as well as how this issue could be addressed.",negative
"The evaluation observed several discrepancies between the programme’s reported results and the actual results in the field. The outputs could be significantly improved, particularly through a greater focus on the needs of beneficiaries.",negative
"The outputs could have had a greater impact by building on existing projects, or by being continued and expanded by partner organizations.",negative

"In particular, the bureaucracy involved contributed to serious delays in the implementation of the programme.",negative
"Most of the scattered and small projects were unable to achieve impact in isolation, as the challenges they addressed were often interdependent. Moreover, these projects did not collaborate with larger programmes on related issues. As a result, some of the achievements (e.g. strategic plans and policies developed) were isolated and disconnected from the programme as a whole.",negative
"This was especially the case for field-oriented programmes, such as cattle production, watershed management and home-based nurseries, where the activities were developed around community organizations. Moreover, it was noted that the selection and training process for workshops must ensure that participants will utilise the knowledge provided, and that the target group is well defined to suit the content.",negative
The operational and financial framework was not very successful in establishing an effective field programme.,negative
"In another example, although the concepts of environmental sustainability were built into the design of several projects, they were not integrated into the project activities.",negative

"In a number of cases, a lack of institutional development limited the potential of technical interventions.",negative
The recent (2018‒2019) evaluations of FAO’s contributions to gender equality and nutrition point to insufficient operationalization of the FAO Gender and Nutrition Policies through the Strategic Framework.,negative

"A strong case exists for sharpening climate-change outputs and indicators in the results chains of specific SOs and in the main sectors – crops, fisheries, livestock and forestry – to improve visibility of the work across SOs, to make resource mobilization more effective and to avail of climate financing.",negative
"This will require greater attention to the scale and impact of investment operations than merely stepping up resource mobilization for programme delivery. With the private sector playing a significant role in financing the 2030 development agenda, FAO will also need to step up its private-sector engagement.",negative

"The main shortcoming affecting the relevance of the projects evaluated was the decision to fund a large number of projects through two different funding windows at the same time. This contributed to atomized funding, increased the risk of overlaps and affected the possibility of building mutually reinforcing synergies.",negative
"Furthermore, the vast majority of immediate action projects did not monitor the adaptability and productivity performance of PGRFA. This represents a major shortcoming of the immediate action projects considering the high productivity rates of local varieties of beans, maize, millet, potato and sorghum, which could have been of great interest to other immediate action projects (especially in the same regions), and decision makers in building awareness at national level on the importance of PGRFA for sustainable livelihoods and climate change adaptation.",negative

Immediate action projects have experienced difficulties in securing adequate funds since project closure. This has resulted in a large number of farmers discontinuing the use of PGRFA distributed.",negative
"However, the formulation of a large number of strategic action plans without clear funding sources identified before project closure is not considered good value for money.

"However, taking into consideration the significant budget cuts in the country since 2016, it is probable that the level of replicability will be low in the next few years due to its high cost. Regarding the replicability of economic activities, the evaluation was not able to determine their level of profitability at this time as they are still being performed. In the majority of cases observed (handicrafts, dyeing of wool, etc.), the indications are that the beneficiaries still require training on topics such as quality control and the sale and marketing of their products and services",negative
"In particular, the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources was mainly focused on the harvesting of water resources in the upper paramo basins and sub-basins and the optimization of their use, the application of a pilot model of compensation mechanisms for the Payment for Environmental Services (PSA). In contrast, the conservation of biodiversity and agrobiodiversity in the paramos was much less evident, partly because there was not enough awareness and recognition of their use and function. Consequently, for example, it was observed that adaptation to climate change using local resistant crops in order to consolidate the food sovereignty and security of the communities involved in accordance with project objectives and the current legal framework (particularly the Law on Agrobiodiversity and Seeds) was not promoted.",negative
"This situation is partly due to the lack of a final objective, the need to perform a high number of activities and works in the last semester of the Project and the lack of a role of responsibilities agreed upon between the OPIM/GADPCH and FAO since the start of the Project. FAO's role in guiding and monitoring the planning and operations of the OPIM and the GADPCH was weak, particularly where there were gaps in the execution, such as in the conservation of biodiversity/agrobiodiversity, the development of economic activities, the establishment of a system to monitor biotic resources and the lack of recognition of the competencies of the RPFCH authorities in directly executing the new RPFCH management plan.",negative

"However, the execution of some outputs completed in the last months of the Project could experience sustainability difficulties as a result of not having a formal subsequent transfer of technical monitoring, and taking into consideration that the Project did not establish some activities to support the conservation and the proper management of the paramo, such as, for example, a system to monitor the outcomes and tangible changes at an environmental, social and economic level.",negative
"However, it was necessary to extend the duration of the project by about two years and 20 percent of the GEF funds were executed in the last six months.",negative
"n addition, some obstacles were found that did not permit ongoing institutional strengthening in the province or of the Ministry of Environment with regard to Component 2. In particular, the high staff turnover in the OPIM, the GADPCH and the cantonal and parish DAGs, the lack of clarification of the responsibilities of the OPIM and of FAO-Ecuador (particularly at the beginning of the Project, after the change in OPIM staff in 2013 and after the Mid-term Evaluation at the end of 2015) and the lack of monitoring of the outcomes and risk management by the OPIM technical team to mitigate the problems associated with the slow execution of the Project in time.",negative

"mproved monitoring and communication of FAO’s results and what it can offer, and a strengthened role as a neutral knowledge broker could serve to amplify its comparative advantage as a provider of technical expertise. FAO therefore needs to more loudly share lessons from pilot projects and from its experience and expertise. This requires a centralized monitoring and evaluation function, better knowledge management and outreach to make sure the lessons learned from TCPs and pilots are integrated into larger donor-funded projects, even if they will not be implemented by FAO.

"However, the evaluation noted that other mangrove consultation frameworks already existed (for instance the Cameroon Mangrove Network) and the project could have focused on strengthening these networks. Issues about sustainability arose because these platforms do not have the financial resources to operate. Furthermore, the project did not provide for actions to monitor the implementation of their action plans.",negative
The project has not yet put in place a strategy to use the results of permanent plot monitoring after its closure.,negative
"onsequently, at the time of the evaluation, no protected area covered by the project had obtained legal status. Furthermore, the evaluation of protected area management effectiveness, which is a requirement of this project and of GEF projects in general, has not been carried out.",negative
"Indeed, the results and effects obtained appear to be lower than expected.",negative
"However, the studies carried out by the project did not always highlight gender specificities. Finally, at community level, women have been involved to a limited extent, particularly in communal forest inventories and in the executive office of the Manoka Community Forest legal entity.",negative
"The report repeatedly highlighted the weak involvement of the private sector as a major issue, which is nevertheless a key actor as a user and potential polluter of mangrove ecosystems.",negative
"However, the design was not well balanced to ensure the adoption of a multisectoral approach in all JRP villages and throughout the duration of the project: the WASH component covered a limited number of villages in a single locality. A dramatic increase in the number of villages to correct an initial wrong estimate of the population catchment led to a postponement of food security and livelihood activities in about half the targeted villages. This reduced the integrated dimension of JRP and compromised the quality of some interventions.",negative
"However, absence of a common database managed by a fully dedicated JRP M&E officer limited the project’s capacity to manage and process data. The JRP’s M&E system did not provide a full picture of what was implemented in specific villages or localities, though this would have been interesting to monitor the effectiveness of activities’ integration. Moreover, some Output 4 and 5 activities were monitored as a package through aggregated indicators that could not provide quantifiable evidence of what exactly was implemented. Results and effects of activities that just started at the end of 2016 could not be measured through the last follow-up survey in 2016. These are weak points of the M&E system that constrained the assessment of the scope and effects of the intervention.",negative
"he consultation phase was longer than planned as the number of villages to consult had doubled, though little time was dedicated to each village. Feedback to the community and project documentation adjustments to the CAPs were not clearly included in the design.",negative
"The revision of the CAP by technical experts reduced potential ownership and buy-in of the process by the communities. The revised CAP did not present all the communities’ priorities, nor did it include quantified targets to be achieved by the project. However, targets had been discussed at the initial stage, so the CAP created expectations which could in turn generate frustration if targets were laterconsidered not to have been achieved by communities. This provides lessons on the involvement of communities in the design of future community-based resilience intervention (see Recommendation 3).",negative
"While this could have been an opportunity to strengthen the capacities of ministries to work together and develop multisectoral strategies, JRP did not make the most of it. As far as possible, multisectoral programme should address the issue of national institutional mechanisms to implement a multisectoral approach.",negative
"t would have been useful to register this indicator in all JRP communities measuring their initial perception of their ability to cope with climatic shocks from the beginning, in 2014, and collecting such a qualitative indicator annually. This would have enabled proper feedback from communities on activities carried out during the year and ensured the update of action plans.",negative
A reduction of the period dedicated to the implementation of Output 2 to Output 4 activities has had an impact on overall achievements.,negative
"he shorter time frame can be explained by internal factors: increase in the number of villages, the longer period dedicated to CAP formulation; underrating of the time needed to adapt project tools following the community consultation. External factors were at play too, including the occurrence of drought and floods in 2016 and the JRP response to these which reduced the teams’ capacity to implement and monitor the regular JRP programme. A better assessment of the context, to include a realistic number of targeted villages from the outset and the inclusion of a pre-established mechanisms to answer climatic shocks in the design, would have eased the management of the JRP management and respect of the timeframe.",negative
Waiting for a CAP to be validated to start their implementation was superfluous and only delayed the beginning of the activities.,negative
"This is due to a lack of investment, with only 5 percent of the programme budget for WASH, and impact of floods, but also due to difficult coordination with the AquaForEast project. Differences in programmes’ approach and time constraints are challenges to be taken into consideration",negative
"when attempting to create synergies and efficiency between programmes. Moreover, while coordination within the JRP was already an issue, it can be considered overambitious to ask the programme to coordinate with an external project.",negative
"WASH components raised an issue of sustainability, considering there was no effective water management committee, no fees were systematically collected for most water sources and locality services were weak. A clear strategy to ensure some sustainability, relying on investment of the communities and included in the CAP should have been defined at design stage. Moreover, adequate human resources should be allocated to mobilize communities which are not inclined to pay for water.",negative
"However, most of these effects would have to be assessed at a later stage, also considering that annual surveys did not show clear overall improvement of livelihoods at this stage.",negative
he JRP team had to manage a wide range of activities with limited time and human resources. Field teams could not ensure monitoring and follow-up of activities to consolidate the achievements of the programme and this represents a risk for the quality of interventions as well as for their sustainability.,negative
but impacts of the 2015-2016 drought and flood episodes still limited the overall achievements of JRP.,negative
"Better preparedness and anticipation would have helped to better respond to needs, and in particular to provide early assistance for livestock owners affected by drought.",negative
"The choice of villages should have been documented in detail to clarify the various criteria used to select villages, the decision-making process and the roles of different actors involved. There was also a lack of clarity regarding the way project resources were shared between the 75 villages. The selection of beneficiaries was left to the to the VDCs who have their own perception of equity, in practice often centred exclusively on balancing support to different tribal components of the community. Though this may be a rational choice, it does not reflect the initial JRP criteria. An obvious concentration of benefits towards certain individuals who did not necessarily belong to the most vulnerable segments of the population appeared as a risk, besides countering the stated JRP goal of reducing vulnerability. Complaint mechanisms, absent in the JRP, are vital to alert when project benefits are captured by non-eligible beneficiaries and to point out those eligible/intended beneficiaries who did not receive such benefits. This would have been particularly relevant for the JRP seeing that the time to follow-up the targeting was limited as a consequence of the large number of activities and the doubling of the number of villages",negative
"The full implications of coordinated planning and implementation between agencies were not fully considered, and this ultimately hampered achievement of the full potential of joint programming.",negative
The predefined orientation of the JRP based on extrinsic considerations did not allow to fully consider communities’ priorities. Transparency and clear feedback mechanisms with communities were also lacking when they would have been crucial to a project hinged on consultation with beneficiaries and their participation.,negative

The short duration and small size of FAO’s programme were considered as a constraint to sustained and sizable results.

With regard to achieving the outcomes of the third specific objective - to educate and raise awareness among decision-makers, teachers, students and consumers about the environmental, nutritional, cultural and economic value of agrobiodiversity - the project was less successful.

"his situation contributed to a delay in the implementation of activities, particularly under component 2, of around 10 months. In particular, it can be observed that INIAP did not manage to pledge all of the cofinancing intended, particularly since 2016 due to budget restrictions and political changes that reduced its role in agricultural extension, particularly with regard to the transfer of technology. It was also difficult to sign the LoA with the Heifer Foundation that, on the one hand, could not take on the role of service provider without prior training by FAO-EC and, on the other hand, continued in the Steering Committee subsequent to the decision to apply the DIM by FAO-EC which, in effect, resulted in the Foundation playing the role of both judge and defendant when it came to decision-making. In addition, the internal monitoring system and the management of risks did not contribute to improving the efficiency of planning and implementation. On the one hand, the monitoring and management of risks were focused on pursuing targets to fulfil the bureaucratic needs of the GEF and FAO. On the other hand, the project did not establish sufficient coordination mechanisms to stimulate reflection on the outcomes, lessons learned and good practices to replicate.",negative

In addition, the project did not manage to establish a communication strategy to promote passing this regulation and, according to evidence available, no mechanism or budget has been established to update, strengthen and broaden the main communications at an intra and inter-provincial level. In fact the lack of communication at these levels, partly due to the lack of time and resources, has not triggered the catalytic effect of the project.",negative
"In addition, extensive institutional changes were made from the design to the start of operations that contributed to losing almost one year of work.

The full impacts of the different systems of customary land ownership on the project’s ability to secure land for protected areas has proved to have been underestimated by the designers, most notably for Fiji and Niue. Regarding sustainable financing, the project team found that more groundwork and preparation was needed in each country than had been appreciated during project design",negative

"owever, the call for proposals focused primarily on food security with insufficient emphasis on nutrition; also gender differentiated approach in project execution has not been sufficiently prioritized. The main shortcoming affecting the relevance of the projects evaluated was the decision to fund a large number of projects through two different funding windows at the same time. This contributed to atomized funding, increased the risk of overlaps and affected the possibility of building mutually reinforcing synergies.",negative
"However, the formulation of a large number of strategic action plans without clear funding sources identified before project closure is not considered good value for money.",negative
"Furthermore, some overlaps were identified among projects (in terms of the countries covered) and the strategic action plans were formulated without information and data flows from the immediate action projects. Furthermore, the vast majority of immediate action projects did not monitor the adaptability and productivity performance of PGRFA. This represents a major shortcoming of the immediate action projects considering the high productivity rates of local varieties of beans, maize, millet, potato and sorghum, which could have been of great interest to other immediate action projects (especially in the same regions), and decision makers in building awareness at national level on the importance of PGRFA for sustainable livelihoods and climate change adaptation.

This focus was possible in part due to NGO partner knowledge on the issues.",negative

"The agency has been less active, organized and strategic than it needs to be in utilizing potential opportunities for funding and developing common agendas with donors, member countries and development organizations.

"Vaccination of as many animals as possible, as widely as possible, risks leaving herds susceptible to disease if herd immunity levels remain low and drug supply is inadequate.

"he very high cost of FFS in South Sudan raises issues of ‘value for money’: the diffusion of knowledge to non-beneficiaries is thus an important issue to address. It is too early to judge the effectiveness of APFS for livestock activities, as implementation is still at an early stage.",negative
"With a few exceptions, there is little evidence of the roll-out of training FAO expected at beneficiary level. Recognising the importance of FAO’s contribution to developing technical capacity as well as broader organizational capacity, FAO should move to a more strategic approach to capacity development, which reaches well beyond Juba.",negative
"In this context the role of the private sector deserves attention, especially in states less affected by the conflict, despite the challenges. FAO must develop a policy on cost recovery, which could be the basis for future privatization, for example of veterinary services, drawing on the experience of ICRC, the other key actor in the livestock sector, and on OLS experience. More experienced IPs, some of whom had previously supported the privatisation of drug supply systems in South Sudan, recognise that free drugs undermine the remaining private sector drug suppliers.",negative
Consultation with affected people in needs assessments was more limited. Feedback through the PDM has influenced planning of the following year’s ELRP but has not resulted in any immediate remedial action. FAOSS currently does not have a functioning feedback mechanism to beneficiaries when concerns are raised.

Ways of more systematically collecting good practice and lesson learning in-country must be sought, as well as sharing knowledge and experience regionally.",negative

"Changes in FAO’s overall strategic priority setting were not always reflected in the CGRFA work programme, and the implementation of ongoing mandated GRFA activities was not always without competition for limited resources. The time may be opportune to look into FAO’s institutional architecture for GRFA work, and develop ideas for better integration and increasing synergies.",negative

Furthermore, FAO is expected to manage the reporting efforts, and to monitor implementation of the GPAs for AnGR, PGR and FGR (and for aquatic genetic resources and biodiversity in the future)",negative

Respondents indicated that they typically stopped selling their surplus production during these periods, as market prices were unfavourable.",negative

"aps most pointedly, both donors and FAO Somalia respondents perceive that FAO Somalia have lost their position as a leader in the resilience field, as their momentum for critical thinking and innovation has slowed following the departure of the previous FAOR.",negative
Many donors stated that intrinsically they saw the benefit to a programme approach (e.g. more cohesive nature of planning) but that it did not impact their direct relationship (funding or otherwise) with FAO.,negative
"Many respondents explained that FPMIS continues to be too cumbersome for the needs of the programme approach. Another reason for this may be that the team is now used to their parallel system and has no incentive to move to FPMIS. In any case, this indicates a continued inability of the country office to manage a programme approach solely through FPMIS.",negative
"However, this potential still needs to be translated into concrete results.",negative
"To date, this has yet to be proven. Each agency keeps working on its agency-specific programme, using their own funding and administration mechanisms.",negative
"While this may indeed build NGO capacities, the long-term impact and result is unclear. While FAO Somalia has put in place a new Risk Management Framework, which was developed to ensure higher levels of accountability and more rigorous checks and balances, there does not appear to be a consistent plan or criteria for working with implementing partners specifically for capacity development.",negative
The programme offers a long list of activities but these do not seem to contain novel implementation practices to take advantage of the transformative potential that the resilience agenda may have had.,negative

Questions can also be raised in relation to the sustainability of benefits of CFW interventions on community assets, although field assessments indicate much appreciation for the trainings offered on how to manage and maintain the infrastructure constructed or rehabilitated through CFW. Feeder roads, canals and water catchments, which are the focus of CFW projects in the areas under analysis, are assets that require continuous maintenance. With regard to the choice of transfer modality, no documentation was found outlining the rationale and decision making processes underpinning the choice made by FAO and WFP to implement CFW and FFW activities respectively. This appears to be a gap, since the decision to implement CFW and FFW should be premised on robust market-based evidence.",negative
"owever, very similar livestock support activities have been implemented by various actors (including FAO) in Somalia and elsewhere in the Horn of Africa region for decades.

"n Dolow, market access was much easier than in Baki, for instance, where long distances to markets and roads in bad conditions were indicated as key constraints to marketing activities. Also, seasonal WFP food distributions and their repercussions on grain prices, as indicated by a number of our community-level respondents, represented additional constraints on the ability of agricultural producers to obtain profitable prices at the market.",negative
"owever, there is no consensus regarding the rationale or corporate vision behind the shift, and there is no sense that the entire organizational structure or approach has changed. There has been no declared plan for the transition to the programme approach and this lack of clarity has left the transition in a holding pattern with some departments continuing to forge ahead and others reverting back to the project approach. There is no clarity on how the programme approach better serves beneficiaries and so far, some improvements to efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability are visible but remain limited",negative
"Many of the corporate tools required to implement under a programme approach do not exist yet. In Somalia the JRS tries to break down technical silos, but the organogram of the FAO Country Office is still structured around teams with technical speciality as opposed to programmatic outcomes. Some sectors remain territorial over projects, activities and funding, while others are clearly collaborating more.",negative
"but there is agreement that the resilience paradigm, as laid out in the strategy, has not yet been proven. The lack of a joint beneficiary database or other mechanism (e.g. joint planning feeding into programmes, and field level coordination among agencies) that allows for assurance that all households received the inputs from each agency makes it impossible for the claim to be proven. Since the development of the JRS, an increase in resilience-focused consortia combined with a change in leadership at all three agencies have coincided with decreased funding, causing additional challenges and potentially lowering the motivation of leadership and implementation teams in the JRS.",negative
"Engagement with Somali communities by management and Nairobi level staff is constrained by the security situation, and linking programme design decision-making to CCAP and seasonal calendars remains challenging. There also remains a lack of familiarity and trust in RIMA among some partners.

There is however no indication that donor coordination was impacted by the transition to the programme approach.,negative
"But to outsiders, donors most notably, there has always been an expectation that UN agencies are collaborating in the field to ensure that no duplications occur and all comparative advantages are taken. More than one donor mentioned the expectation that agencies will not only work together but show evidence of increased cost efficiency by doing so",negative
"However, the implications of these changing roles for the programme remain unclear.",negative

"n comparison, the 2015 SAP is limited as a basis for effective strategic action at either the national or regional level. While SAP development was highly consultative, participatory and reflected a consensus of the eight BOBLME countries, the SAP does not convincingly define a set of strategies by which the priority issues will be addressed. It also does not define how the countries will organize and implement their own national SAP, integrate BOBLME actions with national institutional and financing arrangements, or improve inter-sectoral or inter- departmental collaboration",negative
"he evaluation found that this was misguided and resulted in an overemphasis being placed on multilateral actions. It is evident that the majority of the identified issues are common to the BOBLME countries rather than strictly transboundary; they do not necessitate all the Bay of Bengal countries acting together to address them. A more effective approach for the project and the TDA-SAP would have been to identify the most practicable opportunities, in single locations and countries, for testing and demonstrating potential solutions.",negative

"No specific regional MPA action plan was prepared, and no separate BOBLME MPA project was developed.",negative
"The evaluation concluded that policy work should have been integrated with the work on management strategies (e.g. ICM, critical habitats, MPA, fisheries).

"onetheless, th PRODOC misses sound analysis of the institutional context where activities were to be developed. In addition, the logical frame indicators refer to the general objective and, as such, are to a great extent beyond the project control, and the project contribution to the objective is not measured.

"However, CIPs were uneven in clarifying the extent to which these issues would be addressed through improved planning, advocacy and monitoring.",negative
"The evaluation found relatively strong evidence that multi-sector and multi- stakeholder approaches have brought about increased awareness of nutrition issues and improved priority setting in the eight countries evaluated, and that REACH played a role in this. However, the evaluation found only limited evidence that stakeholders’ commitment was a direct result of this increased awareness of and consensus on nutrition problem",negative
"Less progress was made on investment cases, and this planned output was removed from the priorities in view of other initiatives such as cost-of-hunger profiles. This implied missed opportunities to leverage resources for nutrition priorities as originally envisaged.",negative
"However, plans in all eight cases remained unimplemented because funding was lacking. In two countries, institutional limitations precluded progress towards this outcome.",negative

but there was little joint programming other than that occurring through One United Nations.,negative
Country- level stakeholders had differing opinions as to whether REACH should or could have a coordinating function among United Nations agencies. Progress was strongly affected by the willingness of United Nations agencies to collaborate at the country level. Progress towards this outcome was uneven and depended on local institutional factors and the personalities of country heads of United Nations agencies. REACH’s limited performance in this area highlights the flawed assumption in the theory of change that relatively short-term facilitators at the country level could influence long- standing institutional incentives and political economy factors.,negative
"However, across all countries and stakeholder groups REACH was not strongly associated with having specifically advocated for equity and gender, or with having progressed on the agenda in this area.",negative
"There was some loss in programming efficiency because of delays in the placement of REACH facilitators in all countries. As a result, preliminary data were often out of date and in Bangladesh, Ghana, Mozambique, Rwanda and the United Republic of Tanzania, some of the people involved in formulating CIPs had moved on.",negative
global-level respondents saw it as expensive. In neither case was there a specific cost analysis to address these perceptions.,negative
"however there were reservations about exacerbating the proliferation of tools alongside the tools of other agencies, and about the complexity of some REACH tools, which are difficult for local technical staff to update.",negative
"However, informants indicated that further improvements could be made through better alignment with field- and Headquarters- level priorities, staffing to meet countries’ needs and increasing links to regional United Nations offices.",negative
Most global stakeholders knew little about REACH. This limited approach to partnership reduced REACH’s overall influence.,negative

"However, there are limitations to applying a standard model that is not sufficiently attuned to local realities, under tight timeframes.",negative
"However, there has been an element of overshadowing by the SUN movement, which has contributed to REACH being relatively less known and understood.",negative
"The REACH theory of change did not take sufficient account of factors from outcome to impact level, such as the importance of high-level political commitment from governments, the political economy of the United Nations, and the lack of clear accountability and incentives for support within the United Nations. The latter was undermined by the absence of: i) sustained commitment from the highest level of the convening United Nations agencies; ii) a clear mandate for collaboration from the United Nations; and iii) strong and enforced accountability mechanisms.",negative

"A more active role that includes work and engagement on the ground with potential new partners, namely the private sector and the NGO sector, will be instrumental in sustaining the new biennial CPF consolidating the work in motion.",negative
"This is due to a lack of resources, but also to the fact that the Country Office failed to take an active position on these topics. Increased and more consistent visibility and proactivity on the part of the Country Office would have led to greater recognition of FAO’s capability to guide positive changes on a number of priority topics.",negative
"At the same time, this effort at alignment remains quite formal, and is less evident at the project level.",negative

"FAO rarely provided direct technical assistance for other agencies, and was sometimes perceived as not being able to play an advocacy role on sensitive but important issues.",negative

To date a common strategic discussion between staff at regional and country level over the best kind of partnerships for the country has not taken place.",negative
"However, most activities concentrated on training individuals rather than addressing the organisational capacity or creating an enabling environment. Furthermore, FAO did not have enough resources to meet the country’s needs, nor has it conceptualised its capacity-development support by factoring in the scale of challenges to be met in the country.",negative
"Staff has not been systematically briefed or trained on the topic, and what was aimed to be achieved in this aspect was unclear. Even when research has produced relevant findings on gender in Lao, it has not been disseminated or applied to implementation.",negative

"evertheless, FAO operated in Lao PDR through a very fragmented portfolio of projects which did not follow a coherent programmatic approach, leading to some gaps in the support FAO provided. Due to resource constraints, limits in project design and fragmentation, FAO had varying degrees of achievement across sectors and even within each sector’s various projects. Generally, the work to support changes at the Government level was more successful than the work aimed to make an impact in the field.",negative

"Although adoption of the course in pilot universities seems likely at this time, more effort is needed to anchor ENACT approaches within organizations. Thus far, the development of capacities outside of universities (enabling environment) had been minimal",negative
"This resulted in missed opportunities for linking to governments and communities, scaling up, and enabling a lasting impact. ENAF",negative
"However, the project did not foresee any activities that could lead to better employment opportunities or the application of the acquired knowledge by students.",negative
"Gender equality and the inclusion of women were not sufficiently included in the project design or implementation, and no gender analysis was conducted.",negative
"At a number of points, it has emerged that ILO constituents at national level often lack capacity, sometimes interest, in the area of extending the social protection floor. ILO visibility continues to be lower than it should be.",negative
"ut there is relatively little monitoring and evaluation work at country level, and insufficiency of follow up studies identifying lessons learned and country success stories linked to ILO interventions.",negative
"wever, the Office actively supports social security in over 70 countries in a given biennium, which when compared to the number of technical specialist positions, both in headquarters and especially in field offices, suggests strongly that the technical capacity is stretched very thin.",negative
"Internally, this will probably involve introducing changes to the current configuration of technical support in the various programmes linking it to employment policy development with the aim of improving the coherence of ILO policy messages at country level. In addition, this evaluation also points to the likelihood of additional efficiencies being realized through such a rationalization process. Finally, an improved accountability framework and results orientation for the strategy would improve efforts to generate implementation results at country level",negative
Repeated assistance to countries under the same outcome indicator and country programme activities under overlapping outcome indicators do not adequately reflect the support and progress being made within the broader policy cycle. The monitoring of underlying efficiency differences in NEP processes in different countries misses a defined scope or set of minimum quality standards for NEP formulation. Field employment specialists are not distributed consistently enough to support current and future (pipeline) NEP-supported target countries. Africa-based support in particular appears under supplied.,negative
"However, the reciprocal support could be reinforced to achieve a clearer understanding of the services and tools that are required to meet the conditions set out in the Convention.",negative
This is partly due to national budgetary constraints and internal government coordination issues. Tools and services for these phases within the ILO strategy have only recently been defined.,negative
Country case studies show that this is not automatic and situations can arise where specific groups end up in disadvantageous situations. More attention will need to be paid to this.,negative
"However, the ILO should improve the impact and sustainability of its strategy and capacity by articulating a longer term vision of how countries can support employment policies through all stages of the employment policy cycle.",negative
"The existing indicator framework for the strategic objective on employment does not support clear understanding of country-level outcomes, achievements and progress within broader ILO employment policy initiatives, which may reinforce internal fragmentation.",negative
"There is less evidence that many of those recommendations have actually been implemented or that the programme had thought through the steps required putting those recommendations into effect and the capacities that the programme (and/or the ILO) would have needed to do so. The impact of this programme at this stage at national level therefore remains potential rather than actual. Furthermore, there seems to have been less than optimal communication and exchange between the relevant parts of the ILO concerning:- i) the basic concept, ii) the way data has been collected, analysed, used and made accessible to interested parties, iii) the policy alternatives put forward as a result of the research and their conversion into action.",negative
On the other hand the programme has in several instances worked at arms length with some of the departments concerned. There has been an imperfect meeting of minds within the ILO about which data to collect and the confidence to place in the SES analysis; on how to collect data and on the analysis and interpretation of that data.,negative
"Access to the data, results and the processes of producing them by those outside the programme and sometimes by outside researchers who were directly involved in supporting the programme’s work appears to be uneven. Some parties inside and outside the ILO with a clear a priori “right” of access to the databases and research claimed they had not been able to do so. At present it is not clear who outside of the Office has right of access to what.",negative
"There is a risk that a considerable amount of dedicated work will be wasted and the intellectual capital in which the ILO has invested will be squandered. This would be a suboptimal outcome, particularly in those countries where the SES programme already appears t",negative
"Similarly, the programme’s director was not required to set up a method to monitor the usefulness of research innovations. External donors to the programme appear to not have been demanding in their monitoring expectations.",negative
"For example a flagship publication7 put out in September 2004 was issued as a SES product rather than an ILO-endorsed set of policies, however, with little clarity as to why this distinction was being made. The publication posed challenges to the Office in handling how to distinguish between what was published work that was exploratory and innovative, but that did not represent ILO policy positions. Had it been reviewed with the latter more in mind, it could have converted what is basically an important report raising serious issues into one that the ILO could safely share with the inter-governmental process.",negative
"There is little evidence, however, that much of the analytical work has been converted into actionable policy recommendations.",negative
"Furthermore, an innovative5 programme, exploring issues of potentially great importance for the ILO, has been run without any visible monitoring system to show how the innovation was evolving in the light of experience, and to inform senior management about consequent developments.",negative
"Interaction with the International Advisory Board, set up at the outset to help the programme appears to have flagged after several years6 .",negative
At this moment the programme appears to have lost momentum within the ILO and to be on the verge of dissolution.,negative
"There is little evidence that the management system of the ILO provided the supervision necessary to monitor and give feedback on this largely exploratory research programme, or to attenuate the tensions that may arise between a unit that is potentially redefining organisational practice and the ways that existing programmes and units may be expected to work in the future.",negative
"However, some aspects of design could be improved primarily with respect to the scope of engagements and sequencing of activities. Sometimes, insufficient attention is paid to the nature, magnitude and institutionalization of training for labour inspectors; the design of sanctions and associated administrative and judi- cial procedures; and the development of comprehensive strategies and operating plans for labour inspectorates.",negative
"From a broader institutional perspective, while the Office has established planning and control systems, some deficiencies are apparent. These include: functional limitations in the Integrated Resource Information System (IRIS); the lack of inte- gration of planning, reporting and financial systems; and the absence of a mechanism to inde- pendently validate reported results. Well-defined outcomes and indicators are needed to ensure accountability and provide a basis for continuous improvement.",negative
"In interviews conducted as part of this evaluation, constituents offered different assessments of progress on compliance.",negative
"Representatives of workers’ organizations were more likely than other constituents to suggest that compliance with key legal provisions had seen little or no improvement. While ILO seeks to support member States in keeping with international standards as reflected in Conventions Nos. 81 and 129, responsibility for the application of these Conventions rests solely with these States. Achieving greater compliance with applicable laws and regulation is dependent on numerous social, political and economic factors; it requires actions across multiple fronts.",negative
"However, results vary across countries and lack of consistent data limit analysis.",negative
"en the lack of consistent and reliable labour inspection statistics, there is little to demonstrate that the degree of compliance with labour laws has improved in member States.",negative
There are several reasons for this: a professional and cultural divide between the development staff implementing programmes and the lawyers in the NORMES Department with weak incentives to work together more coherently; an almost total preoccupation in terms of work load with the supervisory system by staff in the NORMES Department; difficulties by staff in other technical areas in understanding the legal processes of ILS; and continued difficulties (in some programme areas more than others) in integrating ILS into Technical Cooperation.,negative
"However, this and other outward looking activities of the Office are curtailed principally by the overwhelming attention given to servicing the supervisory system.",negative
o find extra-budgetary funds for TC activities in the normative function of the ILO remains difficult.,negative
but resource constraints mean that this cannot be done to its fullest extent. Making the links between ILO support and satisfactory outcomes will always be an imperfect science.,negative
"However, this is where the implementation of ILS outside the formal sector must make progress if they are to benefit a large proportion of the population. At this stage without substantial extra funds, the Office can do little more than monitor and take on board good practice lessons from its own experiences.",negative
but with additional resources and cooperation across the Office the broader impact of the ILS could be better understood.,negative
One must recognize that the resources of the Office are not sufficient for all of the mandates and actions it is requested to assume. Progress by consensus is always rather slow and there are some good signs that all parties appreciate the need for reform.,negative
"The evaluation concludes that across the Office, more work is required to satisfactorily mainstream the ILS.",negative
Some means of generating more field experience and understanding of field conditions among NORMES Department staff would bring benefits overall to TC programming and to the efficiency of the supervisory system.,negative
"The challenge to coordinate the technical cooperation and integration of ILS, identified more than twenty years ago, still remains.",negative
Extending the ILS into the informal economy is a considerable challenge with none of the modalities proposed by the Office so far making great headway.,negative
These vary in depth and scope from project to project. There is no comprehensive strategy for mainstreaming FPRW into all of the Office's work despite the policy mandate in the 2008 Declaration.,negative
"These linkages are not uniform and are not always monitored or acknowledged, but they either do occur or have the potential to occur.",negative
"There is no coherent strategic justification for the prioritization of different FPRW principles, nor should there be since ILO policy sees constituent demand as the main driver of DWCP content, despite the obligations in the 1998 Declaration.",negative
Positive developments reflecting the Office's support for improvements in the realization of FPRW may well occur at a level that is not suited to supervision in terms of ratified conventions.,negative
vidence of the Office consistently using these factors in their activities to support constituents in realizing FPRW is mixed.,negative
These efforts are constrained where P&B outcomes and RB resources that flow with them correspond with organizational units.,negative
"This assessment is very obvious when resources are presented in terms of outcomes 14, 15, 16 and 17.",negative
"On examination, it was found that not all global outcome strategies are oriented to the needs expressed by constituents globally or to the gaps identified through supervisory mechanisms.",negative
Institutional factors are reported to limit real operational synergy and successful cases may be unique.,negative
It is not possible to measure the effectiveness of the AR mechanism in channelling TA/TC because there are no strategic indicators that measure TA/TC delivery against AR requests.,negative
"In fact, resources are being allocated to FPRW support but are not recognized as such because of the way projects are linked to CPOs.",negative
"There are clear imbalances in extra-budgetary resources, with those available for the elimination of child labour leading other FPRW categories, although child labour has attracted substantially less resources in recent years.",negative
"Currently, global products are infrequently used as a mechanism for improving efficiency, i.e. providing common FPRW support to constituents globally",negative
"However, the fact that elements are developed individually to comply with monitoring requirements does not necessarily respond to this prerequisite, as it does not transmit the deeper understanding needed to strengthen sustainability.",negative
"Moreover, it prevents the establishment of a common vision.",negative
To this end planning of specific activities for the implementation of the overall strategy or the sub-strategies would be needed. A detailed strategy would reinforce the spirit of the conclusions drawn in the ILC resolution in 2004 and its call for a plan of action that takes into account the established elements.,negative
"This indicates that there may not be a problem with migration tools per se, but with their placement as a crosscutting issue in the generation of integrated programmatic frameworks embodied by the DWCP.",negative
"However, regular budget resources and staffing have not followed as expected to in the follow-up of 2004 ILC resolution, Programme and Budget reflecting the ILC conclusions on the need to mainstream activities and strengthen the International Migration Programme.",negative
"The consequence is that, despite continued regard for its expertise and confidence in its approach and tools, the ILO is not sufficiently present in operational activities in the field of international labour migration.",negative
There is a clear gap to be filled by a comprehensive Office-wide internal strategy paper that formally recognises the cross-cutting nature of the labour migration issue which requires a designation of responsibilities to all parts of the Office so that everyone is required to consider it in their work.,negative
"However, there is room for further cooperation with members of the GMG and other international and regional organizations.",negative
This seems to exclude the many other activities under the other 3 Strategic Objectives of the Office.,negative
"Instead, the ILO’s work on migration is planned through the biennium Programme and Budget (P&B) which links outcomes to Strategic Objective 3: Enhance the coverage and effectiveness of social protection for all as defined as Outcome 3b.2 in the 2006-2007 biennium and is listed as intermediate outcome 3.C in the present biennium.",negative
"Migration is a crosscutting issue that falls under the various spheres of action of the ILO, but the current programme and budget reporting mechanism makes it nearly impossible to obtain information on expenditures realized by the different sectors in support of this activity.",negative
"Ideally, the strategy should have an implementation plan with indicators, milestones and targets.",negative
Relevant international labour standards on migration are not well reflected in DWCPs according to analysis conducted by the evaluation team.,negative
"Still there were a number of interview responses stating that ILO had lost a significant amount of ground in OSH-related global issues. The reasons the interviewees gave was the activity of other similarly oriented international organizations, the minimal agreements between many constituents which prohibit the ILO playing a more advanced role in OSH, a lack of collaboration between ILO and other global organizations, and missed opportunities to promote OSH to donor organizations. Consequently, the formerly undisputed position of ILO as a global leader in OSH-related issues, and OSH standard setting, is likely to become increasingly vulnerable.",negative

"In general, TC projects would benefit from more SafeWork involvement during the identification and design phase to ensure more emphasis is placed on capacity building and sustainability.",negative
"Only a few provided details on situational analysis, client and outcome analysis, identification of strategies and assumptions, management plans and implementation processes.",negative
"In addition, progress reporting and evaluations were not consistent in assessing progress against objectives, i.e. no consistency of achievements between P&B documents and programme implementation reports for Outcome 6.",negative
"Howvere, measurability and quantification are better the closer they come to the implementation of Conventions, Recommendations and Protocols.",negative
"However, the information flows between project, field offices and headquarters are not clear and often dilute accountability for delivery.",negative
"regional technical cooperation often requires communication, coordination and technical support from DWTs.",negative
"Some of them, such as the OSH management guidelines, only show an impact years or even decades after their introduction. There is no feedback system on the usage of publications – documentation on product reaction, order numbers, translations – or products.",negative
Reliable data on occupational accidents and diseases are a necessary precondition for impact assessment and prioritization of OSH activities.,negative
Evidence gathered through this evaluation indicates that SafeWork could have improved the efficiency of OSH activities through better coordination and communication between field and headquarters staff and project management.,negative
An assessment of the immediate impact of SafeWork products and activities is difficult.,negative

In addition, the Strategic Management Module does not allow the contributions made by the various ILO units to be measured in a systematic manner. Therefore, the effectiveness of the ILO’s Outcome 13 strategies cannot be accurately determined",negative
What exists is a de jure “strategy” for sectoral- specific decent work expressed in the P&B and also a de facto “strategy” contained in the SAP. Each strategy has a unique set of sub-issues that have far reaching implications.,negative
It is questionable to hold SECTOR accountable for the indicators contained in the P&B while the work to be done for sectoral activities is planned under a different and autonomous procedure over which it has little control.,negative
"There is in fact, little in the way of a cogent strategy to achieve Outcome 13, at least in the generally accepted sense of the word.",negative
"However, the difficulties of valuing its sectoral work, which is, by and large, normative in nature, may preclude the ILO from being able to demonstrate the comparative advantage of its sectoral work in the UN development system of the future.",negative
but this agenda was not adequately reflected in the P&B’s performance indicators. This incoherence may have led to inconsistencies and errors in reporting.,negative
"More work however, needs to be done.",negative
"although it was noted that links might need to be strengthened beyond its traditional partner ministries. While skills development has clear synergies with other crosscutting work of the ILO, the P&B processes in place at the time the evaluation was carried out might have created a disincentive for collaboration.",negative
"Given the high demand and need, however, further guidance may be needed on organizational priorities, including geographical focus.",negative
"This lack of coherence and alignment could have led to inconsistencies and errors in reporting, as country offices might have been faced with the difficult choice of either adhering strictly to the Strategic Policy Framework or adjusting their reporting to fit better with the global results framework. Furthermore, there was a lack of clarity regarding the composition and definition of ILO’s skills strategy",negative

"However, the field visits did not find much hard evidence of this.",negative
A number of significant constraints to operational efficiency and effectiveness were identified through the survey.,negative
"However, no data were available on the actual number of countries assessed as having attained this goal.",negative
The fact that evaluation topics are set on a yearly basis has impeded both use and consultation.,negative
It is the only UN system organization to follow this pattern. The location conveys an impression of lack of independence.,negative
"However, there is little effective connection between evaluation and results-based management within the Office. Self-evaluation at the programme level is not as well developed as would be hoped, although a number of exercises show promise.",negative
"There have been training initiatives, but the results have been uneven and there is an expressed need for additional training at all levels, including for stakeholders. While there has been an effort to engage stakeholders in a participatory process in evaluations, this has not always been considered satisfactory.",negative
"At the same time, the full potential of institutional learning from the evaluations has not yet been realized.",negative
"There is little connection between the high-level evaluations and results-based management represented by the Strategic Policy Framework, biennial programme budgets or programme implementation reports.",negative
"As with the accountability objective, the IEE finds that use of the evaluations for management purposes is uneven.",negative
"Gender integration differs across country programmes, but generally lacks explicit focus and monitoring where there is no specialized gender support capacity.",negative
The available data did not allow a comprehensive assessment of the achievement of these goals.,negative
"However, country and global operations are to a large extent financed through technical cooperation resources. Despite TC expenditures of an estimated US$80 million per biennium, many projects continue to be too stand-alone, with separate websites, results frameworks and reporting practices.",negative
"The review of the projects, however, shows that transitioning from a largely technical cooperation approach focusing heavily on training takes time and may not be as readily financed by donors.",negative
"Without this, ILO country offices tend to respond to shorter term and pragmatic approaches to enterprise development, which governments demand and donors fund, tending to overlook opportunities for longer term and more systematic change, in the hope of offering simple solutions to complex problems.",negative
"A more concentrated effort and more targeting through sectors, communities and vulnerable groups would add focus, increase visibility and, potentially, have a higher impact.",negative
"The dependency on two donors, however, poses uncomfortable risks for this promising area of work, which could flounder if funding were not sustained.",negative
"The work to promote enterprise associations and cooperative enterprises was found to have great potential but is currently underdeveloped, in large part due to limited funds and, as yet, too few cases of cooperative approaches being integrated into small enterprise development technical cooperation. There is a clear need to focus on innovative models that attract young entrepreneurs and meet their needs through solid business performance and value added, delivered through cooperatives to their members.",negative
ut is fragmented. There is also a need to reduce external and internal user barriers and to integrate content and messages to encompass the broader Decent Work Agenda.,negative
"However, the level of effort across the various indicators has been uneven, with more effort and resources focusing on entrepreneurship projects and programmes than on other pillars.",negative
There is currently no clear orientation and coordination within the Office on how the sustainable enterprise strategy could tap such resources in the longer term for small enterprise strategy development at the country level.,negative
This engagement needs to go beyond private sector partnerships and the Office is struggling to articulate an actionable strategy.,negative
"It is weak in terms of explicit development-oriented objectives, reducing its value added and relevance as a framework for the implementation of ILO TC during the period in question.",negative
"The lowest level of coherence was found in countries that did not have formal ILO representation. Here, project teams tend to run their projects separately, and there is less systematic coherence and coordination.",negative
"In none of the cases reviewed were the DWCPs costed and anchored in budgets. As a result, they are somewhat theoretical and, unless costed, cannot be the basis for realistic results-based management (RBM).",negative
"This figure contrasts negatively with the 5 or 7 per cent support costs charged by several other UN funds and programmes and nongovernmental organiza- tions (NGOs) as well as the 5 per cent that is rapidly becoming the norm under UNDAPs. However, it is not clear whether the overheads charged by other agencies and NGOs are an accurate or realistic reflection of their administrative costs or whether they include the same elements in their calculations as the ILO when determining support costs.",negative
"These were mostly associated with delays in recruitment or procurement. Some ILO TC project personnel, in countries lacking a country representative, were strongly critical of the difficulties they face because of their lack of authority over recruitment, procurement and financial management. This has proved particularly challenging in instances where their managers (based in other offices) are unavailable for long periods of time and have failed to nominate temporary replacements.",negative
"This results in infrequent or insufficient field missions, particularly with regard to country portfolio and policy development, and results in missed opportunities. It is for pro- gramme staff to develop relationships of trust and conduct a sustained policy dialogue under such condi- tions. Furthermore, some project personnel perform representational and administrative support functions beyond their core responsibilities in countries without country directors, cutting into their core project management responsibilities.",negative
"The evaluation, therefore, concludes that there are currently insufficient data to enable the impact of ILO TC to be evaluated.",negative
"Sustainability is also limited by a narrow understanding of “capacity development” which at the ILO is apparently usually equated with training rather than with a more holistic approach to systems that address institution building, structures, processes and national policy frameworks.",negative
"Coordination activities by YEP to support internal coherence and complementarity have been hindered by its limited empowerment and lack of dedicated human resources. This is a major constraint in trying to technically anchor the large and growing portfolio of projects, people and agencies involved in ILO youth employment initiatives.",negative
"However, the evaluation found some bottlenecks linked to the public-private partnership (PPP) approach being implemented in the Americas and mismatches between youth employment as a priority and regional capacities for supporting it in Africa.",negative
"The degree of youth employment coordination among various ministries, government agencies and the social partners has been reported as generally low for many of the countries where the ILO is working on youth employment. There are often conflicting priorities across ministries, which deter efforts to integrate approaches within the public sector. A more strategic and results-oriented approach to decision-making on national interventions could contribute to increased effectiveness and target specialized needs (i.e. enlarged network of stakeholders, disadvantaged youth groups).",negative
"As some evaluation case studies indicate, more work has to be done to generate among ILO partners an integrated approach specifically focused on youth employment.",negative
"The multi-faceted character of interventions requires multi-disciplinary approaches, and this is why youth employment initiatives are normally multi-departmental. The Youth Employment Programme is an important ILO resource to generate integration and coordination of interventions, but it lacks adequate dedicated resources and an administrative presence to create and manage a complex internal partnership arrangement.",negative
There are a number of areas where coordination could be strengthened.,negative
"As already mentioned, current coordination between headquarters and the field mostly involves staff attached to the Employment Sector. However, as set out in the initiative’s design, complementary interventions that target youth and contribute to their improved conditions are situated in programmes elsewhere such as child labour and social protection. More can be done to enhance coordination and/or cooperation with these sectors and programmes to better support an intertwining of youth development policies, employment and other social policies.",negative
"In many countries, governments have not taken the necessary steps to address the magnitude of the youth employment challenge.",negative
"In order for tripartism to be effective, interventions to strengthen the capacity of representatives of employers’ and workers’ organizations can be better integrated and this requires stronger coordination between the Bureau for Workers’ Activities (ACTRAV), the Bureau for Employers’ Activities (ACTEMP) and ILO field offices supporting youth employment initiatives.",negative
"he expectations that the ILO would take the lead in coordinated national efforts and an integrated course of action on youth employment have not been completely satisfied due to uneven ILO capacities in leading inter-agency interventions in some countries, but particularly where the ILO has limited country presence.",negative
"n other UN joint initiatives, the ILO has met with more limited success.",negative
"As the lead technical UN agency, the ILO will have to develop not only the expertise but also the organizational and management systems to reduce the high transaction costs associated with multi-agency processes. A specific responsibility and set of tools are needed to do this in the Office, which would enable YEP to better coordinate within its limited capacities.",negative
"The integrated, multi-agency and multi-sector approach that has evolved for youth employment has proven challenging for the Office to manage, given the high transaction costs associated with the new planning, decision-making and implementation processes for joint programming, and the rapid increase in the number of joint programmes which the ILO is called upon to technically support.",negative

"However, given that, in opera- tional terms, ILO is not a humanitarian agency, it has often played a secondary role in the humanitarian field. This has frequently resulted in: the marginalization of topics related to employment and social dia- logue in reconstruction plans; reduction in the amount of funds allocated to the topics covered by the ILO; insufficient involvement of the social partners in setting out strategies and reconstruction plans, recovery and development; and exclusion of ILO from the overall rebuilding process.",negative
"This meant that the DWCP was not readily evaluable, in part because of the nature and definition of outcomes and in part because of the difficulty in gaining sound evidence linking DWCP activities to outcomes.",negative

ome of the findings suggested that the focus on some of these ‘hard’ areas of ILO activities has decreased.,negative
The subsequent recommendations stressed the need to strengthen capabilities in areas such as labour law and labour administration.,negative
Social dialogue capacities and sound industrial relations are important external factors often hindering positive outcomes.,negative
"There are also obstacles specific to certain types of interventions. For example, a number of evaluation reports of multi-country projects stressed that the objectives and operational designs did not (or only insufficiently) match the specific national situations",negative
"Although the evaluations raised these issues, they did not resolve them.",negative
"however, a backlog in terms of practical implementation continues to exist. The integration of social finance as a natural ingredient in employment promotion and social protection in the Decent Work Country Programmes is uneven, although improvements have been noted towards the end of the period.",negative
"rationale for making decisions about whether a finance component should be included and if so: how, are often not expressed in project document. Risks (external factors that can disturb or destroy an intervention) are often not considered, or if they are, then in overly optimistic ways. The lead time to start up a project or other planned activity is typically underestimated, often leading to long delays and serious problems to arrive at completion, or even complete failure to deliver useful results.",negative
Most of the work is with individual organisations rather than with national associations.,negative
"However, both projects are too recent for tangible outcomes to be expected within the time frame of this evaluation.",negative
"Cases were noted where investments were lost due to delays. The MF4DW also saw initial delays which, together with unanticipated complexity of the start-up phase, led to a situation where the contracts of the professional team are running out before any of the 16 innovations have come to maturity and comparisons can be made; hence without additional funding to keep staff on the team to finish the job, the whole investment may be los",negative
"The SFP has a special responsibility to deal with the apparent limited knowledge of SF in many TC projects and Country Offices, as well as perceptions by some that social finance is a Headquarters project. The Social Finance Network has played less of an integrating role than anticipated.",negative
n spite of some cultural differences between the more commercial microinsurance environment and the social orientation of the ILO there are many indications that there is scope for a better integration between them to become more of one coherent programme.,negative
"owever, the absence of internal communication within the ILO is problematic.",negative
"ocial finance is a cross-cutting issue in many ILO TC projects, but good SF practices are not always followed.",negative
"This reflects the knowledge and understanding of social finance at the field level, which is still too dependent on the professional background and interest of individual ILO staff members. The social finance concept has not yet sufficiently penetrated the ILO structures.",negative
ILO remains a minor player on the vast international microfinance scene.,negative
"The lack of attention in the project designs, the relatively short duration, and the slow implementation of many SF interventions are threats to sustainability.",negative
Constituent ownership of the results was also found to be only partly successful.,negative
Evidence of risks being effectively managed was found to be highly variable.,negative
This is largely due to a lack of performance information on such outcomes being yet available for the DWCP evaluators to make such assessments for these evaluations. H,negative
"ever, the evaluators expressed concern over whether sufficient attention and resources were being allocated to Decent Work issues for which it is more difficult to mobilize resources such as social dialogue5 , including labour market flexibility and job security and practices.",negative
"It is a challenging task to move beyond assessing the achievements of individual projects to assessing the achievements in terms of DWCP outcomes. To be able to do so, the DWCP evaluation framework needs to be thought through when the DWCP is being designed.",negative
"Thus, it has been a considerable and ongoing adjustment process to develop a more focused and coherent Decent Work programme targeting the needs of the country concerned which is owned by the constituents.",negative
"While the conceptual shift to a DWCP approach was progressing, it generally moved ahead of the organizational and institutional arrangements needed to support its implementation and the achievement of its objectives.",negative
Such frameworks were generally found to be inadequate to effectively evaluate the DWCPs.,negative
"wever, strengthening national capacity for market facilitation was an ambitious objective for a 3-year project that aimed to generate and effectively manage technical knowledge on systemic approaches to market development. As such, it is still to be seen if there was any success in sustainably building capacity within national stakeholders for market facilitation through the limited set of capacity building activities that were done.",negative
"The degree to which this credibility effectively translated into systemic changes in ILO’s portfolio of projects was limited in Phase 1, as that in itself would require a systemic approach to shifting the status quo in terms of how the ILO designs and implements market development projects, which was not an explicit objective of the first phase.",negative
"However, as far as the collaboration with projects goes, in certain situations, the Lab’s approach could have been better adapted to the existing implementation and reporting protocols at the ILO, and operational context of projects.",negative
"t. Given the timescale and resources available in Phase II of the Lab, it doesn’t seem likely that the Lab team will be able to position its staff closer to regions with high density of market system development programmes. It will be more impactful for the Lab to focus on its key objective of knowledge generation and adopt a collaborative approach to mainstreaming this approach within and outside the ILO.",negative
There have been varying levels of investment and success in the three key objectives.,negative
"The use of annual progress and final reports to the donors and Programme Implementation Reports do not allow for critical and comprehensive analysis of results achieved, nor the identification of opportunities, and challenges. This limits the scope for improvement and discussion around possible synergies.",negative
"n terms of project management, several shortcomings related to the design, implementation, and monitoring and reporting of the interventions associated with Outcome 17 under the Norway and Sweden PAs, were identified during the evaluation process.",negative
"Although the donors’ requirements regarding monitoring and reporting are limited, the ILO could benefit from having more rigorous and more frequent reporting frameworks in place.",negative
the displacement of Syrian people into Lebanon; two major earthquakes in Nepal greatly affected project activities; and Ukraine experienced ongoing conflict.,negative
"the whole, employers did not engage or feature strongly in the overall GAP-MDW project.",negative
"Bidding regulations in the EU does not encourage hiring extra ILO project staff in country offices, nor does it allow for flexibility during implementation.",negative
"Many of the challenges related to a lack of dedicated staff to this project, coordinating across units at headquarters, as well as budgets and co-financing requirements. Management of the project often relied on the good will of country offices.",negative
he project was reliant on ILO national officers or partners reporting.,negative
"The GAP-MDW project did not have an objective to focus adequately on MDWs themselves, although it strove to reach MDWs through partners, encouraging trade unions to represent this category of worker with IDWF reaching out through their electronic platform.",negative
"Project management challenges related the complexity of commissioning multi-country studies, handling 5 migration corridors with multiple sites and organizations that were intended to generate information towards concrete legislative change in each corridor as well as for global action and advocacy to protect MDWs.",negative
This was lacking in the GAP MDW project.,negative
"However, ensuring that W4Y was relevant as a discernible input into policy, programme or dialogue proved to be very challenging. The team found few instances where stakeholders saw the SWTS as an important input into the major government policy and program initiatives to youth employment. I",negative
"observable linkage, other actions like a follow on project supported by W4Y or the active involvement of a development partner in driving the policy process seemed to be the determining factor.",negative
"However, this is not the case for all the search results and use of the underlying data generated by the project could increase with more investment in dissemination and communication.",negative
"While ILO and MCF have utilized and disseminated SWTS information there has to date been limited use of the SWTS microdata, SWTS reports and the YouthPOL database among global stakeholders. The potential value (or impact) of the investment in assembling this global repository of detailed information will diminish over time unless there are additional efforts to: gather comparable information in more counties, gather comparable information in countries over time and expand the user base for the information. The diminishing value of the global outputs highlights the challenge of sustainability",negative
"This was specifically mentioned in Togo and Malawi, but the concern about the country report relevance and process for promoting buy-in at the country level was identified in the Mid- Term evaluation. Again, this constraint on impact at the country level is linked to the scarcity of resources for complementary country-level work and the assumption that the ILO could mobilize sufficient capacity at the country level",negative
It is at the country level that the ambiguity in defining the project objective makes assessing effectiveness more difficult.,negative
"From a value for money perspective, only a portion of the potential value of the project has been realized as of yet.",negative
"Without the additional investment to support the kinds of actions described above, project impact at the global level will diminish as the information becomes less timely and further development and dissemination of the methodology ends.",negative
"Aside from research, good practices, lessons learned and tools still need to be exchanged at a much higher rate to inform HIV in the world of work in different countries and settings.",negative
"Although gender issues have been identified in the Code of Practice, Recommendation 200 and other ILO documents, the ILO strategy on gender and HIV in the world of work is still not very strong. Isolated efforts have been undertaken but gender needs to be more solidly and explicitly integrated across HIV in the world of work programming.",negative
"National strategies to address HIV and AIDS in many case countries remain concentrated on health sector, with prevention and the wider social protection systems receiving less attention.",negative
"Despite the fact that the ILO has developed very interesting good practices on HIV in the context of the informal economy worker, a great deal more effort is needed to reach the very large number of informal economy workers, job seekers and others among poor and vulnerable workers.",negative
"At country level, development partners working on HIV often are not very familiar with the ILO‘s tripartite process and its work with Ministries of Labour although there is an increasing recognition of the need to integrate and associate multiple partners.",negative
"However, some ILO program managers involved in implementation thought the global level intervention strategy would have been more effective if it were more focused, with fewer strategic outputs.",negative
"However, several research products and training tools were not yet finalized or diffused by the end of the project implementation period.",negative
"n other cases, sustainability may hinge on the ability of the ILO to continue its support for a longer period of time.",negative
"In some cases the project design envisaged needs assessments and gap analysis that were not finally developed. As a consequence, in the implementation phase some project activities could not be considered appropriately adapted to the constituent’s capacities.",negative
"This has problematized project tracking from headquarters, the eventual communication of information between the offices and countries that form part of the project and the availability of data that is disaggregated by gender.",negative
"The exchange of experiences and the South-South activities have been scant in the project, with the exception of several constituents’ participation in the ASEAN Labour Inspection Conference. The fact that the countries covered by the project are from many different regions has made it difficult to encourage South-South cooperative activities.",negative
The project has not had a monitoring system.,negative
romoting employment impact assessments is currently not a standard practice in ILO projects.,negative
"implified, tailored and more practical technical training modules need to be developed. A knowledge transfer strategy should also be systematized, formalized and monitored by the project.",negative
"Despite the dedication of ILO HQ and country project teams to keep up with tight deadlines, the project has faced strong delays and requires continuous, strong and proactive dedication of all administrative support staff to reach expected results.",negative
No knowledge transfer strategy has yet been defined by the project.,negative
Assessing the likelihood of sustainability of results at the country level is tricky at this stage.,negative
Monitoring tools and processes have not been sufficiently tailored to the needs of project implementers. The project does not integrate gender equality related objectives in the logframe at the design stage of the project.,negative
re is currently low involvement of Delegations of the EU in the project at the country level.,negative
"However the less detailed reporting requirements by the donor associated with Outcome-Based Funding did also mean that reporting against the log frame indicators has not been systematically compiled at the country level, which could present problem for institutional memory.",negative
These factors affected action and decision making and directed efforts away from a more operational and strategic implementation.,negative
"The division of duties in project management between CEPOL and YEP resulted in diluted and unclear management, coordination and reporting responsibilities.",negative
The organizational and system levels of capacity development received less attention.,negative
"but not the sole, main or indeed sufficient provider of capacity development services to the Organization.",negative
The ratings in the assessment below reflect identified performance level with the caveat that lack of consistent data lowered ratings for certain criterion.,negative
"However, social dialogue and tripartism disappeared as a separate outcome in the programmes and budgets for 2016–2017 and was included instead as a cross- cutting policy driver, reducing its visibility across the Organization and as an area of result.",negative
"Capacity development is a cross-cutting issue, but responsibility in the ILO is not clearly situated within the organizational structure other than for the social partners: the Bureau for Employers’ Activities (ACT/ EMP) and the Bureau for Workers’ Activities (ACTRAV). There is no assigned custodian in the ILO to coordinate capacity development for government agencies in terms of policy development, knowledge management, implementation support, guidance, and supervision.",negative
"e ILO appears to be spending a considerable amount on capacity development, but the financial tracking system does not easily allow for this to be aggregated and analysed, which in turn, makes it hard to assess whether value for money is achieved.",negative
"While there is greater recognition of the role of DW in poverty reduction, better elaboration of the link between the two is needed.",negative
"The ILO has undertaken initiatives in line with the need to develop measurement indicators for DW, although a better assessment of the existing statistical capacities of each of the countries would have been useful.",negative
"While there are positive examples (ILO-IMF cooperation), better coherence is needed in the measurement of DW.",negative
"However, to some extent, the lack of internal coherence within the ILO poses a risk to the effectiveness of this initiative, especially because of the multiple assessments3 in place concurrently.",negative
Capacity building was found to be less effective if the enabling environment is lacking.,negative
"However, the effectiveness of its application has remained low.",negative
"So far, systems for learning across organizations do not sufficiently support the sharing of knowledge and experience on the mainstreaming of DW.",negative
Vertical coherence between activities at HQ and at RO and CO levels has been mixed.,negative
Horizontal coherence between the components of the outcome Strategy in a given country also could be improved through the DWCPs.,negative
"ILO visibility is rather low in some countries, ultimately hindering the mainstreaming of DW, which is largely due to the lack of a wider communications strategy.",negative
"Low national ownership and funding (in some countries), lack of the necessary expertise, lack of clarity related to ILO commitment to continued support, and inadequate horizontal coherence within the ILO were found to be key limitations to sustainability.",negative
It also does not provide guidance on promoting cross-fertilization and collaboration with other outcomes. The DWCPs are the most effective vehicles for delivering ILO support to member States.,negative
"Regarding the relevance of the ILO strategy, the team found that, while the strategy under Outcome 17 provides a global sense of direction for the implementation of non-discrimination work, it is not explicitly linked to the high-level strategic guidance laid out in the GRs, APs, and the GJP.",negative
"The employment-intensive construction methods are disadvantaged by long-held national and international concerns about the management intensity for government institutions and their contractors, and perceived risks linked to the relatively slow disbursement of funds. In some countries there are perceptions of the methodology being donor-driven rather than nationally owned. Finally, corruption remains a major problem within infrastructure investment and there is some resistance to the increased transparency associated with these methods, particularly given the range of EIIS management tools for effective management and local governance.",negative
"The ILO has the mandate and expertise to carry out the objectives of the programme but lacks the full leverage to bring about the policy, institutional and philosophical change needed without more support from key influential institutions at global, regional and national levels.",negative
"There are wide disparities in the number of countries covered by each regional office (RO), Decent Work Technical Support Team (DWT) and by each country office (CO), as well as in the office architecture. Constituents, staff and donors expressed concerns that the offices serving a large number of countries are unreasonably overstretched.",negative
"here is no apparent systema- tic approach for addressing ILO’s representation in NRCs, which also results in varying levels of demand being placed on DWTs and country offices. The inequities were greatest for Africa and the Arab States.",negative
"More generally, issues emanating from resource constraints have slowed the pace of reform.",negative
The extent to which programme and budget proposals are based on an assessment of needs is not clear as budgets only marginally change from one biennium to the next.,negative
"oncerns remain about the extent to which DWCPs can be implemented, and about the level of effort required for their development.",negative
"ignificant differences in NRCs, however, were once again observed.",negative
More flexibility in financial and human resource management is needed for decentralization efforts to lead to decisions at the field level.,negative
"There does not appear to be a systematic process for determining demand at country or regional levels although the process of developing DWCPs partly serves this purpose. Whene- ver new technical needs emerge, the lack of agility or flexibility in the biennial budgetary and program- ming process, and lengthy recruitment and mobility processes, inhibit responsiveness.",negative
This is a major factor in determining whether or not the ILO is an effective partner in all UNCTs. Dispa- rity in the number of countries covered by offices in the field needs to be addressed to ensure quality and equitable delivery of services.,negative
Knowledge management and commu- nication systems need to be improved in the context of a culture of sharing to make the work of the FOS more effective.,negative
"sues not yet acted upon include progress on reviewing the actual costs involved in supporting technical cooperation (TC), including the distribution of the collected PSI funds as indicated in the Implementation Plan and in a recommendation in the high-level technical cooperation evaluation on more timely and more transparent PSI distribution within departments and regions.",negative
"Although a staff mobility procedure is in place, there is minimal evidence of staff movement in practice, although some differences and variations between regions and departments were observed.",negative
"his, along with issues about incentives for national staff being lower than in other UN system agencies, is a concern for many people.",negative
"edicated financial and staffing resources for the ILO’s work on gender have gene- rally declined over the review period, but the demand for ILO expertise and the opportunities for resource mobilization have been on the increase, particularly in the context of SDG 8 on decent work and SDG 5 on gender equality.",negative
"Provision of technical support appears to be driven more by supply than demand, including where donor resources are available.",negative
"In the field, there is low awareness of the reform efforts despite high interest, with the pace of reform generally perceived to be slow.",negative
Evidence suggests that the ILO is less effective in countries lacking a resident designated ILO official.,negative
It is still mostly a one-way connection between HQ and the field.,negative
"This is in part explained by the fact that the implementation of the MCOF at these levels does not always imply additional allocation of resources. However, as the MCOF is a tool for fostering improved internal coordination and programmatic coherence at all levels, a strengthening of the internal coordination mechanisms and the allocation of resources on a consistent and ongoing basis are required for undertaking comprehensive assessments and developing response strategies at different stages of a crisis with mobility dimensions, including in anticipation of or in the wake of a crisis situation.",negative
"ooking at how resources have been converted into outputs, data reveals that few IOM staff at the country and regional levels have in fact analysed the financial and administrative requirements for effectively applying the MCOF in implementing preparedness, response, and transition and recovery activities.",negative
The exclusion of some projects in post-crisis situations which focus on technical assistance for migration management was problematic as this is contrary to the spirit of the Facility.,negative
"The report notes, however, that, with the expansion of the Facility, the number of projects to review, comment on and submit to the IOM Director General for approval has been increasing. Furthermore, the improved management, through the creation of two databases that require constant monitoring, information sharing with IOM Member States and the monitoring of information exchanges with IOM Missions on project endorsement and implementation, has put pressure on the two IOM staff in charge of the Facility.",negative
One Member State also proposed that the criteria and guidelines be reviewed in the light of the outcome of the current IOM budget reform process.,negative
"The concrete benefits of using a ToT as a means of expanding role out, to ensure the replication and monitoring are recognised, in particular in the Philippines, and would require further efforts in Indonesia.",negative
Further funding for coordination and priority setting in the destination countries of Italy and the Netherlands could have been beneficial.,negative
"Further inclusion of other project stakeholders such as formal partners or associates could also have increased the capacity development in the medium term of government, civil society, diaspora groups and other main actors. The Steering Committee meetings composition, and responsibilities should have been set out during the inception meeting and reviewed during implementation.",negative
"Such outreach could have ensured more systematic access to existing materials, and expert input.",negative
but could have clearly benefited from additional support in the area of communication from MRF Manila.,negative
the delay in finalizing publications has meant that it has had limited use by local stakeholders to conduct research in remittance channels between and within in S. E. Asia and the EU.,negative
"It is felt that the project’s design and implementation could have gained more through earlier recruitment of the project management team, less ambitious parameters and earlier conclusion of the research and implementation of pilot activities, as well as greater inclusion of project partners in the Steering Committee meetings.",negative
"The benefits to the direct beneficiaries, i.e. migrants would have had the most relevance to objective 4 – Improve remittance transfer services, and provide remittance transfers through formal financial institutions. This component could have benefited from further expansion and replication among migrants themselves.",negative
The Government counterparts as well as key IOM implementing missions have been absent from the Steering Committee meetings.,negative
"Network and dialoguing has mainly limited to protect partners, and could have benefited from a more systematic external communications strategy.",negative
"Bilateral dialogue mechanisms between S. E Asia and the EU are likely to be sustained over the longer term, but are likely to require further resources and prioritization",negative
"However, as the MCOF is a tool for fostering improved internal coordination and programmatic coherence at all levels, a strengthening of the internal coordination mechanisms and the allocation of resources on a consistent and ongoing basis are required for undertaking comprehensive assessments and developing response strategies at different stages of a crisis with mobility dimensions, including in anticipation of or in the wake of a crisis situation.",negative
"An identified weakness was the imbalance between promotional activities in Italy and in the selected countries of origin, which did not aid promotion of the MIDA concept in those countries, already affected by low institutional commitment.",negative
"The project document and implementation however entirely lacked gender focus, which should be rectified in the extension phase under discussion and other future MIDA projects.",negative
"The project was not effective in transferring skills and capacity building activities, as no transfer took place, contrary to initial plans.",negative
No investment projects were implemented.,negative
"However, the results in terms of contribution to development are weak and the overall approach requires further analysis.",negative
"However, its sustainability prospects remain entirely donor driven.",negative
"The project came to the end of its cycle, and in case the time extension is not granted, the project results will not be fully reached as the capacity building and technical expertise essential for the running of the Centre will not be available any longer.",negative
"Apart from neighbourhood opposition, the municipal and national elections and the referendum, a difficult economic situation in the country additionally prolonged the efficient Open Centre set up. Capital controls following the parliamentary elections in September 2015 disrupted procurement, contracting and refurbishing procedures.",negative
"At Headquarter level, the private sector liaison team in the Donor Relations Department (DRD) remains small with the Head also having other donor liaison functions. Overall, there are limited dedicated human resources for private sector and most of the interviewees considered it to be inadequate particularly for an Organization that is highly dependent on fundraising and voluntary contributions.",negative
"There are nonetheless key factors that need to be addressed to achieve the Strategy, such as increasing human resources, finetuning institutional processes or improving the understanding of how to engage with private sector.",negative
"There are however other efforts such as knowledge management, which were not implemented (due mostly to lack of human and financial resources), putting sustainability efforts at risk. The lack of commitment for predictable funding is a major obstacle to both ensuring outcomes are met and that they become sustainable.",negative
"At the regional level, private sector engagement varied according to opportunity, the capacity and resources to implement it and actively seek partnerships.",negative
"The reasons given for a negative rating were mainly the limited funds and therefore action, absence of government response and interest and regional dispersal affecting implementation.",negative
"DMM and DOE managers note however that responsibilities over the management of migrant children assistance are not always clearly drawn between the departments, sharing of information can be improved and the challenges in programme implementation are increased with the lack of a comprehensive institutional policy.",negative
"veyed offices note shortcomings due to resource constraints not only at IOM level but also with the governments and other partners, which makes the implementation of gender guidelines quite strenuous.",negative
"However, financial constraints limit such a close monitoring of victims, which ranges from none at the end of the project to a period of six to nine months. A lack of analysis and/or evaluation also prevents IOM from measuring the impact of prevention activities and of IOM assistance to migrant children.",negative
Monitoring challenges remain in cases of the assistance provided to children victims of trafficking.,negative
"however, the evaluation recommends IOM to include outcome and impact analysis of CERF funding projects more frequently when conducting evaluations of its emergency responses.",negative
"This disjointedness has increased the risk of duplication, which needs to be addressed moving forward, as this results in a waste of money, time and human resources, and can create confusion when it comes to storing, sharing and managing knowledge in the Organization.",negative
Survey respondents and interviewees were also split on the issue of the extent that existing IOM policies and strategies facilitate knowledge management and its institutionalization in the Organization.,negative
"The Modification to Cooperative Agreement No. 12 was also awaited since November 2017 due to the donor considering new funding and an extension until the end of 2018, allowing the implementation of additional activities. The modification of the cooperative agreement was finalized in May 2018.",negative
One finding was that the indicators of the project were different from those in the CCCM strategy and they could have been better streamlined.,negative
"Some aspects of coordination, such as sharing more information on each of the components, could have been improved in order to streamline the activities and identify lessons learnt that could be relevant for the Cluster as a whole.",negative
"Based on the input from Global Team members, the evaluation recommends to better define selection criteria to maximize the benefits and prioritize deployments.",negative
"CCCM should capitalize on its current efforts with CP partners to ensure that, during evacuations, displacement is well managed.",negative
"Whilst matching civil protection with CCCM expertise has proven challenging at times, civil protection has been identified as integral to humanitarian assistance.",negative
"However, as DTM activities continue to expand, it is important that appropriate human resources are in place to match the expansion of activities.",negative
". However, existing DTM M&E mechanisms require important attention to effectively report on the DTM activities, including recommendations for future strategic moves such as the development and coordination of DTM activities in the field and securing donor funding.",negative
"evertheless, the resources and efforts for mainstreaming gender in DTM activities need to be increased.",negative
"Externally, the promotion and advertisement of the DTM among partners, governments, donors, and other key stakeholders is done on an ad-hoc basis, which could be strengthened through the clarification of the DTM objectives and the development of a strategy for DTM.",negative
"Yet, more efforts are required to ensure DTM activities are implemented in a timely manner.",negative
"The challenge now is to maintain this momentum, along with the growing interest in the DTM.",negative
and suggested that IOM should reconsider its strategy when an emergency has become protracted or has turned into a chronic situation.,negative
"Some Member States suggested that more information could be included in the Annual Report on the different crises for which MEFM was activated, and on the status of reimbursements.",negative
"The Mechanism benefited from contributions from 12 Member States which totalled USD 11.2 million, representing only 38 per cent of the target",negative
"Nonetheless, the remaining balance as at 31 December 2015 is low due to the difficulty in obtaining reimbursements.",negative
"Moreover, if this aspect of the Mechanism does not function more effectively, the operational balance will soon be rendered ineffective.",negative
"One of the main reasons for the difficulty in obtaining reimbursements is the lack of interest of IOM donors in reimbursing amounts used for evacuations, which represented 71 per cent of the funds to be repaid as at 31 December 2015. Another reason is the reluctance of donors to use their contributions for retroactive reimbursements of operations funded by MEFM.",negative
"ndeed, reimbursements pose the main challenge to the administration of MEFM.",negative
"n terms of project design, the Evaluator recommended slight adjustments on the results matrix of the project in order to more accurately highlight the outcomes expected and ensure that the gender approach described in the project is measured.",negative
"The areas which require some improvements are those related to the implementation of the community plans and ensuring that proper responsibility and monitoring is conducted to track the plans. Based on focus group discussions, some communities highlighted that their expectations were not met and that they were not aligned with what IOM had intended to provide.",negative
the impact and change attributed to these efforts are harder to measure but further efforts should be taken by IOM to monitor these important activities in public information awareness.,negative
mprovements in planning were highlighted by several interviewees including recommendations to share the workplans with the resource management unit in the IOM office for better support.,negative
These changes were not however included in the results framework for the project. ,negative
"Similarly, within the MGI, limited questions relating to gender have been incorporated.",negative
Not including migration in the early stages raises the risk of not being included at all. ,negative
"Gender disaggregated information is not, thus far, being captured in all related indicators that are being defined for the SDG and END processes.",negative
"Still, these achievements fall below the average number of indicators (11) met by other UN Funds and Programmes entities.1",negative
"To build staff’s capacity to systematically conduct gender analysis and to guarantee sustainability to mainstream gender into programmatic work, will require more consistent resources and a dedicated strategy targeting staff involved in project management as well as Chiefs of Mission.",negative
mpact will be stronger with a better-resourced GCU and greater capacity to promote gender equality at the regional and country levels in both programming and staffing.,negative
"The policy has had a limited impact on IOM’s capacity to conduct assessments and to develop a capacity-building strategy, also with a view of guaranteeing sustainability of IOM efforts.",negative
Training does not reach enough people.,negative
"however, revision is suggested of the composition and role of WGGI and GFPs, as well as the accountability of senior staff, Heads of Missions with Regional Functions and Special Liaison Missions and Chiefs of Mission in contributing to the implementation.",negative
"The work done by IOM staff for mainstreaming gender should be better recognized, in particular for those contributing regularly to its implementation.",negative
"hat is certainly the case for the Sub-Programme, that advocates for the acceleration of societal changes in Resource Efficiency, Green Economy and Sustainable Production and Consumption. A strong science-policy interface alone does not solve this",negative
The results also do not capture changes that may have taken place beyond the environment sector or among multiple sectors.,negative
" the reported results are frequently2 ‘counts’ of deliverables, which are, from a national perspective, still close to outputs (e.g signing a common statement, forming a national alliance, workshops/conferences, issuing a national action plan or guidelines and running projects managed by international and UN agencies)3 .  there is no mechanism to evaluate the Sub-Programme’s impact.  the project constructs that are identified in the Project Information Management System (PIMS) do not accurately reflect the donor-funded projects that are implemented under that identity, although in theory the donor-funded or ‘sub- projects’ should be fully aligned with the Programme of Work.The results reflected in the logical frameworks of funded projects are frequently ‘retrofitted’ against the results frameworks of approved projects entered into the Project Information Management System.  the institution adopts a narrow definition of monitoring, which is limited to the six- monthly reporting against progress indicators (milestones) of projects identified in the Project Information Management System. This type of reporting does not capture sufficient in-depth understanding of the changes brought about by projects; and  there are two points of disconnection: the first between the funded project that is implemented and the project construct entered into the Project Information Management System and the second between the planned results of projects and the indicators of the Expected Accomplishments. However, it should be noted that for some PIMS projects, especially those that do not have sub-projects, the stated results show a closer alignment to the Expected Accomplishments.  the time necessary for countries to implement action plans and adopt related laws or bylaws can bring the results outside the project life and reporting period.",negative
"Results reporting falls short of providing the strategic global vision, yet required ‘counting’ monitoring often falls outside its direct agency. Substantive changes that may take place across multiple sectors of a country, or changes in the global discourse, appear difficult to track and therefore are not reported.",negative
though specific units of measure have been identified there is still possible overlap between indicators at a conceptual level. The further breakdown and single counting still does not allow for insight into the scale of the adoption of change or the implementation of agreed action. The new indicator set focusses more on the implementation phase (outcomes) as opposed to a mix of adoption and implementation in the old set.,negative
"However, more clarity around the operationalisation of this policy would be beneficial.",negative
"his change often materializes only after project closure. A connected issue is the tension between the normative role UN Environment Programme as a whole is designed to play, and the operational role it has in practice. Because of the normative focus, any substantive changes that are achieved in practice may go unreported.",negative
"Being mostly externally funded, the focus on fund acquisition fosters diversification but can hinder integration.",negative
"However, the Evaluation Office notes that UN Environment lacks a robust definition of ‘stakeholder’ resulting in different interpretations by different respondents and evaluators. The Evaluation Office also notes that projects across all sub-programmes have consistently performed relatively poorly under the criterion ‘project preparedness and readiness’8 . This criterion includes consideration of partner and stakeholder engagement in the period between project approval and mobilisation. The issue of stakeholder participations could be more closely associated with a weak demand-driven approach than during actual project implementation. Also from the regional perspective, the translation of global projects to regions and countries is not optimal and often ad-hoc",negative
Some of this is due to lengthy commenting processes and the need for extensive reworking of elements like Theory of Change and Logical Framework. Project Managers find this process to be incompatible with the proposal development and approval systems run by donors,negative

Failure to increase ordinary contributions will continue to compromise the effectiveness of PoW delivery including as a result of shortfalls in staffing.,negative
"The first was the question of prioritisation of activities as a means to limit the effects of funding shortfalls on PoW delivery. While simple prioritisation of activities would certainly guide allocation of MTF resources and fundraising activities in the short term, views remain polarised regarding the wider question of the scope of work and whether this should be tailored to available resource). The second was the question of how to improve the ratio between administrative and programme costs.",negative
There were no outcome indicators in the PoW logframe.,negative
.The Bureau raised two strategic issues in relation to the deficit that remain largely unresolved.,negative
"Mechanisms for gender mainstreaming have been put in place in some of the core areas of UNEPs work, but, these are not yet robust enough to ensure compliance and a meaningful integration of gender perspectives into operational or programmatic areas of work. The low level of resource allocation from core funds and external funds mobilization, low awareness level of staff regarding the GePA, insufficient commitment by management and staff to promote meaningful gender mainstreaming, and inadequate mechanisms for ensuring results suggest that gender mainstreaming in UNEP is not yet sustainable. The implementation of the GePA has been weakened by a number of constraints. Some of these weaknesses are strategic and can be traced back to the very core of the UNEP gender equality mandate and the strategy it has adopted to operationalize this mandate. Other weaknesses are more operational and relate more to institutional arrangements and implementing mechanisms adapted to support gender mainstreaming institutionally and operationally.",negative
Ensuring gender sensitivity of institutional processes alone does not guarantee the improvement of the quality of life of the disadvantaged or most vulnerable group of people. Without integrating specific interventions into programmes and projects to reduce or eliminate their vulnerabilities or to promote more equitable,negative
"The context is unclear: there is no statement as to how gender equality and equity should be understood in UNEP and how it applies to UNEP work. There is also no vision statement to create an institutional value and a sense of direction and opportunity for gender equality and equity. Gender mainstreaming strategy refers mainly to the institutional mechanisms in the four spheres (Policy, organizational, delivery and constituency)",negative
The GePA is not results-based and the gender mainstreaming actions are not linked to specific expected outcomes or results and to the operational priorities of UNEP.,negative
"gender equality has not been fully integrated into UNEP’s programmatic priorities: areas of focus for gender mainstreaming have been included in the respective strategy statement for each of the sub-programmes, but they are not reflected in the Expected Accomplishment (EAs) performance indicators and PoW output indicators.",negative
The review did not find sufficient evidence of proactive efforts from management to mobilize or allocate adequate funds for gender mainstreaming efforts. Extra-budgetary funds so far mobilized were inadequate to support full implementation of the GePA,negative
"ompared to other agencies (UN Habitat, UNDP and FAO), staffing for UNEP gender mainstreaming is too low. There is only a minimal Gender unit composed of just one Senior Gender Advisor (SGA) located in the Quality Assurance Section (QAS), Office of Operations. This limits the SGA’s visibility institution wide",negative
"Hence, many GFPs are inactive. The role of the SGA, gender coordinators and GFPs also need to be revisited.",negative
"owever, the limited perspective of gender mainstreaming in the GePA (focused on processes alone) reduces its relevance to bring forth gender equality development results in each of the Sub-programmes. By focusing gender mainstreaming mainly on institutional processes, the GePA does not fully support the gender equality objectives set in the GC decision.",negative
"In the few documents that feature gender, the focus is generally minimal.",negative
"But, increasing the proportions of female staff in P5 and D1 levels remains a challenge.",negative
"ensure that publications reflect gender perspectives wherever relevant. Consequently, there have been missed opportunities for gender to be reflected in some key publications.",negative
"However, gender has not been meaningfully ‘integrated’ into the project design; rather it is relegated to statements of political correctness made to ensure that PRC approval requirements are fulfilled4 . The review finds that gender mainstreaming in project implementation is weak because many project documents hardly feature gender aspects in activities’ planning and implementation, the monitoring policy does not have a gender perspective even though project managers are expected to report on the progress of project implementation as required in the Project Information and Management Systems (PIMs), there is no systematic monitoring and reporting of sex-disaggregated data or on gender-specific issues. Gender mainstreaming in evaluation has been weak because the evaluation policy does not have a gender perspective and the reference to gender aspects in the evaluation manual is minimal and insufficient to bring out learning on gender mainstreaming and demonstrating gender equality results and impacts",negative
"But, they are spread out without a mechanism to effectively consolidate and share, and therefore not easily accessible to UNEP staff.",negative
"ut, the role of UNEP in engaging with partners is unclear. The GePA has not consistently indicated expected outcomes and outputs of these partnerships. And, UNEP partnership policy has not defined the framework for engagement of partners on gender and environmental issues.",negative
"But, UNEP is having difficulty in successfully demonstrating its contribution to this endeavour. UNEP projects are unable to demonstrate their contribution to promoting gender equality mainly due to lack of substantive gender considerations in the project design and implementation, lack of sex-disaggregated and gender-specific information in monitoring and reporting, and lack of attention to gender dimensions in UNEP evaluations.",negative
The main reasons for this deficiency are inadequate policy review mechanisms and limited engagement of the SGA in the policy development process.,negative
"UNEP also needs to pay more attention to supporting career enhancement and life and work balance of staff, including focusing career enhancement training for women, enhancing induction package and referral systems provided by UNON, and improving the mechanism for implementation of harassment policy.",negative
hey also stated that ‘reporting lines in the new matrix approach are complex and staff members are yet to learn how to implement a single programme cutting across the six divisions’. The veracity of those findings remains undiminished.,negative
Sub-programme coordinators work across the Divisional structures but do not hold any authority over human or financial resources. It was always part of the design intent that the organisation should not create a ‘power base’ in the subprogrammes that would be at odds with the authority currently vested in Divisions Directors to avoid a situation where ‘power struggles’ or conflicts would impede smooth implementation of the PoW,negative
"Many staff involved in PoW preparation, including subprogramme coordinators, did not play any active role in the preparation of the MTS.",negative
"It is also unclear how baselines and targets have been determined and many baseline numbers are too ‘rounded’ to be credible. Furthermore, there is no clear link between POW Output targets and EA targets.",negative
"To add to the confusion, in some cases, related PoW Outputs are actually consecutive steps in a results chain, with one expected to lead to the other. It is fundamental to good RBM practice to avoid mixing different types of results at a single level in a results planning framework",negative
"This lack of authority can; impede SPCs from getting access to progress information from other divisions, limit their ability to influence project and programme design processes and constrain their influence on resource allocation decisions to pursue alignment with subprogramme priorities. Their ability to ensure that actions are taken to mitigate corporate risks to subprogramme implementation is also weak, especially when actions are required beyond the Lead Division. SPCs currently lack access to budgetary resources to perform coordination duties unless they happen to hold other substantive responsibilities that can afford them some flexibility in this regard.",negative
"resource allocations that are in-line with the priorities and interests of a Subprogramme, but that shift resources (staff and budget) away from the immediate control of a Division. Similar situations may prevail in relation to resource mobilisation priorities.",negative
"It would seem that the resource allocation trends associated with the former divisional structure prior to 2010 have been used to guide allocation of the Environment Fund. Relative priorities across thematic Subprogrammes, Expected Accomplishments and PoW Outputs are difficult to discern and lack any written justification. There is still a large amount of on-going work in UNEP that was initiated prior to the 2010-2011 PoW that has yet to be meaningfully linked to the organization’s higher level results. UNEP needs to phase out work initiated prior to the 2010-2011 PoW that has little meaningful linkage to the organization’s higher level results, and pursue a situation where all UNEP work has a strong connection to the results framework",negative
"From a resource mobilisation perspective, this presented a significant challenge because resources being mobilized by Divisions/Regional Offices are often for projects from previous biennia, some of which are not tightly linked to delivering outputs in the PoW. A number of staff are engaged in implementing these projects, which affects the alignment of staff time with the resource allocations in the PoW",negative
"here were serious time and resource constraints. QAS did provide project document templates and useful feedback on draft project design documents. QAS also facilitated an important project review process to raise quality at entry. However, there was no up-to-date programme manual to serve as a reference to project designers and training for staff involved in project design was found inadequate. These factors might all have contributed to the high heterogeneity in the quality of the project design documents reviewed by this evaluation.",negative
"In a few cases, milestones refer to external events which would have happened anyway. Few milestones captured processes and achievements ‘further along’ the intended causal pathways towards PoW Outputs and Expected Accomplishments. Improvements in the articulation of project milestones to better capture the intended project causality, coupled with monitoring of the achievement of project milestones scheduled in any given reporting period, would yield a robust and objectively verifiable reporting approach that would be easily incorporated into the approach used in current PPR process.",negative
It does seem that many projects have largely been designed within Divisions. If such synergies do exist they are not evident from the analysis of UNEP’s planning documents,negative
"Since the projects were designed separately, several indicators may exist for a given PoW Output and because these project-specific indicators often have different ‘metrics’ they do not offer a credible means of capturing the aggregate performance of all projects contributing to a PoW Output. In addition, a large proportion of PoW Outputs are defined at outcome level, therefore, there are temporal problems in using these indicators to monitor progress in programme implementation.",negative
inkages among UNEP divisions and activities are often weak with the role and contribution to the projects by units other than the lead one remaining unclear. The good practice of ensuring a ‘firewall’ between project supervision (oversight) and management is largely absent.,negative
ommon weakness is inadequate attention paid to the engagement of policy and decision-makers among stakeholders. A lack of detail in project documents on stakeholders often goes hand-in-hand with poorly articulated outreach and dissemination strategies. It is also important to note that project designs often articulate the intent to hire new staff for constituting the project management teams instead of relying on staff available in partner institutions.,negative
Gender aspects rarely feature in performance indicators or monitoring plans. The treatment of gender and South-South co-operation in project documents has been relegated to statements of political correctness made to ensure that project documents fulfill the PRC approval requirements in relation to these issue,negative
"At the time of project approval, a significant number of projects had mobilized none, or very small proportions, of the required project funds. The single most important deficiency is the absence of any quantification of Environment Fund financial or staff resources that will be required for project implementation. This deficiency is because the UN accounting systems (IMIS) cannot handle allocating Environment Fund (EF) resources to projects. The idea of allocating EF in projects was part of the original plan but had to be abandoned.",negative
"example, the expected outcome of UNEP assessment work is often policy change, however the intermediary steps and drivers needed to translate assessment results into policy changes are generally absent. Replication of project results is most often expected to happen simply through communication and awareness raising (websites, policy briefs, lessons learned papers etc.). Those activities are, in most cases, poorly spelled out and insufficiently resourced for replication to stand a good chance of success.",negative
"performance should happen independently of project management. Most project designs lack adequate baselines and very few specify activities to establish baselines and conduct recurrent monitoring. Milestones that capture progress to higher results levels are usually missing. Evaluation activities are often under-budgeted, and monitoring costs seldom appear in project budget",negative
It appears to have frequently been overlooked in the discrete project design processes that took place in the Divisions.,negative
The simultaneous introduction of results-oriented programming to the development of thematic subprogrammes that cut across the Divisional structure of the organisation added considerable complexity to work planning processes.,negative
The Evaluation Office finds that most of the Expected Accomplishments are pitched at a higher results level than direct outcomes1 and their achievement is beyond the exclusive control of UNEP.,negative
"SPCs report to the Director of their respective Lead Division. In the ‘matrix’ of Subprogrammes and Divisions, this may create ‘conflicts of Divisional and Subprogramme interest",negative
"There is a considerable amount of inconsistency in the current PoW terminology with internationally accepted definitions (OECD – DAC) and the definitions used by the UN Secretariat. Under the current PoW, Project level outcomes contribute to PoW output",negative
"econdly, with much of the Environment Fund used to fund staff, there is often little EF funding available to get projects off the ground.",negative
"Similar to the finding above, synergies among multiple projects contributing to one EA or PoW Output were not adequately described.",negative
"The narrative description and logframes presented in the project document frequently made no mention of the activities that were listed as CSFs. Sometimes, important risks were presented as Critical Success Factors (and vice versa).",negative
"Approved PoW projects lack adequate detail on the strategies to be employed to sustain project outcomes. Exit strategies are either ignored or implicit, and this is a serious shortcoming.",negative
It is evident from descriptions of project governance and management arrangements that the ‘Silos’ culture is still evident within UNEP.,negative
Analysis of stakeholder needs and how they may be affected by or contribute to the project is often weak or absent.,negative
How the private sector will be engaged often remains unclear.,negative
"However, the evaluation found that, in comparison to some other UN Agencies, UNEP struggles to fully embrace operating under One UN at the country level. The track record of relevance to United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) is inconsistent and is highly dependent on the individuals in regional offices and relationship with relevant government and UN counterparts (see recommendation 9).",negative
"but the regional delivery mechanisms are muted in the CCSP, and the artificial breakdown of the sub-regions (Africa, West Asia, etc.) does not serve the purpose of aligning UNEP’s strategy with some key ongoing collaborative efforts and initiatives based on trade and/or economics. For instance, in expanding use of better technologies one has to consider the underlying markets and trade patterns, which often are an ill match for the political boundaries of the UNEP Regions",negative
"There does not appear to be a clear approach on engagement with particular countries, nor a coherent strategy for identifying potential new partner countries, nor a great attention for possible synergies at the regional level. Countries are targeted by donors and aid agencies under their respective strategies and programmes of work (ADB, World Bank, EU, bilaterals, etc), and, therefore, even though requests come from the countries or regional offices, funding is only made available through a process of coordination between countries, UNEP and the respective donors. UNEP also seems cautious to work in countries or regions where it does not have a high potential to showcase positive results and/or have high visibility",negative
This is mostly true for interventions meant to test and demonstrate approaches as part of larger regional or global programmes. There is a risk there of conditions being less representative which may render the pilots less easy to replicate in less favourable conditio,negative
"However, many partner country interviewees were not aware which knowledge products and tools were developed specifically with the support of UNEP.",negative
"Both science and awareness/communication/dissemination are major elements in all CCSP PF documents, but strategic communications - a CCSP component and output, also part of the UNFCCC joint work programme - and awareness raising - an area of ‘distinctiveness’ - are not well defined and supported in CCSP implementation. Interviewees both across UNEP staff and in-country stakeholders have voiced concern over the lack of resources devoted to communication, dissemination, translation of reports, memos and publications into local languages to help ensure the materials reach intended audiences.",negative
"In addition, projects miss opportunities to reorient and better focus on achieving intended changes by not regularly incorporating assumptions and drivers into planning and implementation. Although assumptions are commonly listed in project document logframes as risks, corresponding mitigation strategies are not systematically proposed and/or utilized, and those employed are not recorded for purposes of learning, RBM or accountability. There is typically no risk management process or system in place for UNEP projects. Even though they are often factors the project implicitly seeks to influence, drivers are rarely explicitly stated",negative
"However, stakeholder involvement, especially at the country level, could be stronger during the design stage of projects. This is often limited due to budget constraints at the project design stage.",negative
are formulated at a level beyond which UNEP can be held accountable or UNEP actions would be readily attributable. These EAs are therefore not appropriate to monitor UNEP’s progress over the course of POW implementation.,negative
"example, the CCSP deliberately abandoned some smaller areas of work in order to streamline the programme of work. It has also meant working in fewer countries, concentrating efforts in countries where UNEP has a proven track record or previous relationships, and grouping related projects together within those countries. Other areas noted as important to UNEP’s corporate image and overall effectiveness according to strategy - but under-executed due to a lack of resources and incentives - were ensuring participatory project development, replication/scaling up of projects (exit strategies and follow-on plans for pilots), and risk management.",negative
"This was partly attributable to a lack of funds to design projects, resulting in a perpetual pattern of borrowing from existing projects to develop new ones.",negative
"but intermediary states between results levels were often not considered. Drivers were also largely absent from project design documents. Assumptions were presented in the form of risks, corresponding with the situation where the assumption would prove false",negative
"However, risks were often poorly formulated and projects rarely foresaw a mechanism to monitor risks.",negative
"According to QAS, many projects are submitted to PRC without 6-month milestones and targets for each indicator and QAS makes suggestions for milestones and targets which project managers are often expected to take up by the PRC.",negative
"coping exercises and assessments (sometimes at the global level) lead to consultations and further feasibility studies, usually early in implementation. On the whole, however, stakeholder analysis and capacity assessment in the design stages was often weak and infrequently used to better identify the respective capacities and define potential roles of specific direct and indirect intervention partners. This often amounted to missed opportunities to avoid particular risks and/or engage timely and strategic partners for targeted capacity building.",negative
Umbrella projects did not present a Theory of Change explaining the coherence between their sub-projects and sub-project results were difficult to identify and track for the purposes of learning and accountability. Managers have lost a measure of ownership and control over the ‘bundled’ projects and reporting and monitoring information for these entities is not meaningful at a programme or corporate level. Output milestones and targets developed for the umbrella projects were quite meaningless for monitoring progress at the level of the individual sub-projects. It has been decided in UNEP discourage the submission of umbrella projects from 2014 onwards.,negative
"he dual modality of normative and field activities may be a lot to ask of UNEP’s considerably limited country-based resources. In order to support the geographically dispersed efforts, when the CCSP was first launched, climate change experts were placed in each of the regional offices. However, to date, not all ROs retain these Regional CC Coordinators, and other Regional Office staff sometimes step in for CCSP coordination, with technical support from project staff. Notwithstanding significant challenges, UNEP’s competent and qualified staff have (long since) adapted to the lack of on-the-ground presence to the extent possible by leveraging partnerships and ensuring close communications with their government counterparts.",negative
"DTIE as the Lead Division makes the final budgetary decisions. There is a strong perception that DTIE abused its budget control to acquire a relatively larger amount of Environment Fund financing for its projects. The evaluation was unable to find evidence that this was really the case but this perception of unfairness creates mistrust and disincentives for collaboration. In addition, even though it is the CCSP Coordinating Division, DTIE has no authority over POW outputs other than mitigation [EA(b) and EA(c)] which makes overall coordination of the sub-programme very difficult from DTIE’s perspective.",negative
"hat is to say, there are too many different forms of accountability for programme delivery and a “lack of clear distinction between the ‘programmatic’ axis i.e. the responsibility for overseeing the achievement of the sub-programme objectives - the what - and the ‘implementation’ axis i.e. the responsibility for the day-to-day technical delivery of the programme - the how"". DTIE has the responsibility of coordination and allocation of funding for the CCSP but without an accountability mechanism. Staff report that they manage the lack of clear authority by knowing how to navigate the systems in place and meet administrative requirements. This has functioned for a few years for those staff that have remained in their respective roles/positions long enough to learn these options or gain some level of authority, but is not helpful to new staff and nor does it present a long-term solution.",negative

"RBM training has been provided to all Programme Officers since 2012, and staff indicate it has helped them better understand (and shape) the POW and MTS but it appears that RBM concepts have not yet been fully embraced. Some managers and staff see RBM as an external imposition rather than a management approach that supports meeting their key deliverables.",negative
"hey generate huge delays in recruitment that impact project and sub-programme performance. The CCSP as a whole is chronically stifled by staff shortages, largely due to vacancies that remain open due to the slow recruitment process. As many global programmes reach periods of expansion, so too will technical assistance demands increase as new countries begin implementation. Staff shortages mean UNEP cannot be in regular attendance at all key political meetings and is sometimes unable to embrace important opportunities to strategize or form collaborative relationships with new partners. Also, the lack of staff funded by reliable sources (both extra-budgetary funding and Environment Fund funding appear unreliable) has meant relatively high rates of fluctuation of team sizes and turnover in some units, many of whom have lost more than half their original number since 2010. These dramatic changes also impede retention of institutional knowledge.",negative
"ecuring funding from external donors is time intensive and does not typically guarantee continuity (e.g. donors can end funding at any time) and furthermore those projects that are fully funded from external sources (e.g. GEF) do not currently require reporting to the Sub-programme Coordinator under the POW. However, the relatively small amount of EF funding can also be unpredictable, as EF funds are only gradually released as donors make their contributions to UNEP. Often this means a sudden allocation of additional EF cash late in the year with a requirement to spend it quickly",negative
"In some cases, funding constraints made it impossible to conduct the planned field demonstrations and to provide follow-up after training courses. The prevalence of unsecured funds forced managers to take a phased implementation approach where activities would start at a smaller scale, while further funding was being mobilized. Underfunded projects can lead to higher than anticipated delays, and were sometimes absorbed into a larger project that also didn’t manage to secure large parts of its funding. For mitigation projects, unsecured funds also remain an issue even if they did not cause major blockages recently, with the exception of projects with several phases for which funds were not available in advance. Generally, this led to delays before the next phase could start causing a loss of momentum and bringing the risk to lose the gains achieved in the preceding phase",negative
"Since 2010, there is a standard format for project budgets, formulated around expenditure categories that are ‘inputs’ (e.g., staff salaries, travel, consultants, printing of publications, meeting room rental, computers, office rent, etc.). Project Documents hardly ever present budgets that are broken down to the output or activity level.",negative
"there is little evidence it has strengthened divisional linkages, and almost no indication that it has improved connections between sub-programmes. Furthermore, as more partnerships are in demand, within UNEP and the UN, but also with external partners, project teams have to devote additional time and energy to maintaining those relationships.",negative

"ut there are some opportunities that could be much further developed, such as CC adaptation and disaster risk reduction under the Disasters and Conflicts Sub-Programme, or CC mitigation and Resource Efficiency.",negative
"However, despite many good intentions presented in the POWs, Programme Framework documents and project documents, there is little evidence of effective formal collaboration between UNEP divisions related to the CCSP. According to the Mid-term Evaluation of the MTS and the survey for this evaluation, there was still room for improvement in communication and collaboration between Divisions and Regional Offices and in enabling Regional Offices to be more directly involved in the operations of the CCSP",negative
"his has to do with the fact that UNEP interventions are usually components or pilots of different projects, managed by different staff at the local level, in ROLAC and UNEP Nairobi. These projects have not been designed in a way that would promote collaboration at the national level. This often translates into missed opportunities that would increase the likelihood of impact of UNEP’s interventions.",negative
"This further diminishes UNEP’s already low regional/local presence and country-level coordination, and underutilizes the regional and country knowledge in the ROs.",negative
"The overall administrative burden, in particular the long lead-times to get contracts out, is an area of concern. Also, establishing durable relationships between UNEP and external partners is a challenge when based on a sequence of contracts or projects, rather than some longer-term MOU and a continuing funding base, since there is little institutional continuity or incentives to continue collaboration.",negative
"Regional offices make efforts to follow-up on the UNDAF preparation process but due to limited resources, they cannot participate in the UNDAF preparation of all the countries pertaining to the region and very often, the UNEP programming cycle does not match with that of the UNDAF.

"wever, the Project Documents of most projects designed for the biennium 2010/11 did not present even a basic M&E plan and often contained the same standard text on M&E, regardless of project specificities. Project design issues related to M&E included: ignored/unclear baselines, meaningless project milestones, issues with the project logical framework, lack of M&E budget etc. Most of the time, indicators were defined in the logical framework matrix included in the project document, but quite often they were not SMART2 and not monitored regularly in the course of project implementation.",negative
"Publicly available outputs (assessments, guidelines etc.) can be found online, but information on their utility and use is non-existent.

GEF-funded projects fared much better, as GEF rules regarding reporting and evaluation have been much more strictly applied in UNEP.",negative
"An ever present challenge is that much of UNEP’s CC work is ‘up front’ and relates to policy change or related measures. The causal chains may be tight and traceable, but it may take several years before policies translate into actual investment in better technologies, which is when increased resilience or reduction in GHG emissions relative to a baseline can be measured with some confidence and degree of accuracy. If/when impact occurs, projects are often long since completed in the official UNEP sense, and there is as yet no good way of tracking over longer periods of time the impacts of UNEP interventions or support.",negative
"e out of five 2012/13 EAs are pitched at an outcome level where UNEP cannot be held accountable for their achievements. UNEP can only provide the best possible products and services, target those to the most appropriate people in the most appropriate format. Attribution is a major issue and requires an evaluative approach. Those EAs are therefore not appropriate for monitoring UNEPs performance in the course of POW implementation. Most EAs incorporate the strategy or means (basically the outputs) by which UNEP intends to achieve or contribute to them. The indicators and units of measurement are then often indicating the delivery of these outputs rather than the extent to which the EA has been achieved. Other indicators are incomplete and do not indicate the full extent of achievement of the EA. It is unclear how baselines and targets have been determined and many baseline numbers are too “rounded” to be credible.",negative

"It is quite clear from interviews with staff that considerable pre-packaging of old activities to fit the Expected Accomplishments defined in the MTS occurred. The internal logic in the 2010-11 and 2012-13PoWs seem flawed in some respects. The current 2014-15PoW is not any easier to understand conceptually and the linkages to the higher level results are not altogether clear. EAs have been reformulated and there is considerable rearrangement of PoW Outputs under the three new EAs. In addition, there seems to be a lack of understanding among some staff on the thinking behind Sub-programme design and how their projects and interventions fit within the Sub-programme architecture and, for that matter, the UNEP PoW, because there was little to no participation by programme officers in Sub-programme design. In fact, over half of staff survey respondents reported not to have been involved in the process.",negative
ynergy and collaboration between the Chemicals and other DTIE Branches and UNEP divisions has been limited and takes place more on an ad hoc basis. There is lack of effective coordination and collaboration within the Branch and this is symptomatic of how it works generally within UNEP. There is obviously potential for synergy within the Sub-programme and with other related Sub-programmes but the “silo culture” within the Branch does not encourage broader collaboration.,negative
"For instance, in the past eleven years, there have been seven different heads of the Chemicals Branch with the current Chemicals Branch Director set to retire in the course of 2015. Similarly, IETC has had 3 branch heads in the period 2007 to 2014 and suffered from several periods with no branch head for example between 2007 and 2009 and between 2010 and 2011",negative
"ore recently, the C&W Sub-programme Coordinator position also remained vacant for a period of 7 months.",negative
"The Sub- programme has consistently identified the availability of funds to be a constraint in carrying out its capacity building activities. This has resulted in diminished capacity to implement some key secretariat functions such as the servicing of its information clearing house, preparations for major meetings and processing of QSP projects. The evaluation found that the C&W Sub-programme does not have a coherent resource mobilization strategy.",negative
"Reporting, especially at the Expected Accomplishment level, was not based on milestones and did not reflect progress being made by the Sub-programme towards EAs. Reporting at the project level was lax. Progress reports for individual projects especially on waste are not easily found and where they exist, the reports often described progress on activities and outputs only; higher level results are hardly ever reported on. Reporting on the Sub-programme through IMDIS remains biannual and undertaken on a routine basis.",negative
"Since 2010, quarterly progress reporting on projects in PIMS has also been undertaken against project milestones. Reporting is a shared responsibility between the project managers and the Sub-programme Coordinator. Programme Performance Reports, on the other hand, are coordinated by the Sub-programme Coordinator and are focused primarily on successes.",negative
"Milestones in most of the projects seemed adequate for measuring implementation progress. Resources, for the most part, are allocated for reporting and evaluation which seem adequate. However, project monitoring was not costed",negative
"owever the depth of the information in PIMS tends to vary from project to project. With little to no baseline information, poorly formulated Expected Accomplishment indicators, problems with attribution, and the lack of budgets for project monitoring, the task of monitoring accomplishments became a difficult one. Generally, the projects do not include baseline studies mainly because there is no funding for project design. The reports reviewed for this evaluation show that Sub-programme performance reporting is done mostly at the output level because output monitoring was an easier task and the achievement of outputs became a proxy for the achievement of EAs. Development of capacity at the national level, for example, often meant that training activities, workshops, seminars, meetings are organized and the successful completion of these meetings and workshops infer built capacity. The extent to which the workshops result in attitudinal changes that will lead to actions towards the sound management of chemicals is generally assumed.",negative
"Even obligatory completion reports of a reasonable quality have not been prepared for most completed projects. Very few, perhaps two, of the completed projects in the C&W Sub-programme were subjected to evaluation over the past 5 years. The two projects were actually GEF projects which over the previous MTS period were not considered part of the UNEP Programme of work. Interviews conducted in the Branch show a trend of lack of evaluation of programme activities dating farther back than the evaluation period. It is not unreasonable to state; therefore, that the culture of evaluation of programme activities is quite poor and needs to be improved. Monitoring at the project output level together with the lack of independent evaluative evidence make it impossible to make any meaningful judgments about progress made in implementation towards outcomes and impact.",negative
"n this regard, Chemicals Branch staff indicated that support from the Division of Communications and Public Information (DCPI) in the creation of public awareness on C&W and their sound management was inadequate.",negative
"As a result of the lack of funds to operate the information clearinghouse, however, alternative methods were used to disseminate technical and scientific information related to SAICM implementation.",negative
Lack of adequate resources for the provision of clearinghouse services as well as planning for regional meetings has been a challenge for SAICM.,negative
"As found in other Sub-programmes evaluated in UNEP, the processes for recruiting, procuring goods and services, and managing funds are quite bureaucratic and cumbersome, and have caused delays in programme delivery.",negative
"They are not ‘immediate outcomes’ as per the UN Secretariat definition and ‘out of reach’ of UNEP working alone. The gap between UNEP’s contribution and the high level defined for expected accomplishments limits the utility of the EG subprogram results framework for both monitoring and evaluation of UNEP’s performance. There is an inherent assumption embedded in the results framework indicators regarding environmental agreements that ‘more is better’ without reference to quality and substantive targeted results. This logic runs against a key observation, well understood within DELC and promoted to external audiences, that chaotic proliferation of environmental agreements and institutional arrangements has created obstacles to implementation with, among other issues, multiple reporting required of countries.",negative
"Prominent examples include ‘corporate’ work in communication (DCPI) and the regional representation function and implementation support at the regional level (DRC) both of which benefit the entire organisation. DRC’s work was included for the most part under EA(C) given its relations to UN country offices, yet this represented a small portion of its actual range of activity.",negative
The visibility of such corporate work both in terms of reporting performance and as a clear locus for resource allocations is also affected. Cross-cutting corporate support services should not reside within thematic sub-programmes.,negative
"This further undermines results-based design principles. For example, the DELC-managed ABC project was said to respond to 2010-11 PoW Outputs 411, 414 and 443. Yet, the connections with EA (A)’s PoW outputs was very indirec",negative
"For example within the HS & HW Sub- programme, the support to drafting an MEA on mercury, although not formally a part of the EGSP, was substantively supported by it. Such linkages, however, can lead to a lack of clarity on how to approach environmental governance in operational terms, as reflected by discussions between DELC, DEWA and DTIE over the lead role in black carbon activities. It can also lead to ‘double counting’ in reporting, where each subprogramme reports the same achievement. There is a clear need to better define roles and responsibilities for governance work where it overlaps with other thematically focused SPs (CC, EM, HS&HW, D&C and RE).",negative
"Most projects active within the Sub-programme during the 2010-13 MTS period were designed separately and implemented on a “stand-alone” basis with little consideration of the broader subpogramme context; many were inherited from previous programme cycles while others were underfunded. As a result, project alignment and overall cohesiveness of the EGSP portfolio was lacking, and potential links between projects and other SPs often remained unexplored.",negative
This has been a systemic constraint that is not limited to the EGSP. The articulation of regional priorities has been inconsistent and either lacking or poorly reflected in planning document,negative

The channels linking DELC as Lead Division to the Coordinating Divisions that are responsible for EA implementation were not well established",negative

"For example, while almost all of DEWA’s work for the 2010-2013 fell within the Environmental Governance EA (D), up to 50% of staff time was included under other SPs. In turn, many representation and coordination activities undertaken by DRC through its Regional Offices’ network (serving the entire PoW) were, for the most part, budgeted in terms of staff time within the EGSP",negative
Assessment of cost- effectiveness at higher programmatic levels is severely constrained by this. Initiatives by QAS to associate all subprogram staff costs with approved projects within the PoW will help clarify actual resource allocations; Sub-programme workplans should be routinely triangulated with Divisional workplans.,negative
"ub-programme Coordinators should be responsible for the coordination of design processes and monitoring of implementation progress at Sub-programme, Programme Framework and project levels. SP Coordinators also have little involvement in discussions with UNEP’s large donors or in resource allocation decisions. The end result has been a supply-side dynamic to budgeting that was largely ad hoc and dependent on the availability of funds for Division-implemented projects, rather than fostering of a shared strategic vision well aligned with SP priorities.",negative
"Since the SP Coordinator has no responsibility for, or authority over, work done in other Divisions he/she has to accept the both the timing, and to a large extent the quality, of the reporting information provided. The current monitoring system remains a self-assessment. Internal quality assurance processes to check the validity of data are limited. QAS does not have the capacity to assure validity and, like the SP coordinator, has limited authority / independence to verify, question or challenge reported progress",negative
"IMDIS and PPRs are acknowledged to have particular limitations in the amount of information that can be captured in them, which force staff to be selective in choosing which activities to include when reporting. This ad hoc selectivity, where a different set of activities may be reflected from one reporting period to the next, adds to inconsistencies in reporting progress.",negative
"progress only as far as project outputs, leaving a performance measurement gap between project outputs and performance at PoW/EA level trough project outcomes. Reporting at SP level is not based on any systematic collection of data, limiting the reporting system’s reliability and utility for gauging progress in implementation at levels ‘beyond’ project outputs.",negative
"The central role of countries is part of the UNEP vision, yet it is not clearly outlined and reflected in the UNEP subprogramme design and implementation arrangements.",negative
"EA(D) about “improved access to sound science” is a general approach that is better integrated across all UNEP interventions, although the work encompassed by EA(D) will move to the new subprogramme on ‘environment under review’ in the 2014-17 MTS period.",negative
This has led to a common perception among UNEP staff that the Environmental Governance SP had been used as a ‘parking lot’ for activities or functions that did not readily fit in other SPs.,negative
A tendency persists for Divisions to frame or ‘classify’ projects under certain EAs more because they are managed by that same Division than because of there are causal linkages inherent to the intervention that link to the EA.,negative
"Work that proceeds outside the project modality has a number of negative consequences for the systematic tracking of progress, reporting of results at project, EA and SP levels and evaluation of results.",negative
Sub-programme management (i.e.management processes that operate across the subprogramme) has been rather disjointed and has struggled to meet the needs of an inherently complex SP that has suffered from limited cohesiveness.,negative
"Above all, the absence clear assignations of responsibility / operational guidelines that work at the subprogramme level are a significant deficiency that affects the coherence of EGSP management.",negative
"The absence of programme dynamics and unresolved tension with Division-managed functions lowered EGSP momentum and the motivation of some participants, who perceive the subprogramme as a burdensome overlay to core Divisional responsibilities.",negative

"It is hard to see an overall programme logic emerging from the project documents, except in very broad terms. Causal or other linkages between programme components have not been thoroughly pondered and synergies and complementarities between the different components are poorly explained.

"ut UNEP cannot be everywhere. In truth, UNEP does not have formal criteria to select countries where more in‐depth and longer‐term intervention is justified and the first impression might be that “UNEP goes where the funding is”, that is that country choice is driven by donor interests rather than country needs or the UNEP mandat",negative
"More junior, well trained technical staff tend to be more volatile in that they are often attracted by better paid positions with international organisations operating in the country. Turn‐over of staff in international organisations is also a serious problem, because induction of new staff in complex post‐crisis country situations requires much time and effort, and cooperation with key international partners at the country level can really be affected by personal interests and relationship issues.",negative

"Cumbersome administrative regulations and processes have caused many delays in programme delivery, which sometimes affected the credibility of UNEP in the eyes of partners.",negative

"Consequently, there is a risk of overlap and duplication of efforts with other organisations, including other UN agencies.",negative
"Rather than addressing a specific environmental challenge, such as climate change, harmful substances or disasters and conflicts - ecosystem management is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Indeed, a significant amount of the work UNEP undertakes through its other subprogrammes is also based on, and promotes, the ecosystem approach, even if this is not explicitly stated.",negative
"PPRs ratings on EA delivery over the MTS 2010-2013 consistently indicate that the EMSP has performed less well than the other Subprogrammes since 2010. However, there are recognised weaknesses in the reporting and assessment systems and consequently direct comparison of performance across Subprogrammes (or even between projects) is questionable",negative

"Unfortunately, this project suffered particular challenges (especially lack of funding) and although corporate level communication efforts around EMSP projects were often strong, overall, communications of key EMSP messages and results has been poorly coordinated and not delivered effectively across the Subprogramme, and in general, communication has been a weak area of Subprogramme delivery.",negative
"This does not encourage and support dissemination, replication or catalysis of EMSP project results and presents a poor impression of UNEP.",negative
"However, it remains uncertain over how relevant, comprehensive and sustainable capacity development by the EMSP has been, and whether it was properly targeted at the most appropriate groups/individuals given the lack of any specific capacity development plan for the EMSP or individual projects. UNEP ROs had particular concerns about the need for national capacity to be built on long- term relationships and better coherence of UNEP’s ecosystem management work at country level, although this would necessitate greater in-country presence and increased investment of staff and resources at the RO level.",negative
"Efficiency has been affected by significant delays to some EMSP projects for a variety of external and internal reasons, which have inevitably meant higher staff and administrative costs.",negative
"While some projects have had specific strategies to disseminate technical outputs, in other instances it is unclear who should promote these knowledge products.",negative
"The lack of an overall EMSP strategy to ensure a coherent approach to capacity development has reduced the likelihood of institutional sustainability. In addition, sustainability is not considered to any significant extent in EMSP project documents which generally lack an ‘exit strategy’, and hand-over modalities to ensure continuity are usually unclear. Indeed, some projects in the portfolio are essentially ‘rolling projects’ with often a significant external demand (and expectation) for UNEP to continue a project if it has been successful",negative
"his may pose a risk to sustainability if the institution loses political support in the country, is restructured, or if key staff are transferred or leave. Even in the countries where UNEP has already provided intensive support, awareness and capacity for ecosystem management remains fragile and may need further strengthening for a considerable time to come. It is clear from the case studies that at least some EMSP projects will need continued investment and commitment from UNEP or partners for some years for project results to become sustainable, although it is often unclear how this would be achieved or who should be responsible (again a reflection of the lack of an exit strategy). Civil conflict and political instability has also compromised institutional sustainability of some elements of some projects within the EMSP",negative
"Also, judging from the case studies, some EMSP projects did not implement the governance structures envisaged in project documents (such as project steering committees), which has sometimes jeopardised the prospects for sustainability, particularly of local results, although there were exceptions, notably the TEEB. The lack of specific funding for stakeholder involvement at the project development phase also undermines ownership, and ultimately sustainability, and needs to be addressed by UNEP (see Recommendation 12 below).",negative
"Also, there was no overall replication strategy or approved communications plan for the Subprogramme as a whole (which could have been another source of added value at Subprogramme level). Although there are some encouraging signs of further interest, there is no evidence that replication to other countries has taken place to any significant extent. Despite the lack of a coherent, well-articulated strategy, the technical deliverables and demonstration activities under EA(b) combined with enabling work under EA(a) and EA(c) do provide a sound foundation (or strategy) for scaling up the EMSP results (less so replication)",negative
"risingly, there was little evidence of uptake of EMSP results by other UN agencies despite formal collaborative technical agreements/partnerships with some other UN agencies working on ecosystem management and the ecosystem approach, e.g. UNDP, UNESCO and FAO, and some UN agency interviewees were largely unaware of the EMSP or its results",negative
"Replication often takes place after a project has ended so would need to be measured at the Subprogramme level with resources established to track this. Indeed, replication and catalysis may be occurring more frequently than measured, but, since they are not being properly tracked, it is impossible to determine to what extent, unless a project is particularly visible or the project manager is active in follow-up",negative
"though the resulting Subprogramme can also be characterised as supply driven in the sense that it largely adopted approaches and themes on which UNEP had been working in previous biennia. As the ToC analysis showed, the Subprogramme design was weak with a confused causal logic and no ‘clear story line’. This has made it difficult to understand and communicate the EMSP both within UNEP and externally, and many of the Subprogramme’s other deficiencies arise from its initial design weaknesses.",negative
"he remaining project concepts seemed to have been implemented through several separate projects. However, the links between the remaining concepts and implemented projects were not always clear.",negative
While these are not necessarily unique to the EMSP they have affected delivery of the EMSP.,negative
"r example, roles and responsibilities of stakeholders and partners were often poorly identified, some projects appear to have been funded without a full project document, and complementarities with other relevant projects such as those delivering to the same PoW Output or same thematic area were rarely detailed.",negative
"ited consultation and planning with partners, stakeholders and ROs, has resulted in some projects being rather top-down in nature. There has also been no funding for establishing baselines against which subsequent progress and achievements could be measured. The ROs are vested with a responsibility to identify regional needs, but there is no specific budget for conducting needs assessments and it is unclear what current EMSP contributions to the ROs is actually intended to deliver. The evaluation also noted little or no awareness of the availability of (limited) project development funding amongst project managers (PMs) or for ROs",negative
"This shortfall in funding led to a need to downscale projects, with activities reduced or cancelled, particularly in the case of demonstration projects. This had repercussions on UNEP’s image among donors and stakeholders",negative
"n practice many of the more complex projects within the EMSP were designed over a longer period (typically four years) or have had to be extended. Projects need to develop supplements at the start of a new biennium and to realign the project to new PoW outputs. While useful from an adaptive management perspective, the repeated use of supplements can create ‘drift’ in project objectives and strategies and rolling results frameworks and budgets, which undermines accountability to the originally approved results and creates a tension between accountability and flexibility. Several of the case study projects are effectively operating in a programme mode with the final project bearing little resemblance to the original approved project. Whilst flexibility is clearly needed to accommodate emerging opportunities and earmarked funding for activities in accordance with UNEP’s mandate, there is a risk here that such projects grow in an opportunistic manner and skew the overall subprogramme delivery. This can sometimes undermine the rigour that a project modality is expected to bring in terms of accountability and RBM",negative
"New components added to approved ‘umbrella’ projects are not subject to the same level of scrutiny by PRC as entirely new projects even where, from the donor perspective, they are stand-alone projects. Their identity may be lost in a larger ‘umbrella’ project leading to loss of accountability to the donor-approved results. Similarly, whilst the work may be valuable and it may be relevant to the EMSP, accountability to the original expected results is sometimes lost. This is exacerbated by the limited ability to link expenditure to activitie",negative
"issues not being picked up quickly and opportunities for mutual support and learning between teams in the Subprogramme can be lost. Administrative regulations and procedures in UNEP are also not well adapted for field-based operations and have led to many delays and frustrations, which sometimes affected the credibility of UNEP in the eyes of partners.",negative
"Recurring issues include: i) the lead division centred nature of decision making; ii) limited authority of the SPC or lead Division over PoW outputs, projects or activities delegated to other accountable Divisions; iii) limited authority of the SPC that is not commensurate with responsibilities; iv) limited involvement of UNEP’s Regional Offices in programming and project delivery; and, v) predominance of a divisional culture over a one UNEP culture.",negative
"Some synergies and inter-linkages exist between certain projects but overall these are poor and staff still primarily identify with Divisions/Offices, Branches and Units and to some extent thematic areas, rather than with the EMSP and UNEP PoW. From the operational and management context, this indicates a weak Subprogramme identity and ownership, and the EMSP is essentially only regarded within a planning context.",negative
"Lesson learning is poor and inconsistent across the Subprogramme, with very little interaction and learning between the different projects in the EMSP and sharing expertise is weak to the point where some projects are operating as silos (reflecting an organizational level problem). Lesson learning has been further weakened by the failure to deliver a key EMSP-level learning project. There is no real format or process to capture and formalise lessons learned and more guidance is needed on this, including clarity over what the purpose of these lessons are and who is supposed to learn them.",negative
"At the same time, projects implemented in a particular country have sometimes been designed as separate interventions with few if any linkages, and there is little sense of a coherent portfolio of EMSP projects at country level. Interviewees emphasized that joint planning (including the ROs) both within the EMSP and with projects under other UNEP SPs would enable the EMSP to better respond to country needs, reduce overlaps and replication, and strengthen the overall Subprogramme structure.",negative
"Field activities and capacity building initiatives were reported to have been developed in a top-down manner at headquarters level with insufficient consultation with ROs, and little interaction with countries in establishing priorities, designing interventions and determining allocation of resources. This generated concerns regarding: i) failure to exploit ‘intelligence’ on country and regional situations gathered by the ROs; ii) inappropriate identification and selection of partners; iii) insufficient attention to continuity, sustainability, and mainstreaming, including through UNDAF processes; and iv) reduced visibility and coherence of the EMSP at country or regional level with a failure to capitalise on synergies with other UNEP work including GEF projects, with the risk of potential duplication or overlap of UNEP efforts at regional or country level",negative
the EMSP has no formal UNEP-wide advisory or coordination role in the area of ecosystem management. The evaluation also found limited evidence of linkage between EMSP projects where the potential for strong linkage and synergies would seem to exist such as in the area of ecosystem service valuation and economics projects.,negative
"However, motivation of staff delivering EMSP projects was undermined by the feeling of insufficient transparency in decision making in EMSP programming and particularly over resource allocation. Interviewees often mentioned that more training is needed, particularly on RBM, and that RO staff especially feel they have not received the same level of training opportunities as staff at UNEP headquarters",negative
"None of the case study projects had developed clear resource mobilisation strategies, and they adopted different approaches to resource mobilisation. The lack of a coherent Subprogramme story line that can be communicated to potential donors has also limited the opportunities for successful fund-raising",negative
"lso, there was some confusion among UNEP staff delivering EMSP projects on how extra-budgetary resources were allocated within the EMSP, and there was a general opinion among interviewees that resource allocation in the EMSP lacked transparency, and a demand for a more transparent and strategic process of allocation of Environment Fund, Trust Fund and Extra Budgetary funds. ROs in particular felt they are “down-stream” of resource allocation decision",negative
"Shortfalls in resource mobilisation particularly affected the first biennium, where many projects began without adequate funding and some with no funding at all. Whilst the evaluation was not able to assess budgets at PoW output level, some PoW outputs had no associated projects while others had as many as five contributing projects during both biennia, suggesting an unbalanced distribution of funding between PoW outputs.",negative
"However, the depth of partnerships as well as distribution of roles and responsibilities varied. There appears to be little awareness/visibility of the Subprogramme among partners, who mostly identify UNEP expertise and outputs with branches and their thematic areas. Again, this is partly due to the lack of coherence and a lack of a ‘clear story line’ to the Subprogramme, exacerbated by poorly coordinated communication of EMSP result",negative
"However, whilst project documents usually list stakeholders and partners, there were frequently no resources to consult many directly at the design stage, especially those at the site/local level. This has limited the ownership of project designs although local partnerships were usually developed at a later date once financing is secured. Also, the attention given to building strategic partnerships to promote dissemination, replication and up-scaling of the results of local demonstrations and pilots was sometimes insufficient.",negative

Similarly, it is difficult to specify policy outcomes in a results-based framework.",negative
"However, approval to engage with a private sector partner often takes a long time under UNEP’s due diligence process and can constrain private sector collaboration. Also, according to interviewees, the economic and financial crisis has made the private sector more cautious about investing in ‘unconventional’ or innovative approaches such as payment for ecosystem services and even the Green Economy concept. Consequently, engagement with the private sector by the EMSP has not been as extensive as was hoped. Linkage with the private sector (and to a certain extent academia) needs to be strategized for most EMSP projects and this should be an increased focus for future EMSP wor",negative
"However, there were a number of issues with the formulation and use of milestones that call their suitability into question. Of particular concern is that poor delivery on milestones is associated with a strong management response that emphasises accountability to results rather than learning",negative

In general, the roles and responsibilities of reporting focal points in relation to the roles and responsibilities of project managers and the SPC in the EMSP reporting cycle are not clear.",negative
"his limitation has been driven by accounting restrictions in PIMS although from a conceptual point of view a project may deliver against more than one EA and more than one PoW output. Other types of under-reporting include policy outcomes catalysed by projects but which are delivered after closure of the project, and projects extended into a new PoW biennium or MTS period whose reported results at project level may contribute to earlier outputs or EAs. While contributions of extended projects are currently captured at project level on PIMS, there is no mechanism to consolidate such contributions at the EMSP level once a given PoW period is completed.",negative

"This was caused by changes in government and overly optimistic assessments of the length of consultation and validation processes, as well as administrative and operative challenges.",negative
The lack of country presence implies that UN Environment staff is not directly involved in national policy processes and it needs collaboration with other agencies to stimulate change. This was done more effectively in some countries than in others.,negative

"The decision did not include a transparent analysis of underlying assumptions and preconditions that could have guided field offices; as a result, appropriate strategies, with clear indicators, operational milestones and roadmaps were not developed based on such analyses; and could not be used to support the review of progress in subsequent years. Furthermore, translating UNHCR’s mandate, and role, into more tangible standards or benchmarks proved challenging, and in the absence of strategies and roadmaps, offices came up with their own interpretations of the decision, and defined their own benchmarks and plans and processes for implementation. Where offices developed comprehensive phase down plans, there was no agreed, robust mechanism to monitor progress. Finally, the phase down was planned without the full buy-",negative
The extent to which reduction in overall expenditures was attributable to the 2013 decision cannot be calculated due to limited tracking of resources that went toward the phasing down process and of the unintended additional costs and liabilities it generated.,negative
"Nevertheless, when the 2013 decision was made, the intended outcomes were formulated only in terms of office structures and presences.",negative
"The available organizational planning guidance did not provide sufficient support to the offices on this issue, including on what standards for protection and assistance could be agreed with governments. In practice, most planning assumptions did not hold up.",negative
"By 2016, UNHCR was less able to carry out protection and solutions activities for persons of concern, directly and through partners. Refugees felt frustrated and abandoned, protection risks had increased, and phasing down left UNHCR less able to respond to new emergencies.",negative

"When the new urban refugee policy was introduced in 2009, the offices charged with its implementation did not receive dedicated resources for that purpose, nor were they provided with additional staff. At the same time, UNHCR’s regulations concerning local fund-raising have limited the extent to which the office has been able to take advantage of Malaysia’s prosperity and its potential for resource mobilization.",negative
"Even so, UNHCR’s recent experience in Malaysia highlights a number of the constraints that confront the organization in its efforts to implement the new urban refugee policy.",negative
"In Malaysia, such advocacy efforts have not yet succeeded in persuading the authorities to assume a more substantial role in relation to refugee issues, and UNHCR has consequently been obliged to assume responsibility for a wide variety of functions, including registration, status determination, documentation and detention monitoring, best interest determination for children, as well as assistance in the areas of health, education, livelihoods and the search for solutions.",negative

"However, as UNHCR was not prepared to deal with a major IDP crisis in DRC it was not able to respond in a timely way and to a scale commensurate with HCR’s status as a premier humanitarian organisation during a L3 displacement emergency. Due to a combination of internal and external factors, notably critical gaps in funding and staffing, protection monitoring did not influence delivery of services and assistance as planned. UNHCR was reviewing its approach in mid-2018 while being faced with the prospect of a December 2018 Page 4 low rate of return on their investments due to uncertainties about future funding after deactivation of the L3 emergency in April 201",negative

The interagency Protection Strategy of the Humanitarian Coordination Team (HCT) in DRC was approved in April 2018 following a prolonged process which meant there was no agreed protection strategy to guide the overall L3 response.,negative
"UNHCR in DRC did not wait for the declaration of the system-wide L3 emergency to start providing assistance, but they did so with limited resources in a context where the government did not authorise an initial assessment by the protection cluster.",negative
UNHCR’s response was widely viewed as inconsistent with the level of effort expected in a L3 displacement emergency and there was a lack of clarity about who in UNHCR HQ had overall accountability for this corporate response.,negative
There was a lack of systematic reporting of outcomes by UNHCR and most of their implementing partners during the period covered by the L3 declaration even though protection monitoring could have potentially provided outcome data for both advocacy initiatives and interventions at a community level.,negative
Significant delays in scaling up and gaps in systems and capacity compromised the effectiveness of the response.,negative
"UNHCR’s partner selection processes had unintended negative impacts on its interventions, particularly in Kasai where there were significant delays in identifying other partners after the PPA of one of their partners was not renewed.",negative

Moreover, the refugee and asylum seekers surveyed voiced significant confusion and misgivings regarding the RSD transition process, and the consequences of full assumption of responsibility for RSD by the Kenyan authorities.",negative
"Although the Work Plan has provided a comprehensive set of steps which should, once completed, provide for a timely conclusion of the transition process, it has not been possible to adhere to the foreseen timeframes.

"Overall, programming was not UNHCR’s strength in Turkey during the period under evaluation.",negative
"addition, the current disposition of field offices is no longer optimal given the changing footprint of assistance and coordination mechanisms. Finally, capacity development support to key non‐governmental partners has been limited to bolstering their ability to effectively deliver UNHCR programmes, and has not addressed the need to equip them to deliver essential services after the humanitarian phase is over and UNHCR shifts to a more strategic role.",negative

"More support should therefore have been provided, such as plastic sheeting for temporary roofing, which was by and large effective in Ethiopia. Shelters were constructed for Persons with Specific Needs (PSNs) – those deemed unable to construct for themselves – but the design was not sufficiently informed by consultation with the refugees.",negative
Very limited support for secondary education was provided. Coordination in the education sector was reported as weak in the first year by some partners who added that UNHCR’s education strategy was not well understood.,negative

"Partners’ ability to plan and develop strategies, however, was constrained by poorly coordinated and opaque decision-making, particularly around the Accountability 290 Matrixes, that are supposed to determine who does what where, which were a focus of discontent. High staff turnover and poor handover, particularly in some technical sectors, also negatively impacted UNHCR’s ability to effectively coordinate the response.",negative
"Protection considerations were partly integrated into the 300 response but some aspects remained weak in sectors such as site planning, shelter, food as well as health, nutrition, shelter and WASH at the transit centers.",negative
"The response was not based on protection assessments that would have been necessary to identify particular protection needs and risks, especially in a situation where the majority of refugees are women and children with a very high number of 310 unaccompanied and separated children.",negative
Coordination mechanisms were set up for specific protection areas and only merged into an overall protection working group at Gambella level towards the end of year one.,negative
but the scope and timeliness is uncertain due to the lack of data collection and documentation by UNHCR Gambella.,negative
"The child protection case management system remained weak due to lack of harmonization, coordination and capacities and only reached a portion of the children in need of specific protection interventions or at risk, including among UASC.",negative
"Coverage rates for nutrition programmes were extremely poor due to weak preventive measures, limited community involvement and a weak outreach system.",negative
"On the whole, however, food distribution in the transit centres was ad hoc.",negative

"nstead UNHCR invested in semi-permanent ‘tukul’ shelters in Leitchuor, which were later damaged or destroyed by flooding.",negative
"At the entry points, the limited availability of hangars provided for shelter meant that transit centres were overcrowded and some refugees went without shelter. The rate of the refugee influx, poor communication by UNHCR to partners on the timing or relocations, delays in plot demarcation and short-term shortages of some construction materials challenged the ability of the response effort to provide adequate emergency shelter on a timely basis. The progress of transitional shelter construction did not keep up with the rate of the refugee influx and UNHCR didn’t engage additional partners until the end of 2014, when 87% of the refugee population was still living in emergency shelter. 460 The availability of local materials, notably thatching grass, contributed to delays in permanent shelter construction. However, quality control of transitional shelters was inadequate and refugee participation in transitional shelter construction was low and variable.",negative
"There were, however, significant shortcomings.",negative
"The selection and retention of IPs and OPs however, was not transparent and not based on clear criteria.",negative
UNHCR operations in northern Uganda were scaling down at the time of the influx and there was no specific contingency planning or preparedness for the emergency that ensued.,negative
"The profile of the refugee population meant that there was a high burden on Reproductive Health (RH) services at all the health centres in Adjumani and Arua, although many pregnant 130 women still delivered at home and antenatal care was poor due to a weak community outreach system that refugee communities were not compelled to participate in.",negative
"Nutrition interventions were planned as an integrated component in the Ugandan health system that targets both the refugees and the host community, but there was no nutrition programme in the West Nile region prior to the onset of the crisis.",negative
"Hygiene promotion was not sufficiently focused, with too many messages and some inappropriate approaches for the context.",negative
"The size of the influx challenged the capacity of the partners to respond, particularly in Adjumani, resulting in emergency shelters being constructed in a rush, and not providing an adequate level of protection.",negative

Vulnerable group identification and prioritisation for food distribution was absent.,negative
"It has been difficult for UNHCR to decide how to prioritize its urban refugee programme, which currently serves in the region of 50,000 people, in a country where more than 350,000 refugees are to be found in overcrowded camps.",negative
"A particularly negative consequence of this situation is to be found in the length and inefficiency of the process whereby refugees register with UNHCR, have their status determined and are issued with refugee certificates.",negative

"However, the appropri- ateness support provided to the reintegration process in Burundi is of concern given the underestimation of the special conditions and needs of the 1972 group.",negative
"It is however suggested that if UNHCR had taken a regional approach instead of a “two country office approach”, there would have been a more appropriate and realistic assessment of the absorption capacity in Burundi at hand.",negative
"It was indicated that UNHCR has a top down approach rather than a partnership approach, and does not sufficiently value the skills and knowledge of the implementing partners.",negative
"In general, Burundian refugees appear to have had difficulties in reintegration and the 1972 group has faced particular problems, because of their length of absence. They had lost their right to land, whilst family and cultural ties had weakened. The complications of settling these returnees ap- pear to have been underestimated by UNHCR",negative
Pillar 2 is therefore likely to be completed at an unknown point in time.,negative

"Considering GFM brings in about 1,000 new vehicles each year, and that GFM will start disposal of GFM rental vehicles as of 2019, closing this gap is essential.",negative
Country operations have not yet put in place all the processes to effectively use the tracking system and its data.,negative
"GFM staff feel that this process is complex and time consuming and that not all revenues have been credited GFM budgets. Between 2015 and 2017, the difference between revenues collected by GFM and those credited to its account represented a loss of USD 9,883,785.",negative
"This was evident in the limited resources invested in managing the fleet and little ownership, especially at senior management level, of the importance of fleet management. As a result, there is no consistent staffing structure in place and not enough capacity to manage the fleet in-country.",negative
"n the six weeks preceding 25 June 2018, only 1,110 (19 percent) of the 5,694 vehicles in participating country operations had fuel entries, and 120 field offices located in the operations where FleetWave had been rolled out did not make any fuel entries. Data mileage and vehicle utilization is also not analyzed, in part because of lack of capacities in country operations, and as result are not used for planning and right-sizing the fleet.",negative
"Indeed, while the majority of UNHCR vehicles meet either the Euro 1 or 3 standard (i.e., polluting between 3 and 15 times more than the Euro 6 standard), greener vehicles manufactured for African and Asian markets are simply not available.",negative
GFM must follow a complex process whereby it must seek approval from UNHCR’s Programme Budget Service (PBS) to transfer the revenues it generates to its annual Operating Plan budget.,negative
Country operations have expressed concern about excessive lead time and double charges for vehicle rental.,negative
Another issue hampering the full functioning of GFM is that light vehicle management does not appear to be an operational priority for country operations.,negative

"Furthermore, differences of understanding can develop among all these actors because of the so-called “humanitarian dilemma”, namely differing attitudes on the part of those in a Cluster to working with UN peacekeeping operations and functioning within integrated missions.",negative
"This leadership has not been forthcoming in some situations, for example, the Haiti Earthquake response.",negative
"The presence of some 150 people in a coordination meeting of the Protection Cluster, as is the case in Haiti, is not a recipe for success.",negative
"On the other hand, as this study has shown, there are a range of issues that require the engagement of EXCOM in elaborating, in partnership with the High Commissioner, the details regarding how the Office can respond to this possible new commitment, including its financial, administrative and operational implications, without prejudice to its core mandate for refugee protection and assistance.",negative
"This was nevertheless a major challenge given the heavy demands on field teams, particularly in the early phase of the return movement.",negative
"but the majority of returnees, particularly in the Vanni, are currently living in temporary shelters which are not durable.",negative
"Significant gaps therefore persist in this sector, particularly for vulnerable returnee families, including many female headed households.",negative
"A comprehensive assessment of the situation in return areas was not possible, government restrictions on NGO access limited programming options, and the accelerated return process was initiated rapidly and with little advance warning.",negative
"The grant was negotiated directly with the government by UNHCR and led to tensions within the shelter cluster. In the absence of NGO partners, the capacity for monitoring by UN agencies has been limited given the vast area of return.",negative
"In particular, it was initially not clearly agreed with the government whether the grant would be limited to those IDPs displaced during the last conflict in the Vanni (from April 2008), or whether the ‘old’ IDP caseload would also be covered.",negative
"Around 100,000 IDPs remain in Menik Farm, and the area east of the A9 road had still not been cleared for return at the time of writing. Many of those who have ‘returned’ are still not in their home areas or if they are, have not yet returned to their own homes and land owing to the presence of mines, or, as in the case of Jaffna, because their homes lie in High Security Zones still not opened for return.",negative
"More than 200,000 IDPs displaced during earlier 5 phases of the conflict are also in need of durable solutions. These include more than 70,000 displaced from High Security Zones and 65,000 Muslims forcibly displaced from LTTE-held areas in the early 1990s and currently residing in Puttalam district in north- western Sri Lanka.",negative
"Nonetheless, significant gaps remain in a number of sectors.",negative
"The extent of shelter destruction appears to have been underestimated, 4 and the expectation that the majority of houses would be repairable using the grant provided has not been met.",negative
The grant was also not conceived under optimal conditions.,negative
This resulted in some difficulties in managing the implementation of the grant at field level.,negative
"However, an earlier focus on the sustainability of the project would have been advisable, and in some respects, the partnership with other Praesidium partners fell short of a collective joint vision and strategy.",negative
"Recent developments in Italy have shown that the effectiveness of such a mechanism is to a large extent determined by the extent to which it is situated within an enabling policy environment, which may be shaped by a range of factors largely independent of the model itself. Its effectiveness will be also be conditioned by the degree to which it is linked to a broader administrative and legislative framework which includes fair and transparent asylum procedures affording access to protection and the prospect of durable solutions.",negative
"UNHCR has expressed significant concerns about this policy shift, and at the time of the evaluation mission, the reception centre on Lampedusa was empty.",negative
"However, as already noted, the Praesidium approach is not a panacea.",negative
"Most of them consider that current conditions in Iraq prevent them from repatriating, while a significant number state that they have no intention of returning there under any circumstances.",negative
The question now looming over the operation is whether it will be possible to maintain the protection space that has been established in recent years if there are inadequate resources available to assist the refugees and to support the services on which they rely.,negative
"The task was also complicated by a number of additional factors, including its limited presence and standing in the Middle East, the absence of refugee laws and institutions in the countries of asylum, as well as their overriding preoccupation with other issues, including the Palestinian refugee question, national security and regional geopolitics.",negative
"First, the expansion of protection space has been based largely on understandings and agreements between UNHCR and the authorities which are yet to be institutionalized and which might be reversed if negative developments were to take place in the political, economic or security environments.",negative
A final concern derives from the very real prospect that the funding available to UNHCR and its partners will decline in the months and years to come.,negative
"barriers related to the one-year budget cycle (41 per cent), and situational analysis not adequately applied to intervention design (19 per cent). The five case studies confirm these results. The programmes inefficiently spend their limited time and resources on repetitive planning and reporting each year, including for the completion of the MC. The livelihood programmes have little assurance of resources from one year to the next, which limits their ability to do multi-year planning; this causes a sense of frustration among operations staff.",negative
"hough, the ET finds cash assistance provided through UNHCR could be better leveraged to intentionally build financial inclusion with PoC.",negative
"rom KIIs with UNHCR staff, the selection of partners with poor capacity is attributed to rushed selection due to the one-year cycle and the preference for traditional or known partners such as humanitarian NGOs as opposed to those with development expertise. The ET finds CO livelihood teams need guidance to select private sector and development partners and to expand operating partnerships",negative
One in five operations report that access to cash interventions or other assistance hinder PoC desire to participate in livelihoods. The ET finds there is a need for UNHCR to assess how dependence on humanitarian assistance (from UNHCR or partners) and its own messaging around vulnerability and durable solutions contribute to PoC willingness to engage in livelihoods.,negative
"The annual budget cycle, small budgets, and poor partner selection/capacity for many of the operations are key factors affecting the effectiveness, sustainability, and reach of interventions. The political, legal, security, environmental, and economic environments have a substantial effect on the ultimate achievement of refugee economic inclusion.",negative

"The capacity of the Branch Office, however, has not been commensurate with the challenges posed by the situation in the Canary Islands.",negative
"While all new arrivals receive information on their right to seek asylum, many do not adequately understand the information they receive and as a result do not exercise their rights.",negative
There are continued concerns with respect to the accuracy of the procedures used to determine the nationality of new arrivals.,negative
Access to the detention centres by CEAR lawyers is limited and as a result they do not make contact with all potential asylum seekers.,negative
"Unaccompanied minors in the Canary Islands are not adequately advised of their right to seek asylum, nor are there adequate procedures in place to identify asylum seekers among this population.",negative
"although little resettlement seems to follow those priorities. Either SUR is not actually sought, or there is disagreement over what it is and where it is likely to achieve the targeted results.",negative
e agency does not appear to have a common line on its presentation of SUR. This could be a result of the approach,negative
"metimes, their action (in terms of local integration, increasing protection space or keeping borders open) is a goal of SUR. However, involving them as full partners in the endeavour, rather than as targets of it, can be difficult, particularly if they view refugees as the responsibility of the international community, not of themselves",negative
"UNHCR’s emergency staffing roster was already heavily drawn upon for emergencies elsewhere in the world, a factor complicated by the need for at least some of the people on the ground to have a knowledge of Arabic.",negative
"In these circumstances, the organization was obliged to rely on many volunteers from other UNHCR operations in the region, as well external deployees.",negative
"UNHCR had to rely on the expertise of other agencies with mixed results. At times, the ratio between regular UNHCR staff members and external deployees was excessively skewed towards the latter.",negative
"Indeed, important restrictions continue to be placed on the rights of such persons, while both Egypt and Tunisia remain opposed to the local integration of refugees on their territory. The future of those who have not been able to find a solution by means of resettlement consequently remains unclear",negative
Sustaining this response did not prove easy.,negative
"In terms of material assistance, the lightweight emergency tents that were originally distributed to accommodate refugees and migrants in Tunisia were not suited to local conditions and quickly became unusable.",negative
"More generally, however, the evacuation and resettlement efforts undertaken by UNHCR and IOM do not appear to have expanded the protection space available to persons of concern in both countries.",negative
"In particular, during the first half of 2011, ARRA kept tight control over its role as implementing partner, limiting the opening up of humanitarian space to international agencies, despite lacking the resources and experience needed to scale up quickly to the unfolding emergency.",negative
"erational constraints such as reliance on cash payments in the absence of banks, complicated logistics, and a harsh environment in a very remote location constrained the response. Finally, telecommunications were limited with implications on communication and coordination functions.",negative
This meant that on an individual basis there were often gaps from the end of one cycle to the beginning of another.,negative
commodity in the food basket. The main reason given for low wheat grain consumption was a preference for other grains.,negative
"There was also a limited communications network hampering information flow. Improved preparedness and coherent contingency planning at all levels, promoted by more inclusive coordination mechanisms, and application of UNHCR new guidelines on “Strengthening UNHCR’s Emergency Policy and Procedures” were not in place until mid-2012; yet would have assisted in triggering an earlier response to the emergency.",negative
"Requests for additional funding were submitted to UNHCR HQ starting in late May 2011, two months after nutrition survey results depicting a series situation and after the entire current allocations had been exhausted. Very little additional funding for the emergency was received until July 2011.",negative
Greater humanitarian space for more international and technically competent partners and international recognition of the crisis was needed.,negative
"A number of respondents indicated that it appeared that the UNHCR offices were overwhelmed in the face of the emergency. In general, high staff turnover was highlighted creating problems in information management, partnership management and program implementation. Sourcing technical staff, in particular in the areas of nutrition and public health, presented a significant challenge. The UNHCR Country office requested additional staffing but those needs were not always met. It was noted that the Dollo Ado response was the first time a new emergency human resources policy of “2+6+1” was piloted - a scheme that provides human resources for 2 month initially (Emergency Response Teams), then 6 months (on Temporary Assignment), followed by a ‘fast tracked” year appointment. Some reservations were expressed about the calibre of those in the 6-month technical assistance role and formal review of this policy has not as of yet been completed. To further complicate matters, the recruitment of local capacity was also a challenge.",negative
"The magnitude of the numbers and severity of condition was overwhelming and capacity of agencies to cope was overstretched. Months after the response had fully activated, GAM rates remained above emergency thresholds and nutrition program performance indicators were below standard for all of 2011. In general there was poor coverage of programmes, low recovery rates, extended stays and high readmissions due in part to centralised services, poor community outreach and uncoordinated referral systems between implementing partners.",negative
"This made the coordination and effective implementation of programs very difficult. In addition, the fact that the different implementing partners apply different standards including the enrolment/discharge criteria for treatment programmes, key indicators and finally reporting formats, all of which further confounds the ability to consistently report, coordinate and plan within the nutrition and food sector.8",negative
"However, a major finding of the evaluation was failure in the adequacy and appropriateness of assistance provided at transit centres, in particular, food and nutrition, sanitation and shelter.",negative
Once the response began in earnest in July 2011 the correct interventions were employed but not to a sufficient scale and inconsistent in the quality of performance. This is seen when examining Sphere standard performance indicators of key sector interventions throughout 2011 and the extremely high rates of GAM in November 2011 that continued 5 months after the peak influx.,negative
The competing roles of ARRA presented a complexity to the response that was unique to the context.,negative
A centralised food distribution system compounded by limited capacity for most of 2011 resulted in distribution cycles that could take up to 2 to 3 weeks through the course of 2011.,negative
"With almost no livelihood opportunities or resource reserves, refugee households had a high dependence on food assistance to generate income.",negative
"irstly, from within the agency with the refugee mandate, there was a belief that UNHCR could, and should, handle the situation internally without requesting external support.",negative
The offices at both the Addis and Dollo levels were operating on a minimum of staff with little reserve capacity when the emergency arose.,negative
Around a third of the stakeholders interviewed felt that there was a lack of UNHCR leadership in particular in first half of the year when preparedness activities were lacking and the response was slow.,negative
"qually, the focus of the Addis Ababa level refugee Taskforce on information sharing rather than decision making, a lack of an Emergency Response Plan, and limited nationally based fundraising were all raised as issues impacting on the efficiency and effectiveness of the response.",negative
the disconnect between Addis and field level coordination efforts as well as visible turf struggles between UNHCR and some agencies. A,negative
"e Addis level, there was frustration over the weak content and inadequate management of the Refugee Taskforce meetings, as well as concerns over whether the necessary skills and competences were in place within key coordination positions.",negative
"At headquarters, there was poor situational analysis and a better need for systemic response mechanisms.",negative
"There were gaps in the coherence and coordination of the response. Overall, both at Dollo Ado and Addis Ababa level, UNHCR did not fulfil its coordination role adequately",negative
ecific guidance is lacking with respect to the organization’s role with asylum seekers who remain in the Refugee Status Determination procedure and who wish to participate in AVR programmes.,negative
"The review concludes that UNHCR lacks the capacity and expertise to monitor the social and economic reintegration of AVR participants in countries of origin, and that the organization should not seek to expand its activities in this domain.",negative
"n a context where the collective response appear to have had limited effects in halting on-going and even increasing levels of xenophobia and attacks on PoC, the evaluation concludes that UNHCR ROSA’s strategies, partnerships and supported programmes have not provided its PoC with effective and sustainable protection.",negative
"To that end, UNHCR ROSA needs a revised, relevant and coherent strategy developed following consultations with government, civil society, and independent analysts. Such a strategy should explicitly outline the overall objectives and indicators of success, mechanisms for securing government buy-in and guidelines which will inform the selection of programmes and partners receiving UNHCR support.",negative
"The lack of such a strategy leads to being more reactive and trying to do everything instead of prioritising and linking different actors given their competencies. This, as many respondents described, has led to UNHCR being spread “too thin.”",negative
This may have made sense early in the response but is now questionable given the increasing protection issues in Jordan.,negative
"This increase coincides with a near closure of the border to incoming refugees. Various well-informed respondents call for a broader strategy, one that uses different and well-placed stakeholders to advocate on behalf of the refugees with the Government of Jordan.",negative
"A quick-response is necessary to save lives yet it can also become the modus operandi of an operation. This is a prolonged crisis. The refugees’ needs are unlikely to decrease in the foreseeable future. UNHCR needs to develop a strategy that links with the Governments in Lebanon and Jordan, further facilitates the entry of other assistance and development actors (while maintaining UNHCR’s focus on refugees), and that seeks every opportunity for continuous improvement, efficiency, and cost effectiveness. It needs to do this given the common funding constraints that plague protracted humanitarian crises. It needs to do so given the complexities of Lebanon and Jordan’s status as middle-income countries, countries that are not typically prioritised for development funding and where the cost of delivering aid and other services is high. And, UNHCR needs to do all of this while maintaining a paramount focus on protection and assistance. This is high charge and this is why, as pointed out throughout this Evaluation, UNHCR must increase its focus, its use of strategy, its prioritisation, all while seeking every opportunity for other competent actors to take the lead.",negative
"Yet, UNHCR risks becoming a victim of its own success.",negative
"Finally, UNHCR country offices in Jordan and Lebanon lack fundamental tools and approaches for effective financial management, i.e. using monthly cash flow analysis to monitor, manage, and continuously improve operational performance. 3",negative
These and other issues point to a pattern of being reactive rather than strategic.,negative
"However PSEA governance, and staff and management responsibilities and accountabilities on PSEA are not yet as clear as they need to be to ensure effective mainstreaming. On a day- to-day basis, much of the responsibility for PSEA has been delegated to 300 PSEA Focal Points, representing less than 2 per cent of the agency’s total workforce.",negative
"this understanding is not currently translating on a consistent, day-to-day basis into the implementation of PSEA as a protection priority.",negative
"he capacity of its partner organisations on PSEA, or monitor the performance of both partners and vendors, is limited.",negative
"such dramatic shifts must be phased in over a longer timeframe, with more concerted support, including through resourcing, by the Executive Committee and senior management.",negative
"The AGDM Strategy does not have the weight of official UNHCR policy, nor has any clear vision been laid out that states what UNHCR will look like and be able to do once AGD mainstreaming is complete. UNHCR has relied too heavily on CDGECS in moving the AGDM Strategy forward; despite its best efforts, without adequate leadership and oversight by the Executive Committee and at the highest levels of UNHCR management - needed to guide and support mainstreaming at HQ and country operations levels",negative
"Nevertheless, the Executive Committee in particular has not fully met its responsibilities in ensuring adequate oversight and accountability, and that the AF fulfilled its planned purpose.",negative
"uch constraints to mainstreaming, in particular gender mainstreaming, are common in the UN; UNHCR now has the opportunity to build on new UN initiatives for mainstreaming, as well as progress made with its own AF.",negative
"but there is no higher level reporting, as would be expected under RBM.",negative
"They have also made numerous recommendations concerning how the AGDM Strategy and its PA methodology could be improved, and look to UNHCR to build a greater sense of shared ownership over AGDM and its tools.",negative
"UNHCR has limited capacity to ensure that these can be applied consistently and effectively by country operations. Operations struggling with deeply entrenched age, gender and cultural issues that translate into rights violations on a large scale in resource poor environments have not received the technical support or financial resources to put in place targeted actions on a scale required to resolve these issues. In practice, COs may have to choose to respond to the protection risks faced by one group over another.",negative
"At the same time, in no operation we are aware of, was it possible to ensure targeted actions that address the full range of protection gaps and heightened risks identified, as new protection gaps are emerging.",negative
"taff members are appraised on their objectives and provided that the objectives relate to AGDM, managers are able to appraise on staff members' AGDM capabilities. However, staff are assessed on aggregate rather than individual indicators. Because indicators related to AGD are included within a wider set of indicators, disaggregated data will not be available on AGD. UNHCR cannot therefore determine staff capacity or performance on AGDM through its Competency Framework. This will make it difficult to determine if UNHCR has an adequate staffing level to fulfill its current AGDM ACTION Plan, and also makes the development of the next Action Plan more challenging.",negative
The AGDM strategy was being viewed as an annual participatory assessment that comprised asking refugees what their needs and problems were.,negative
"The 2006 budget cuts, which affected both staffing levels and the resources available to put in place targeted actions, were persistently highlighted as having been a serious obstacle to following up on priorities identified during PAs and building trust with the community.",negative
"On the other hand, in many operations resources are extremely limited, and the unmet basic rights and needs are enormous.",negative
he lack of prioritization through the PA exercise has exacerbated this situation.,negative
"The evaluation team finds that the objectives set for this result of the AGDM ACTION Plan are somewhat contrary to the spirit and purpose of the AGDM Strategy as whole, and also raise fundamental questions about its coherence to date.",negative
It is difficult to align global standards of assistance with receptiveness to local diverse needs promoted by AGDM.,negative
"In many operations, staff described the challenge they face in defining appropriate priorities in line with the resource limitations.",negative
"Performance of FPCs was far more variable in determining strategic priorities and in developing work plans, which negatively impacted their ability to monitor their performance.",negative
"The evaluation found no explicit or consistent evidence of promotion of AAP by FPCs although protection actors, including UNHCR, had AAP mechanisms in place.",negative
"Where gaps have occurred, these have frequently been covered on an interim basis by UNHCR staff or by surge staff from standby rosters.",negative
reater direction from UNHCR would provide a stronger foundation.,negative
Collaboration with local NGOs and civil society groups is an area that UNHCR could strengthen and there is the potential for it to play a leadership role among peer CLAs in setting an agenda for transforming its engagement.,negative
"While PoLR exists at the conceptual level, the complex cluster architecture has caused confusion about how to operationalise these important responsibilities.",negative
AAP is frequently considered to be a seventh function of cluster coordination; it has also regularly been highlighted as one of the weakest components of the implementation of the TA.,negative
UNHCR has made mixed progress in its collaboration with core cluster partners.,negative
"From the perspective of effectiveness, one area that has received insufficient attention by UNHCR is its oversight of cluster performance.",negative
Changes identified in the protection provided to PoCs appeared principally to reflect national contextual factors rather than being clearly driven by the strategies.,negative
"Further, there was lack of clarity about the precise status and purpose of the strategies and their relationship to other strategic guidance.",negative
"The strategies also do not sufficiently acknowledge the different types of needs faced by persons of concern, and the implications of this for how strategies could be implemented.",negative
Guidance notes and tools provided limited guidance or support to country operations about how to generate data on indicators.,negative
. It is therefore difficult to ascertain the degree of influence of the Education Strategy on programming developed after its rollout.,negative
This reflects the fact that reporting does not take place against a consistent set of indicators directly related to strategy objectives either across countries or over time.,negative
It was clear from interviews and reviews of other information that major unresolved protection issues in the areas covered by the three strategies remained for PoCs in the five case study countries.,negative
It is however difficult to identify results and changes that can be clearly attributed at the country level to the strategies.,negative
The strategies are not based on clearly articulated assumptions or theories of change and insufficient guidance has been provided about how to interpret and implement them in very different operational contexts.,negative
The frameworks of objectives set out in the strategies are of varying degrees of precision and measurability.,negative
UNHCR Country Offices may lack the skills and resources to fully adapt and implement the strategies.,negative
"The COP process based around a single year budget with considerable uncertainty about, and fluctuations in, resource availability militates against coherent strategy planning and implementation.",negative
The strategies (and the supporting documentation and processes) may be seen as insufficiently prescriptive while also not providing sufficiently structured guidance on how to deal with the sorts of challenges that Country Offices in fact encounter.,negative
"while those of the Child Protection Framework are more broadly formulated, and the SGBV Strategy does not propose clear or measurable objectives.",negative
"The goals, objectives and action areas of the three strategies are embedded in UNHCR’s Results Framework only to a very limited extent.",negative
The comparison of the COPs for 2012 and 2016 for the five case study countries did not allow a conclusive assessment of progress because of a lack of consistency in the indicators reported.,negative
There are many areas in which international standards have not been met and the fragility of the settlements and the risks posed to refugees living there remain a concern.,negative
"Overcrowding and the lack of land is one major cause of unmet standards – the Kutupalong settlement has a population density twice that of Dhaka, often cited as one of the most densely populated cities. However, there are some areas where UNHCR and other agencies could have, and should have done better, such as the timely provision of locks and lighting, and building gender-separated toilets and bathing areas",negative
"Without formal authority, however, the accountability for the response has been and remains ambiguous.",negative
"Despite practical guidance, the data on the response indicates that protection issues have not always been prioritized by all the agencies in their delivery.",negative
"Nevertheless, a conducive and protective environment is far from established for the refugee population and could quite easily deteriorate given many negative external factors.",negative
"At the camp level, there is an inherent tension resultant from the different systems, processes and approaches used by UNHCR and IOM with geographic responsibilities in terms of coverage and delivery.",negative
"ese policy and process differences between UNHCR and IOM extend into the sectoral technical groups, which can find it difficult to reconcile competing standards.",negative
"Fundamentally, there is no clear accountability within the response, with no single entity in charge.",negative
"The organization has capitalized on the signing of the repatriation MoU to secure registration, but it has not progressed the links within the Government to the point where it is involved in providing advice on future policy options.",negative
"Thus far, there has been little movement on some form of limited right to work, education, access to justice and freedom of movement. These issues cannot be resolved at an operational level – there is a need for creative ideas to establish a dialogue of trust with policymakers. T",negative
t has done less with national authorities and has yet to properly engage civil society or local actors. The evaluation concludes that much work needs to be done with government and civil society partners in Bangladesh to develop greater understanding and build consensus.,negative
The anomalous coordination and leadership arrangements have not helped the response; at times there has also been fierce and unhelpful competition between IOM and UNHCR.,negative
"This has created confusion, efficiency losses, and tensions.",negative
"This evaluation demonstrates that there are consequences for people if the established UN architecture is not used, and also damage to the credibility of the UN and the humanitarian community. Humanitarian principles may even be compromised in such situations, even while recognizing the importance of sovereignty.",negative
"In the absence of law enforcement authorities in significant numbers, there is a perception of insecurity in the camps at night, and the lack of legal employment has reportedly forced some refugees into illegal exploitative laboursituations, or worse options such as drug trafficking and commercial sex work. People remain extremely worried about sexual assault in unlit parts of the camp, at night and when gathering firewood. On a policy level, the fear of forced return has driven some into hiding.",negative
This may require UNHCR to foster a role that goes beyond what it has envisioned from its accumulated experience.,negative
The complicated and ad hoc coordination and leadership arrangements have made decision making slower and more difficult.,negative
"n sum, the evaluation finds that UNHCR has not been able to fulfil its protection mandate in the way that might be expected.",negative
Where UNHCR has been much less effective is in navigating the politics of return.,negative
"On policy issues to enable social and economic inclusion of refugees in Bangladesh, UNHCR has not yet been able to move the needle.",negative
"Although alternative resettlement countries have been found for most of the rejected cases, this created an extra burden for UNHCR as well as delays for the concerned refugees.",negative
"Thus, in Timisoara, three UNHCR staff (with UNHCR or UNOPS contracts) work in the centre. In the Slovak Republic, the only UNHCR staff member manages the centre on a UNOPS contract. The difference in ETC-level staffing cannot be fully justified on the basis of their capacity. The above has also led to different budgets and variations in IP capacity, responsibilities and assistance, with the division of responsibilities between the different actors in Timisoara resulting in an overstretched IP with reduced capacity for counseling and other refugee-oriented activities.",negative
"n addition, the turnover of refugees has been slower than envisaged, with some refugees submitted to the US overstaying the maximum period of six months.",negative
"This can be partially attributed to outdated guidance notes and a gap between vision and practice, which has led to different views on the usage of these centres.",negative
his provision has been implemented in a manner that restricts freedom of movement of refugees as they are not permitted to leave the centre unless escorted by the implementing partner. This limitation is extremely frustrating for refugees and leads to a degree of institutionalization.,negative
"no freedom of movement, few opportunities for leisure and language training for adults, and a general sense of boredom. This has produced a living environment in which stress and tensions between individuals can more easily build up.",negative
The underutilization of the ETCs was regularly raised as a concern by interlocutors.,negative
"However, the planning documents for the ETCs do not allocate a specific number of spaces for emergency evacuations.",negative
Minimum standards for ETCs have not been developed.,negative
Yet not all resettlement staff are aware of the existence of these facilities or know how to use these centres.,negative
The major protection deficit noted by the evaluation team was the application of “limited freedom of movement” in Romania.,negative
"Providing opportunities for recovery and preparing for the integration process has only been achieved to some degree, depending on the situation in countries of asylum and the protection and assistance provided in the two centres.",negative
"However, the Project has a capable Project Management Unit team that has compensated for the weaknesses in its design and preparatory phase. Project reporting has been excellent, although monitoring and evaluation (M&E) has been challenging due to the number and complexity of indicators",positive

"These trainings promoted improved water utilization and management, use of better/more appropriate seed, improved agricultural techniques, improved cropping strategies and crop diversification. Use of improved and drought-tolerant seed together with crop diversification will decrease vulnerability to weather and climate change. Opportunity for investment, innovation and diversification has increased with better access to appropriate and reasonable credit.",positive

The ESFSP has been effective at consolidating and building on these disaster recovery initiatives to further develop sustainable livelihoods in the Delta region and dry zones of Myanmar.,positive
The programme also contributed to enhanced communications with the authorities and basic infrastructure development.,positive
The impact of the programme in the Delta region was almost certainly enhanced through synergies and threshold effects related to the input received from a wide range of organizations following Cyclone Nargis.,positive
"FMM procedures have progressed through a number of stages over a period of about ten years, including several predecessor schemes. While this has enabled a degree of flexibility,",positive
FMM is also being used strategically in providing bridging funds between phases of programmes and amplifying the achievements of projects funded from other sources. Projects are mostly well aligned with national priorities and have helped to build partnerships and develop capacity in national institutions,positive
"Other positive aspects of FMM include its ability to create synergies with other FAO programmes and projects, as well as those supported by other development partners, governments and civil society organisations. Furthermore, a number of FMM-supported initiatives have been quite innovative, involving strong leadership from HQ technical departments.",positive

The FFF approach is highly aligned with the national policies of participating countries.,positive
"The main factors of sustainability of the FFF concept include the high political and social ownership of the FFF model, and the social and economic incentives it offers to target FFPOs.",positive
"The focus and logic are aligned with FAO’s strategic objectives SO2 and SO3. The project design is appropriate for achieving its outcomes and vision, and it addresses challenges such as the limited ability of forest and farm smallholders to access markets, participate in value chains and engage in policy processes.",positive
FFF was effective in linking FFPOs to markets and engaging in policy dialogue. FFF also contributed to raising the awareness of forest and farm smallholders on the multiple advantages of working together.,positive

"Capacity development efforts to date have achieved the final draft of the CIP, which has been finalized and approved.",positive
Relations between the project and with various departments and agencies within the ministry are strong but need to be continually monitored to ensure equality.,positive
"The capacity development activities undertaken to date have resulted in the development and finalization of the CIP, the development of monitoring tools and processes and the deepening of functional and technical capacities around the development of an investment programme within the Ministry of Environment and Forests and its Agencies.",positive
"The programme approach allowed IGGHRP to create synergies between FAO internally and the EU development agenda. The breadth and flexibility of the programme approach combined with a strong core management team allowed it to reach across sectors and unite people who did not usually work together focusing on food, nutrition and agriculture issues",positive
"Adaptive management was helpful for allowing FAO and EU to deliver a more comprehensive approach to address FSN issues. By applying adaptive management, the programme design was able to evolve over time as new opportunities presented themselves. IGGHR programme staff used flexible programme resources to pilot innovative approaches (e.g. Women’s Dietary Diversity Indicator, the Nutrition–Sensitive Agriculture Investments Checklist, CoOPEquity, and other innovative community based models), to provide bridge funding at strategic moments in potentially high impact initiatives when other funding was delayed (e.g. IPC, VGGTs) or uncertain (e.g. CFS), to provide funding for scaling up high impact initiatives (e.g. LEGS, IPC, E-learning, ADePT), and to provide investment to leverage other resources internally or external to FAO (e.g. Investment Centre, CFS, VGGTs, POs, and E-learning).",positive
"Within FAO, in 2013, the programme was able to strategically align itself and contributed to the new strategic thinking within FAO. For example, the IGGHRP was one of the first programmes to align its efforts to the new FAO strategic framework around the five new SOs and the EU/DEVCO C1 (Rural Development, Food Security and Nutrition) four Strategic Priorities. The programme was also able to support the social protection and smallholder agriculture research that ESA was carrying out, which was a key niche for FAO to fill in the social protection arena.",positive
"Taking advantage of the renewed global concern for nutrition being promoted through the SUN initiative, the programme was able to use its resources to strengthen its work on nutrition and agriculture. The programme also was able to capitalise on donor interest in improving FSN measurement in national surveys.",positive
"he Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (VGGTs) and Framework for Action for Food Security and Nutrition in Protracted Crises (CFS-FFA) exemplify how the CFS can influence governance. While the impact of the CFS on global governance is not easily assessed, monitoring CFS policy implementation in the future as a CFS work stream should provide the needed evidence base. The Civil Society Mechanism (CSM) has thus provided an essential voice of rights holders in the deliberations of the CFS, but in general, more field level input should be encouraged.",positive
"earning has reached many users and is generally well received, and in some cases, as evidenced at AGHRYMET, a systematic capacity plan was developed at the start of IGGHRP investment. Several country level capacity assessments and follow up capacity development plans have also been implemented. The IGGHRP-funded work to build country level capacity to integrate nutrition into CAADP-related plans was successfu",positive
"ols highlighted in interviews and have been widely adopted by multiple agencies and scaled up include IPC, the Nutrition- Sensitive Agriculture Investments Checklist, LEGS, and VGGTs. A number of other products have real promise for scaling up, including MDD-W, ADePT and MOSAICC. The Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA) approach for measuring resilience also is being tested in multiple countries.",positive
Efforts supported by the programme included a review and development of improved methods for collecting consumption data in household budget surveys; revision of the methodology for compilation of the Prevalence of Undernourishment and a new suite of food security indicators; strengthening of countries’ capacity to produce and analyse food insecurity indicators using ADePT software.,positive
"The IGGHRP created novel interactions among HQ SO teams and divisions at the HQ level that can be attributed to the programme. At HQ, the programme strengthened linkages between FAO’s normative and operational work and encouraged interdisciplinary work between divisions bringing together different FAO divisions that normally did not work together.",positive
The programme developed creative approaches to gender mainstreaming within FAO. The CoOPEquity initiative was a particularly successful aspect of mainstreaming gender in FAO’s work with Producer Organisations.,positive
"he IGGHRP enabled FAO to strengthen its position in global, regional and national nutrition-related governance forums. At the regional level, the programme led the integration of nutrition in National Agriculture Sector Investment Plans in the CAADP process in Africa and linking SUN Nutrition Multi-sectoral process to national policies5. At the country level, IGGHRP tools are being used to improve the evidence base for nutrition in agriculture, and IGGHR programme tools are widely used (e.g. nutrition sensitive agriculture investments checklist). The programme enabled FAO to participate as a substantive partner in key international forums, such as the ICN2, SUN and REACH, and to ensure implementation of these initiatives in some of its focus countries.",positive
"At the beginning of the programme, partnership between IGGHRP and EU was affected by EU staff turnover. The IGGHRP made efforts to improve collaboration and establish regular dialogue, and communication has improved over tim",positive
"The IGGHRP demonstrated the utility of integration for achieving policy results, especially vertical and horizontal linkages across FAO. Only 11 out of 19 countries targeted by INFORMED will overlap with FIRST, separating information from policy decision making.",positive
"Since the MTE, the IGGHRP also developed a series of briefs describing the programme’s achievements, which were well received by the EU, as well as an inventory of tools, methodologies and guidance, which is published on the FAO-EU partnership website.",positive
Programme achievements and funding have further catalysed external funding and support. The ET was very impressed at how resources were leveraged to secure additional funding and support from other sources.,positive
"Overall, the ET concluded that this was a very successful programme and accomplished a great deal in four years.",positive
Flexibility and adaptive management of the IGGHR programme allowed FAO to seize upon a number of strategic opportunities that emerged both within and outside of FAO.,positive
Another external strategic opportunity that the IGGHRP was able to seize upon in 2012- 13 was global and EU demand to engage in resilience programming and measurement.,positive
"Through the FSIN work, the IGGHRP also was effective in harmonizing price data streams and building consensus on principles and concepts underpinning resilience measurement.",positive
he programme was exemplary in the extent to which nutrition was mainstreamed and internalised within FAO and extended into major international nutrition forums.,positive
The programme has contributed to mainstreaming good governance in terms of types of policies supported and institutional capacity development.,positive
"The budget was allocated properly, with 46 percent of the budget allocated to capacity building while 70 percent focused on country and regional-level activities. Funds not spent were carried forward each year.",positive
t is playing a catalytic role in increasing stakeholders’ awareness and contributions to the overall objectives. It is also playing a vital role as an integrating platform for various complementary and synergistic initiatives to achieve greater impact and efficiency.,positive
"The process of SPARS development, including the IdCA and involving the NSOs and ministries of agriculture, built ownership as well as country capacity.1",positive
"At the time of the MTE, the implementation of activities carried out by the Global, Africa and Asia-Pacific Regional Offices did not experience funding shortfalls.",positive
Funds were managed and administered prudently.,positive
"The Global Strategy has given appropriate consideration to gender equality. Although the gender ratio varies significantly (in terms of proportion of women to men in the various bodies of the Global Strategy), the overall degree of inclusiveness was acknowledged by all stakeholder",positive
Governance structures have proven to be useful platforms for coordination and facilitation among the different partners.,positive
"In terms of outcome- level results, the project has considerably increased the scientific and economic knowledge and understanding about issues related to GWG, particularly among the technical groundwater community. The FFA lays out a very broad scope for future action",positive
"Through this work, the project has produced a credible, scientific basis for GWG. Stakeholders interviewed expressed satisfaction with the quality of the documents produced during the first years of the project.",positive
Expanding the reports’ messages to a larger audience in this way could eventually increase political support for GWG at the national and international levels.,positive
"mportant indications of the project’s impact include the speed with which FFA principles were integrated into PSC agencies’ work, and the increase of the agencies’ activities in GWG.",positive
"Almost all of the output level results have been achieved, including production of the Global Diagnostic, the Vision and the Global Framework for Action.",positive
Interviewed stakeholders expressed strong satisfaction with the work in groundwater management and governance.,positive
"During the first few years of the project, a number of technical documents were produced which considerably expanded the existing knowledge base on groundwater management and governance at both regional and global levels.",positive
The limited success at the political level did not deter partners from using key messages in the reports to support their own work in GWG.,positive
"The partnership among participating agencies was an important achievement, which should serve as the basis for further collaborative work on GWG while addressing the shortcomings of the present project phase.",positive
"Work was completed on 45 research topics and 16 research themes. A total of 119 documents, including guidelines, handbooks and training materials, were produced",positive
"79 emerging agricultural statisticians in 40 countries benefitted from scholarship initiatives. Statistical institutes in Africa have been strengthened to provide training and technical assistance. Although there was evidence of increased knowledge and skills, evidence of institutionalization and use of capacity to produce data was still nascent",positive
"On a practical level, it has been instrumental in integrating agricultural and rural statistics systems into national statistical systems.",positive
Global Strategy met or exceeded the intended outputs of its research component.,positive
"Global Strategy has raised the profile of agricultural and rural statistics globally, especially in Africa and Asia-Pacific.",positive
"he drive for UN normative values of gender equality and, in particular, youth and female empowerment, Global Strategy has proven effective with higher participation of both groups than numbers currently working in the sector.",positive
"his, combined with the systematic structured IPC analysis process, gives it both authority and credibility. As a global international standard it can be used to make comparisons over space and time",positive
"he more frequently the AFI is carried out, the more likely it is to be used and to meet decision makers’ needs, for example in countries with protracted crises where the AFI is carried out more than once a year.",positive
"t demonstrates high adaptive capacity, for example in the participative process of drafting Manual v3.0.",positive
The GSU has skilfully managed the many and varied demands on it.,positive
he online survey results showed higher satisfaction levels with the AFI in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Asia and Latin America.,positive
"The growing influence of the AFI has encouraged investment in data collection in some countries, e.g. South Sudan",positive
"The GSP, and GSU in particular, has developed a culture of reflection and learning.",positive
"The de facto selection of i) food security and nutrition, ii) resilience and relief; and iii) employment as anchor themes for the ASTF is of high relevance: they encompass the main challenges currently faced by rural Africa.",positive
"In particular, contributions to institutional as well as individual capacity building were noted.",positive
"This is particularly the case for the Ebola projects in West Africa and the employment projects in East Africa. Similarly, the knowledge and capacities transferred, for example in the case of the sanitary and phytosanitary project in southern Africa, have been institutionalized at the national and regional levels and can be continued through the recently signed project with the European Union as well as via governments’ initiative",positive
"However, some projects made additional efforts to cater to female beneficiaries during the implementation phase.",positive
The ASTF has been one of the most important sources of extrabudgetary funding for FAO’s work in Africa.,positive
"Overall, end users and experts have a positive opinion of (and high expectations for) the quality of FAO databases and publications. This positive assessment should serve as an incentive to both strengthen and consistently apply quality assurance mechanisms for all knowledge products and services.",positive
FAO knowledge products and services are widely recognized for their technical excellence.,positive
"FAO knowledge products and services have contributed to enhancing technical knowledge and analyses, and strengthening the evidence base for policies and programmes.",positive
"This support was generally provided in an efficient and timely manner, and was of good quality.",positive
"However, the programme implemented pilot projects in suitable countries which are usually a precursor to changes in operational frameworks. The two pilot projects in Uganda have demonstrated that FAO can provide support for the implementation of the laws and policies, in this case on customary land and forest rights. These pilot projects gave very concrete benefits to the Ugandan people and were an effective use of funds.",positive
The motivation and confidence shown by civil society was impressive and civil society was made to feel empowered.,positive
The result was the formation of a highly motivated group of stakeholders that could engage with both the community and the government.,positive
"These initiatives developed capacities while also building motivation, empowerment, partnerships and sustainability.",positive
The evaluation team found evidence of good collaboration throughout FAO to support the programme.,positive
The programme team has been very effective in coordinating country support with the different technical units within FAO.,positive
"In the countries included in the first phase, the focus was logically on the national level.",positive
"Thanks to the Decade, nutrition is for the first time a standing item for discussion every two years at the UN General Assembly. FAO and WHO were mandated to lead with the implementation of the Decade and to develop a work programme for the Nutrition Decade in collaboration with other UN Agencies. FAO was also successful in hosting and relaunching the UNSCN at FAO headquarters, providing mutual benefits and access to a wide range of food system experts.",positive
"Significant work on governance has taken place in Latin America on school meal programmes, food systems and obesity prevention, in Asia through the promotion of crop and diet diversity, and in Africa within the context of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) and the Malabo Declaration, with some promising effects. FAO has helped to strengthen countries’ capacity for mainstreaming nutrition in their national agriculture and food security investment plans. There has also been a wide array of interesting capacity building projects implemented since the Strategy was promulgated",positive
"This sequence of achievements at global level was followed by the International Symposium on Sustainable Food Systems for Healthy Diets and Improved Nutrition in 2016 and subsequent five similar regional symposiums held during 2017 to promote food-based approaches to addressing malnutrition and advocate for a stronger integration of nutrition in agriculture. The symposiums both at global and regional levels brought together the resources of different levels of the Organization, with excellent collaboration between ESN, Regional Offices and the Office for Corporate Communication (OCC), to help operationalize the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition.",positive
"The field programme related to nutrition has more than doubled since the promulgation of the Strategy, and has evolved towards more deliberate efforts to address all forms of malnutrition. There also has been a surge in the development of knowledge products and in the number of events attended. From a relatively low base, the Organization has built a more visible presence in this domain and has brought to bear significant analytical strengths to document and advocate for food-based approaches to nutrition. Nutrition was introduced as a cross-cutting theme in the FAO Strategic Framework and has started to be mainstreamed in the work of all Strategic Programmes.",positive
"ICN2 was a seminal moment, which has started to shape FAO’s Nutrition Agenda. The adoption of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition by the United Nations General Assembly in April 2016, with its work programme co-lead by FAO and WHO, provides a strong platform for political engagement.",positive
"t has the mandate and the global, regional and national reach required to lead the way in piloting food-based approaches to nutrition, including access to CFS and UNSCN. It can rely on significant strengths: a long experience in the relevant technical sectors, the right tools and indicators, highly motivated teams, and relations in general good standing with all relevant partner institutions including resource partners.",positive
he mainstreaming of nutrition into the FAO Strategic Framework and structural changes in the Nutrition Division were fully implemented.,positive
"Clearly, the Second International Conference on Nutrition convened in Rome from 19 to 21 November 2014 by FAO and WHO was by all account a resounding success.",positive
"AO has further promoted the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition 2016-2025, as well as supported the development of the 2030 Agenda and informing the tracking of SDG2 targets.",positive
Modest progress has been achieved in evidence building at country level.,positive
Regional economic communities and groups as well as regional parliamentary forums were found useful entry points for policy support and advocacy.,positive
"There is now considerable global attention being paid to the need to advance food-based approaches in order to effectively tackle the global burden of malnutrition, inside and outside FAO.",positive
"t has also effectively “broken down silos”, notably through its weekly teleconferences and its country support process. These processes and supportive attitude make of Strategic Programme 5 one of the most present and visible Strategic Programmes at country level.",positive
"Some Regional Initiatives have generated collaboration between Strategic Programmes. At country level, the Strategic Programmes are seamlessly brought together under the country programming frameworks.",positive
"owever, encouraging examples exist of comprehensive and potentially useful policy support by FAO in disaster risk reduction and management.",positive
A number of country offices have drafted resilience strategies as a way to address this gap.,positive
"At the country level, FAO has broadened its collaboration with ministries and departments beyond the ‘traditional’ FAO governmental counterparts, e.g. with Ministries of Environment, and FAO often assumes a coordinating role in its areas of expertise.",positive
"uidance on these issues has been produced and disseminated, and programme design has afforded greater consideration to gender integration and AAP.",positive
"divide fits well with FAO’s mandate and its long engagement in both development and emergency contexts to support agricultural livelihoods. Specifically, the Organization’s experience in early warning and information systems, disaster risk management, locust control, transboundary animal diseases, and the length of its relationship with national and regional authorities put FAO in a good position to take advantage of the increasing support provided by key resource partners in resilience.",positive
"Policy development, early warning and disaster risk reduction are eminently development- oriented. Outcome 4 that deals with preparedness and response to crises, is phrased as supportive of national authorities, and the response to Typhoon Haiyan and other similar successful emergency responses have proven the relevance and effectiveness of FAO’s emergency operations in response to sudden-onset crises. The concept of resilience also challenges development interventions to incorporate risk reduction measures and promote preparedness, recovery, resilient livelihoods and peaceful societies, while at the same time generating growth. This corresponds to the cross-cutting nature of resilience, which should in theory apply to all development processes, and calls for greater collaboration between Strategic Programmes.",positive
Much progress has been made towards institutionalizing the IPC in Africa and Asia. The Early Warning / Early Action system was developed by Strategic Programme 5 to consolidate available forecasting information and has started providing comprehensive risk analyses.,positive
"The new tools and ways of working described in this report (some of which have been piloted by Strategic Programme 5 and later expanded to other Strategic Programmes) are credited with changing the conversation between headquarters and country offices towards a more demand-oriented one, and with strengthening the systemic link between the FAO technical units in resilience.",positive
"ome Regional Initiatives address issues involving several Strategic Programmes, and have generated collaboration among them. This is even truer at country level, where the Strategic Programme concerns are seamlessly brought together under the country programming frameworks, whenever there is scope for covering cross-cutting or complementary areas of work.",positive
"They helped clarify the mutually agreed areas of work between government and FAO, attract the attention of donors, and identify possible areas of collaboration. In the staff survey, the CPF was rated as the single most useful FAO mechanism.",positive
"he counterexample of the IPC, steadfastly promoted by FAO since its inception and institutionalized in a growing number of countries and regions, shows that FAO can bring good local experiences up to scale by constantly improving and promoting its good practices.",positive
"The current Strategic Framework’s scope and implementation span the entire Organization, from headquarters to decentralized offices, and provides them with a clear and common results framework.",positive
"Among the range of approaches used by the regional offices in delineating and implementing the Regional Initiatives, the approach taken by the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean likely offers the best chance of success, with Regional Initiatives branded as ambitious flagship programmes, vehicles for knowledge sharing and awareness raising, funded from external resources, and implemented in collaboration with regional and national partners.",positive
Countries under “active observation and coordinated support” derive significant benefits in terms of coordinated technical backstopping from all Strategic Programmes.,positive
"FAO appears ideally positioned to contribute to the resilience agenda, due to the following external and internal advantages: a growing need for resilience support; a current reassessment of the humanitarian-development divide; FAO’s extensive experience in livelihood support, early warning and disaster risk reduction and mitigation; and the coherence of the resilience agenda with the FAO mandate.",positive
"Joint programmes and initiatives have been signed with other United Nations organizations, globally and in a large number of countries, but actual collaboration in the field remains uncommon.",positive
"AO’s capacity to perform as an opinion leader in the field of resilience is improving, notably at the global level and in regions endowed with a Regional Initiative on resilience.",positive
"Conclusion 1. The renewed interest in resilience represents a historic opportunity for FAO, which is well positioned to contribute to the resilience agenda. Nevertheless, FAO has yet to make its presence fully felt and recognised in the “resilience space” especially at country level.",positive
FAO has a comparative advantage in terms of livelihoods analysis and relevant technical capacity.,positive
"Conclusion 2: There is a gradual evolution in the reviewed portfolio towards more genuine resilience programming, with closer coordination and collaboration with programme country governments and regional institutions, and away from unsustainable and disjointed interventions.",positive
"Delimitating the domain of relevance of Strategic Programme 5 respective to that of other Strategic Programmes is relatively straightforward: Strategic Programme 5 should take the lead in countries affected by severe crises, while other Strategic Programmes should be more prominent in institutionally stable contexts with manageable levels of hazards and risks. Evidently, Strategic Programme 5 may also provide valuable inputs in the latter type of countries (e.g. on disaster risk reduction and mitigation policies).",positive
"Conclusion 3. The Strategic Programme 5 team has provided dynamic, flexible and supportive leadership and helped to “break down silos” in a useful and credible manner. However, there are still significant opportunities to merge or coordinate similar work implemented by different FAO units under Strategic Programme 5.",positive
he positive contribution of the Strategic Programme 5 team is recognised within FAO as well as by external partners and stakeholders.,positive
"Conclusion 4: The Regional Offices have employed a variety of approaches to implement the Regional Initiatives. At country level, the Country Programming Framework is filling a real need, as it helps to articulate FAO’s programmatic offer in a concise and coherent manner",positive
A range of approaches has been used to delineate and implement the new Strategic Framework at the regional level.,positive
Due to the lack of improvement in water quality the rating of Component 3 is only moderately satisfactory.,positive
Awareness is being proactively promoted and will definitely have positive impacts in the future. The Component is considered to be satisfactory,positive
motivated to continue to be involved in the Watershed Committee and other activities promoted by the project.,positive
"he BIG2050 Initiative was very well received and offers huge opportunities for stakeholders to continue to be involved. The main institutional partners, INEA, Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ) and the BIG municipalities have internalized the project results well, proactively contributing to the project activities and making them part of their routines, and since these results are linked to their institutional mandates (conservation, health of the environment, sustainable development, sanitation, research/monitoring), there is a high potential for continuity.",positive
"The project is relevant to the objectives of GEF and FAO, and is aligned with the priorities, policies and international obligations of both the federal government of Brazil and the Government of the State of Rio de Janeiro. Also, the needs of the involved municipalities (Angra dos Reis and Paraty) are adequately addressed. The project is also highly relevant to the local population, including the traditional population, which includes caiçara, maroon and indigenous communities, by offering a healthy natural environment as well as opportunities for sustainable development and maintenance of livelihoods.",positive
"An effective Watershed Committee was established, with considerable community participation. Another important aspect is that the BIG2050 Challenge (see Conclusion 3) is of a very inclusive, democratic and accessible nature. The Challenge is open to anyone, be it individually or as part of any organization, and procedures are kept as simple as possible, as to permit access even for people with relatively low levels of formal schooling. The “Challenge” itself attracts much attention of the press and general public which has considerable impacts on awareness levels.",positive
"and some conservation units were strengthened. Relevant policies, legislation, regulations and management plans were produced, public awareness has been raised, and serious efforts are still being made to institutionalize the BIG2050 Initiative and to guarantee its sustainable financing. Hopefully through the Challenge it will be possible to tackle current future issues affecting the health of the BIG Ecosystem",positive
"Addressing a wide range of issues, including Protected Area Management, Integrated Ecosystem Management, Watershed Management, Spatial Planning, Marine Pollution and Sanitation, the project is clearly relevant to the health of the BIG area by dealing with the problems identified in the Project Information Form (PIF) and ProDoc.",positive
"With the exception of Component 2, the project managed to implement its activities more or less according to plans.",positive
"This Initiative did, though, enable the achievement of a series of objectives related to Component 2.",positive
This will lead to improved management of the BIG area and reduction of negative impacts. Results obtained under Component 1 were considered to be satisfactory.,positive
"The BIG2050 Initiative has so far been very effective towards achieving its main, long-term conservation and sustainable use of the Ilha Grande Bay Ecosystem.",positive
"Moreover, the Initiative is highly adaptive, democratic and inclusive.",positive
Delivery of outputs may therefore be considered highly satisfactory.,positive
The local population was actively involved from the formulation stage onwards.,positive
The BIG2050 Initiative is highly democratic and its calls for proposals are easily accessible for people with low levels of formal education.,positive
"Conclusion 1. The project’s objectives, strategies and actions were relevant to the needs and priorities of all beneficiaries and stakeholders.",positive
Conclusion 3. Through adaptive management the project was able to adapt itself after the setback of the Bocaina Mosaic to develop and pursue an alternative strategy.,positive
"Conclusion 6. In terms of social participation, the project has generated significant result",positive
Conclusion 7. The project created a good basis for the achievement of the general objective.,positive
"FAO acted on COAG’s recommendation by establishing the ground for GASL to function, leading to its endorsement by COAG in May 2012. In addition to clearly aligning to the 2030 Agenda and contributing to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), GASL’s appeal was that it provided a unique forum to discuss the issues around livestock sustainability with a broad and diverse participation. GASL’s focus has been gradually broadened from a focus on natural resources to include other topics considered to encompass the main factors affecting sustainability such as social, economic and environmental issues. The growth in membership from 56 in 2015 to 105 in 2018 demonstrates its relevance as well as its potential outreach.",positive
"eing hosted as a project in FAO was instrumental to its ability to attract funding and new members, as well as maintain balance and participation among members.",positive
"While there is clear room for improvement in such areas, being hosted in FAO presents more advantages than disadvantages at this time.",positive
"The contributions and added value of GASL rest in its partnership building and knowledge sharing effects, which have been clearly appreciated by its members. Reaching a common approach and definition of sustainable livestock will require time and concerted efforts, and GASL, with its broad membership, is well positioned to contribute to this goal.",positive
"ASL’s goal of advancing towards a common vision for sustainable livestock requires continuous compilation of evidence, and application of policies and practices based on local contexts; this learning mechanism was facilitated by the creation of Action Networks.",positive
"The design of the Project reflected its intended nature as a vehicle to establish a Global Agenda with a global mandate and a broad stakeholder participation, with the ultimate goal of policy and practice change in the livestock sector.",positive
"While the ultimate results and impacts of GASL will only become apparent in time, the approach of this initiative has demonstrated encouraging progress towards a more consensual view on sustainable livestock as well as policy and practice change.",positive
"The Project is clearly aligned and contributing to the strategic priories of FAO and members of the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock, as well as several SDGs. It is addressing a gap in the global discourse on livestock sustainability which was not being addressed by other stakeholders.",positive
"The Project has successfully established and expanded the Global Agenda for Sustainable Livestock into an attractive and inclusive platform. Being hosted in FAO, and supported through the Agenda Support Team, has been critical in attracting members and donors;",positive
"GASL has proven to be effective in enabling some exchange of knowledge, tools and best practices among members, and there is an expectation by members that it will do so even more in the future, thereby creating an incentive for continued participation.",positive
"oday, FAO has a fully established Subregional Office for Central Asia (SEC), as well as adequate infrastructure with representation and offices in most countries, except Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.",positive
"n addition, the process of developing the Country Programming Frameworks (CPFs) has helped to facilitate increased collaboration in the region. During the programme period, a good foundation has been developed, which will benefit the next phase.",positive
The portfolio is aligned with the national and regional development priorities and with FAO regional priorities.,positive
"Part of these aspects have been addressed over the duration of the programme, and the improved infrastructure should benefit the next phase of programming.",positive
"Contributions have been noted in three areas: support for evidence-based policy formulation, the creation of knowledge products and technical guidance, and investment in strengthening technical capacities within FAO and in counterpart institutions, supported by normative products.",positive
"This included preliminary analyses, vulnerability assessments and field trials to identify appropriate actions and target groups in both, strategic action plans and immediate action projects. As a result, all projects were found to be aligned with both the provisions of the Treaty and other international agreements and conventions including Millennium Development Goals, Convention of Biological Diversity and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",positive
"Taking into account the above- mentioned results, the evaluation considers that the immediate action projects represent good value for money, especially when average expenditure per project was USD 221 000.",positive
"Furthermore, there were cases in some of the farming communities visited in Guatemala, Malawi and Peru where crop diversity had increased and production of local varieties was actually registering higher productivity rates than at the end of the immediate action projects.",positive
"All 19 projects addressed important gaps both at the regional/national and local/agro- ecological zone levels, in particular the need to enhance the linkages between in situ and ex situ conservation of PGRFA and its sustainable use to safeguard the food security of vulnerable communities.",positive
"The strategic action plans represented an effective means through which a large number of different stakeholders linked to PGRFA could exchange information, carry out research and analysis, and develop consensus on the actions needed to advance in situ and ex situ conservation and sustainable use of PGRFA. Lead farmers trained by the immediate action projects made significant contributions to: i) in situ conservation of PGRFA through seed transfer of local/improved varieties of PGRFA from the national gene banks; and ii) recognition and valorization of farmers’ knowledge and capacity to conserve local varieties that are highly adapted to local conditions.",positive
"Supporting vulnerable farming communities in marginal rural areas is an effective and sustainable way of conserving PGRFA, as well as increasing the availability to facilitate its sustainable use.",positive
"n addition, since the Project was designed with the participation of the authorities of the Decentralized Autonomous Government of the Province of Chimborazo (GADPCH), it managed to achieve a strong sense of appropriation and alignment with the Land Use and Development Plan (LUDP) of the GADPCH. In addition, communities consulted showed great acceptance during project implementation.",positive
"For example, 111 communities participated in the generation of the management and co-management plans based on zoning in five micro watersheds and that included a participatory prioritization of pilot sub-projects through mutual agreement between the GADPCH and the communities. In another example, seven communities of the RPFCH buffer zone participated in the design of the co-management plans and a vicuña16 working group was created to define by consensus who the beneficiaries would be and how they would be involved. The selection of the final participants was performed in coordination with the GADPCH and another operational project in the area of intervention (PIDD project) to avoid the overlapping of beneficiaries in the pilot projects identified and ensure that the beneficiaries selected agreed to co-fund their implementation (by means of the rendering of manual labour, the delivery of local materials, etc.) and with the aim of promoting their appropriation and the sustainability perspectives.",positive
"Without doubt, this situation facilitated a high level of training of female leaders in the vast majority of communities involved. In addition, it was found that there was substantial participation by female professionals in the OPIM and at various levels of the DAGs.",positive
"ndoubtedly, in these cases there will be opportunities to continue strengthening institutional structures at community level, such as the co-management committees of said management plans because the GADPCH will continue with campaigns to raise awareness on the importance of conserving the paramo.",positive
"t was coherent with the GEF mandate on fitting FAO's Strategic Objective 2 into its Biodiversity Strategy Area (Objectives 1 and 2). At national and subnational level it was coherent with the National Biodiversity Strategy and the Strategic Plan of the National System of Protected Areas of Ecuador and, at provincial level, with the LUDP and GADPCH. In terms of the beneficiary communities, there was a high level of project acceptance as it responded to their needs, including their adaptation to the effects of climate change, particularly a marked reduction of water in the water basins in recent years.",positive
"The Project managed to achieve the specific objectives established with regard to its three components. In particular, the fulfilment of the following expected outcomes was verified:",positive
The Project managed to actively involve a high number of stakeholders and local communities.,positive
"The evaluation was satisfied that the Project had integrated a gender focus. For example, the women interviewed stated that they played an important role in the Project - taking into consideration that the majority are the heads of their families due to the high migration of men in the area of intervention.",positive
The Project showed significant coherence with different levels of stakeholders at national and international level.,positive
he OPIM showed that it is a management approach that can execute GEF funds in a decentralized manner in the subnational institutional infrastructure and convert its funds into the outcomes and tangible changes expected in the ProDoc.,positive
"The project logic in terms of technical approach was strong, drawing from internationally accepted standard practices. However, stakeholders interviewed largely acknowledged the ambitiousness of the project’s environmental and development objectives.",positive
"In Ghana, relevant stakeholders carried out key project activities.",positive
"he project even managed to compensate for limited resources by partnering with institutions having capacity in similar relevant areas as the project, including the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture to work on the alternative livelihoods aspect.",positive
"More than 200 000 trees were planted, awareness generated in the communities, and some capacity developed in communities and governmental institutions for conservation development actions. Importantly, the project supported the development of synergies and collaboration between stakeholders from the two countries. This gain became a lesson learned for future projects showing that trans-frontier collaboration must be promoted at all levels, including the highest level, in each country. Stakeholders should share a vision and work in synergy towards a common goal.",positive
Exchange visits between stakeholders of the two countries resulted in mutual inspiration. The trainings on conservation techniques and issues related to human-wildlife conflict adequately targeted beneficiaries and were well received – the average satisfaction score was 3.6 out 4 among community members.,positive
"The project managed to engage stakeholders in the issues of conservation and forest and wildlife protection, and the evaluation recommends immediate actions to continue current work as well as plans to scale up activities to preserve important gains achieved.",positive
Relevant transfer of capacity was more successful in Ghana than in Côte d’Ivoire.,positive
"Conservation Alliance, the primary executing partner for both countries and based in Ghana, was a coherent and efficient partner for the Ghanaian side of the project.",positive
"Capacity development, primarily at community level, represents another achievement of the project.",positive
"Despite the delays and limited tangible results of the project, most stakeholders expressed high levels of satisfaction with the project given achievements despite limited resources.",positive
SBP established water user associations (WUA) and progressed the Government’s policy for creation of an IWRM governance structure as a means to decentralize water regulation and support local development. The project was relevant to FAO’s country programme and the objectives of the Government of the Netherlands in Yemen aimed at sustainable groundwater usage and resilient livelihoods.,positive
"contributed to FAO’s Strategic Objective 2 through productivity enhancement, sustainable food systems, investment in rural infrastructure; empowerment of women; improved water efficiency and sustainable use of natural resources. The project also supported the FAO-managed Regional Initiative on Water Scarcity in Near East and North Africa.",positive
"SBP also supported WUAs to provide services to their members such as input supply, marketing and processing farmer produce. Sustainability of WUAs will depend on the services they can deliver to their members and the willingness of farmers to pay for these services. This will also be a factor in the sustainability of results.",positive
The IWRM governance structure devolves authority to local organisations to regulate water usage and formulate their longer term development plans.,positive
WUA helped increase institutional and individual capacities. Women were integrated into governance structures and decision-making processes.,positive
"he collaborative effort between two ministries helped deliver project results as they needed to work adeptly to keep SBP on schedule as much as possible following the outbreak of war, which caused disruptions to funding and workplans. The project team was flexible in adapting to these disruptions and alterations to the project design (e.g. the decision to drop the pilot waste water treatment unit and support farmers to access water in shallow wells with solar pumps).",positive
"By promoting modern irrigation systems and improved, climate-smart cropping practices SBP remained relevant to the many farmers seeking alternatives to their current cropping systems based on accessing increasingly expensive groundwater.",positive
"Adaptation of modern irrigation systems, protected agriculture production, introduction of crop varieties more tolerant of low water regimes, and support to farmers to switch to alternative cash crops helped SBP deliver its objective of improving farmer productivity, incomes and resilience whilst reducing groundwater abstraction.",positive
A competent project team that worked collaboratively and flexibly in a difficult operational environment was the main factor contributing to effective project outcomes.,positive
The IWRM action plan provides a 10-year development strategy with WUAs integral to implementation of the plan.,positive
"Animal disease control and climate change effects were priorities tackled under the 2011-2016 Country Programming Framework (CPF) while a bigger scope of priorities was aligned to the successor 2016-2020 CPF. These included: i) strengthening policy and institutional framework, enhancing agriculture productivity and competitiveness; ii) focusing on enhancing livelihoods, food and nutrition security, promoting integration of smallholder farmers into markets; and iii) increasing community resilience in partnership with the public and private sectors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations.",positive
takeholder interest in policy engagement was heightened leading to participation in the formulation of the draft Livestock Policy and other benefits such as expanded capacity development and participation in other national policy level activities.,positive
"Additionally, interaction between buyers, auctioneers, meat graders and farmers as key players within the livestock value chain has increased.",positive
"he Project negotiated for cost-sharing with the Livestock Development Association in the purchase of breeding animals, which resulted in the LDA being able to acquire revolving funds used to purchase start-up kits with veterinary drugs, equipment, feeds and meet some of their operational costs. The Livestock Development Association also mobilized farmers to register their animals which has improved livestock identification, on record to have positively contributed to reduced cattle theft.",positive
"They were sensitized to appreciate farming as a business also trained in livestock business investments. The Project targeted improving group dynamics including skills in group leadership which has occasioned cohesion and improved group dynamics. These and the previously mentioned achievements have collectively contributed to improved livestock production and productivity as per project objectives. As a result, cattle owners reported an improved return on investment, mainly associated with improved sales linked to improved live animal slaughter weight and carcass quality.",positive
"At ward level, the Livestock Development Association and User Committees (e.g. water subcommittees and dip-tank management committees) mobilized communities and rendered the leadership role. At the district level, the Livestock Development Associations and Inter-district Project Committees provided technical and managerial advice, while the process was steered by the Project Implementation Committee at provincial level and the Project Steering Committee at national level.",positive
Technical persons from the government departments of Livestock and Veterinary Services and AGRITEX-handling extension and gender and nutrition experts from FAO were all sufficiently engaged rendering ownership in case of government and overall participation easily attainable.,positive
"The support to institutions and enabling environment, policy provisions within the draft policy document and the sensitized associations are strong collective elements to sustain the gains made through the Project.",positive
"The Project was in line with the priorities in the CPF. Through this project, FAO supported the establishment of an enabling policy environment in livestock, an area which is most strategically suitable to undertake in Zimbabwe.",positive
"The Project addressed several elements of FAO’s Strategic Objectives in support of creating an enabling policy environment, increasing food and nutrition security and provision of goods and services from agriculture.",positive
"The Project piloted for a review of the taxation policy and the reduction of livestock market levy from about USD 100 to USD 30 per animal for Nkayi and Lupane districts, which was a key factor conducive for livestock farmers to engage in the formal market.",positive
"Because the implementers, LEAD and HELP Germany had long-standing agreements with the Government and were already working in the two districts, field coordination and implementation was relatively smooth.",positive
"Success stories were written by Project implementers and some have already been shared for learning, replication and upscaling.",positive
"The Project was relevant, timely and well aligned to address strategic needs of the Government of Zimbabwe.",positive
They not only helped in curtailing the spread of diseases but also improved the health of animals and overall increase in livestock productivity.,positive
"rect implementation by FAO was efficient and effective in the context of this project, reinforcing ownership and trust.",positive
FAO support for fish production activities was promising if further supported.,positive
FATA’s agriculture rehabilitation is mostly dependent on the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations’ (FAO’s) support - as FAO is the only agriculture-based agency operating in FATA.,positive
"The direct implementation of the project by FAO and active involvement of government line departments and community organizations ensured partnership and increased interest, ownership, motivation and recognition of achievements among partners.",positive
"Its design was the subject of a thorough diagnosis and involved the key actors of mangrove management in Cameroon. In addition, the project provides solutions for community-based management of mangrove ecosystems. Indeed, this issue of community-based management of mangrove ecosystems was not taken into account in community forest management norms in Cameroon before the implementation of this project.",positive
The project also contributed to the creation of three platforms.,positive
"owever, one of the positive points remains the facilitation, through this component, of the grassroots structuring of communities through support to the grouping and their formalization into legal associations. The project also transferred knowledge and skills to the different actors involved in the economic sectors of the different intervention zones through several studies and training. In addition, the project filled an important gap in the Manual of Procedures for the Attribution and Norms for the Management of Community Forests by taking into account the specific management of mangroves at community level. It is in this perspective that the project facilitated the establishment of the first community mangrove forest in Cameroon. This community forest is a good example of an area dedicated to community-based management of mangrove resources.",positive
"However, it can be seen that a number of lessons were drawn that provide a solid basis to guide future actions that could be taken to improve livelihoods as a sustainable mangrove management strategy.",positive
"The platforms set up by the project, as a forum bringing together the main actors, can contribute to the sustainability of the project if they are able to set up lobbying and advocacy actions and mobilize additional resources.",positive
"The project is considered firstly relevant in view of all the threats and problems acknowledged to be drivers of deforestation and forest degradation that it proposes to address, and secondly, in view of its alignment with government policy on the environment including wetlands and coastal ecosystems.",positive
"With regards to the production of information and monitoring of mangrove ecosystems, the project contributed to the preparation of a Report on the State of Cameroon’s Mangroves and the publication of an Atlas.",positive
One of the results of this project was the strengthening of mangrove conservation through the creation and improved management of three protected areas.,positive
"This initial weakness was partially corrected with the introduction of a qualitative outcome indicator of community capability, and by the introduction of Output 5.",positive
"Village development committees felt involved in the JRP process and considered CAPs a valuable document for project implementation. Community consultations were relevant as they created ownership of the project, could contribute to strengthening communities’ resilience and were important to ensure demand-driven implementation",positive
adjustment of targets (reduction of community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM)). Most of these changes aimed to adapt design and implementation to the context and were thus relevant. The recalibration of the project indicates the significant flexibility of agencies and donors,positive
Overall they have gained skills through the project.,positive
Involved ministers appreciated the JRP from their own sectoral perspective but did not achieve an overall picture of the programme.,positive
"Health status and health practices have improved as well. Interesting effects concerned behaviour changes likely to improve the capacity of the population to reduce maternal and child malnutrition. This is a strength of the JRP and it shows that investing jointly on different communication means and techniques, with the combined approach of IYCF (UNICEF) and SBCC –(WFP) targeting the same population with coherent messages achieves results in a relatively short period.",positive
"he CMAM programme was extended and good cooperation between WFP and UNICEF contributed to ensure its quality. The support provided to community health workers and mother support groups reinforced community capacity to prevent malnutrition and diseases, to identify malnutrition and to promote good practices",positive
"However sensitization on hygiene was implemented in a wider area through Output 2, as well as Output 5.",positive
"ffects of Output 2 activities are observable with some key changes of behaviour, e.g. care seeking in case of child sickness; improvement of health or nutrition status",positive
"Most Output 4 activities are relevant to needs as they contributed to household food security and livelihoods, some being clearly linked to climatic shocks.",positive
Community consultations were a relevant approach that should be capitalized upon and further developed.,positive
"he JRP demonstrated significant flexibility on behalf of agencies and their partners as well as the donor, and this proved essential to adapt the intervention to the context during the course of the project.",positive
Both FAO and OIE have unique and distinct mandates that provide them with respective strategic roles in TADs control and these are widely accepted among stakeholders.,positive
"To support the competencies of veterinary services in implementing standards, OIE has developed the Performance of Veterinary Services (PVS) Pathway, a voluntary programme for the evaluation of veterinary services. FAO and OIE need to work together to control and prevent TADs using the GF-TADs platform.",positive
"The joint development of the One Health concept and disease control programmes for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), rinderpest, PPR and FMD was also acknowledged.",positive
"rogress has been made to improve leadership and governance of TADs programmes, better policies and strategic planning.",positive
"Leadership in the control and prevention of TADs is appropriately being provided by the international animal health agencies, FAO and OIE.",positive
Good progress was recognized in the joint implementation of governance by FAO and OIE at global and regional levels.,positive
The objectives of the GF-TADs have been achieved to a degree that significantly varies from one region to the other and reflects the differences in GF-TADs relevance.,positive
The partnership between FAO and OIE was seen as highly relevant and improved since the Second Evaluation in 2009.,positive
The role of RECs varies across the regions but has generally been strong.,positive
There is a continuing need for the GF-TADs platform due to continuing emergence and spread of TADs and due to the unique features of the platform. T,positive
A regional approach and organizational solutions are justified in recognition of regional differences of the needs for TADs control.,positive
"AO’s ability to undertake sound analysis and provide a holistic capacity development support was evident in standard setting and system development in the emerging areas where the establishment of a new system was needed. FAO worked on food safety, agriculture information and climate change mitigation.",positive
FAO interventions adequately took into consideration gender mainstreaming.,positive
"n doing so, FAO provided a good mix of policy assistance, capacity development, impact studies and technical assistance in the field.",positive
"In Priority Area B (Outcome: improved multi-sector participation, coordination and value chain development in food and nutrition security programme), FAO implemented two full TCPs to address constraints surrounding the production of two staple commodities. Also, FAO formulated a Unilateral Trust Fund project (funded by the World Bank) to improve productivity and support the commercialization of selected commodities.",positive
"In Priority Area C (Outcome: information and communication system in food and nutrition security strengthened), FAO implemented a project to prepare RNR census, which is critical for making sound policy decisions, designing development interventions and developing information and communication systems in the RNR sectors.",positive
"FAO interventions were institutionalized with a high degree of ownership by the Government at central and district levels. Studies and the results of the field research were reflected in policy formulation, institutional building and capacity development activities.",positive
AO activities were implemented through a steering committee at national level and sectors following the agreed annual workplan at the dzongkhag and gewog levels. Efficient government and close communication with the Policy and Planning Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests helped ensure smooth programme implementation.,positive
FAO interventions made direct and noticeable contributions towards some of the sector level objectives such as production growth and sustainable natural resource management and utilization.,positive
Government acknowledges FAO as a key technical partner and anticipates more active mobilization of external resources. Other organizations have mobilized funds from regional/international funding mechanisms (e.g. Green Climate fund -GCF- Global Environment Facility – GEF - South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation - SAARC) in the areas of FAO mandate including food security and agricultural resilience. Various agencies work in the FAO’s technical areas.,positive
"iven its limited financial resources, FAO has successfully curved a niche in the policy, institutional and system development and pilot testing of localized global knowledge. In doing so, FAO targeted appropriate beneficiaries who were most effective in building the basis for long-term capacity and disseminating the knowledge.",positive
"FAO interventions contributed to policy, legal and institutions strengthening in the RNR sector. This should serve as a basis for sustainability provided that the Government continues to allocate funds and human resources to carry the activities forward",positive
"n the other hand, FAO’s holistic capacity development approach brought about good synergies within a project. Also, good synergies were found between normative and programme work. FAO interventions utilized the Organization’s global knowledge while undertaking studies to understand specific local needs and capacity gaps.",positive
FAO addressed some sectoral priorities that could increase the welfare of the poor and vulnerable people through the enhancement of food security and resilience.,positive
"FAO interventions triggered behaviour changes through the development of new systems, methods and procedures as well as the introduction of new technologies and practices at different levels.",positive
Good synergies were found between normative and field programme work.,positive
FAO programme’s Priorities Areas are aligned to the national development plan’s Key Result Areas and its RNR sector policy goals.,positive
FAO has been effective in working with the Government.,positive
"Given that the Government and some other agencies have advantages in focusing on the most marginalized segment of the population and women, FAO operated in its niche while integrating the normative values in its programme design.",positive
A high degree of government ownership was observed at both central and field levels.,positive
FAO’s programme is coherent with national development plans and UNDAF in terms of alignment of thematic areas and outcomes.,positive
"CASU monitoring data demonstrated that while both the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and Women’s Dietary Diversity Score (WDDS) were relatively high at the baseline, they also both improved during the project period. Farmers reported improved dietary diversity and quantity in focus groups. The University of Zambia household survey found that CASU activities have had a positive effect on both HDDS and WDD",positive
"roduction was significantly better for maize each year under CA. Yields per hectare with CA increased for all the major crops except for mixed beans, though there was seasonal variation.",positive
"Increased legume production is a positive outcome and is likely to lead to improved soil fertility and nutrition, however, it demonstrates that the CA message is still not fully accepted by farmers.",positive
"This should significantly improve any further input delivery, as well as field level monitoring. FAO’s task force was underutilized by CASU.",positive
"The design of CASU was consistent with the Government of the Republic of Zambia policies and plans, and with the strategies of the Ministry of Agriculture for promotion of CA and climate- sensitive agriculture. By nature, it is aiming for environmentally-sustainable production (though the agro-forestry elements were weak and there are potentially some risks with herbicide use). The application of quotas for women in the recruitment of LFs and FFs was an important element for increasing involvement of women.",positive
"ultivated land under CA has increased, both for LFs and FFs, and an increased proportion of land was used for CA production of maize.",positive
The uptake of the Zambia Integrated Agricultural Management Information System (ZIAMIS) by the Government of the Republic of Zambia is an unintended positive outcome.,positive
The CASU monitoring system is complex and collects a considerable amount of potentially useful data.,positive
The development and handover of the Management Information System (MIS)/e-voucher system to the Ministry of Agriculture was significant and was facilitated by FAO in working as a trusted partner to the Ministry of Agriculture.,positive
"was instrumental in mainstreaming the conservation of agrobiodiversity in the National Biodiversity Strategy (2016) and in several LUDP at a provincial and cantonal level. In the province of Chimborazo the LUDP assigns government funds to promote agrobiodiversity. It also facilitated the drafting of the law on agrobiodiversity and seeds, which was passed and registered in June 2017.",positive
"total of 494 accessions of supposedly new varieties of crops were provided to the BNG and it was possible to scale up good practices associated with the conservation and development of in situ agrobiodiversity for the benefit of more than 4,000 people, most of whom are women.",positive
"It was also possible to establish three Bio-knowledge and Agricultural Development Centres (BADC), one of which is linked to a university in Imbabura and the other is in an area of land belonging to the provincial council of the province of Chimborazo. A total of 4,509 farmers and promoters participated in training linked to the conservation and sustainable use of agrobiodiversity, the application of the PGS and the development of short sales channels, particularly the development of agroecological fairs that are contributing to increasing farmers' incomes from USD 20 to almost USD100/week, which demonstrates that rural women's smallholdings can generate income exceeding the country's minimum wage (USD 375/month).",positive
"n the province of Loja, it has promoted the establishment of school gardens that are highly valued by teachers and students, and are very effective at enhancing communication about the benefits of agrobiodiversity and the preparation of organic fertilisers.",positive
"It was found that during the identification and design of the project, the INIAP and the Heifer Foundation consulted with a wide range of stakeholder representatives beforehand. The entry into 19 partnership agreements to support the transfer of technology and develop the marketing of agrobiodiversity products in local markets and fairs was very successful in promoting active participation by small- scale farmers. In particular, the project made it possible to exceed the planned number of participating farmers (4,509 instead of 3,800 people). The employment of three coordinators for each intervention area (north, central and south) and six promoters, four of which are bilingual indigenous people, facilitated the inclusive participation of Kichwa-speaking men and women in the activities and training of the project in the three intervention areas and contributed towards providing greater recognition of the promoters as holders of ancestral knowledge. The benefits of this approach included gathering 494 accessions and the local monitoring of the field activities with the beneficiaries.",positive
"A study of agroecological fairs in La Esperanza and Saraguro concluded that they have contributed towards increasing sellers' annual incomes by 17.3 percent from 2015 to 2016, approximately 90 percent of whom are women. However, the evaluation found that their participation in these fairs has made it possible not only to generate financial income for the first time but also increase their self-esteem and power to purchase food, medicine, schoolbooks, etc. With regard to the workload, it is observed that the implementation of agriculturally diverse plots and the preparation of organic supplies around the farm saves women financial resources and time, although it was not possible to identify more specific data on the matter.",positive
"e Regulation is passed with 1.0 to 0.5 percent of the country's annual GDP to create and maintain the stability of the fund, it is likely that there will be sufficient resources to apply the law",positive
"With regard to the project's potential impact in upcoming years, the evaluation believes that it is likely to be moderate if the Regulation is passed and the creation of an agrobiodiversity fund with the aforementioned percentages is approved.",positive
"In particular, it has been found that giving greater recognition to local crops encourages male and female peasant farmers to reduce their dependence on seeds from hybrid crops that have to be bought in technological packages because the seed cannot be reproduced. Consequently, the promotion of agrobiodiversity by means of the project has had a positive effect on family farmers' food sovereignty and food security. Other benefits include, among others, an improvement in diet and health (mental and physical) due to eating more varieties, maintaining a healthier environment as a result of using organic supplies, recuperating ancestral customs and identity as part of the national and",positive
"medicinal heritage and developing new opportunities for generating income by selling products that are high in nutritional and financial value in niche markets, such as agroecological fairs and typical restaurants that want to promote Ecuadorian cuisine. Consequently, it can also be concluded that agrobiodiversity contributes towards several Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) under this holistic concept such as: reducing rural poverty (SDG 1), reducing hunger/malnutrition (SDG 2), ensuring healthy lives and well-being (SDG 3), achieving gender equality (SDG 5), improving water quality by using organic supplies (SDG 6), developing the rural economy and reducing migration (SDG 8), promoting responsible consumption (SDG 12), adapting to climate change to protect food security (SDG 13) and conserving plant genetic resources in situ (SDG 15).",positive
"With regard to component 1, the project facilitated the integration of agrobiodiversity in the National Biodiversity Strategy and some Land Use and Development Plans (LUDPs) at a provincial and cantonal level, and supported the drafting of the law on agrobiodiversity and seeds, which was approved and registered in June 2017.",positive
"At the level of the beneficiary communities, there has been a catalytic effect in cases where farmers had the opportunity to observe the activities in person and then replicate them, as has been the case with the preparation of organic supplies.",positive
"infrastructure for the collection, storage, display (geoportal) and analysis of geospatial, territorial and environmental data on the Napo Province, institutional access and management of territorial and environmental information about the province was improved.",positive
"Thus, a general overview of the technical execution of the initiative is kept up-to-date. Therefore, although the team is creating a monitoring and evaluation system, the project was not fully operational at the time of evaluation.",positive
"However, it proved to be responsive, making the human and operating adjustments needed to organise and invigorate the technical and financial execution.",positive
It should be noted that the DIM modality has managed to successfully combine financial and technical administration based in the FAO office with the appropriation and materialisation of the project benefits by the NPDAG.,positive
"However, the team designed a strategy focused on solving this issue, which was ultimately successful.",positive
"Therefore, implementation featured the creation of joint management plans. Due to this, it managed to be inclusive and focused on the acceptance of all the parties involved.",positive
"However, it was found that the project managed to promote the participation and leadership of women in most of the initiative activities. They were summoned and participated in 40% (a total of 793) activities in the project. This percentage is satisfactory and represents progress towards the fulfilment of objectives one and three of the FAO gender policy",positive
"Four new political, institutional and environmental risks were identified, which must be taken into account given that they could affect project sustainability. They are: a. Constitutional referendum: If passed, re-election terms would be restricted, increasing the likelihood of changes in authorities in local governments; b. Commitment to Government institutionality: Implementation of the project outputs linked to institutional sustainability, especially FODESNA, will require signatures and approval from several government institutions at the central and local levels; c. Comprehensive Amazon Act: This new law is expected to be passed in early 2018. Among other initiatives, it includes a system of monetary incentives for local governments that have oil-related investments, which could prompt the expansion of the oil industry in the south-east Napo Province; d. Large Agriculture and Livestock Cooperative programme: A public policy designed to promote agriculture and livestock development in Ecuador. One of the measures established is the subsidised delivery of a million kits containing supplies, seeds, fertilisers and fungicides to small- scale farmers.",positive
"mid-term, it has managed to promote the values of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity among decision-makers, public servants and beneficiaries. Thus, it can be confirmed that the project has taken a fundamental step in consolidating an improvement in the provision of goods and services from biodiversity. Proving that the practices promoted under the project give rise to a better livelihood and an increase in the producers’ income remains pending.",positive
"These achievements are deemed satisfactory in the evaluation because they focus on accomplishing results related to sustainable production and biodiversity conservation and at the same time, they are well connected to the future implementation of value chain plans for cocoa, naranjilla and biotrade products which, if they achieve the effects they seek, would generate an improvement in the livelihood and income of beneficiary families.",positive
"These positive features have provided a strong capacity to respond to drawbacks such as the initial delays in implementation and delays in the provision of the co-financing. When faced with these events, the team in general and its leaders in particular designed and implemented strategies to successfully solve them.",positive
"The process began with the identification of the Kichwa people as an affected indigenous group and a project target and the establishment of dialogue with community and indigenous organisations and leaders. This made it possible to discern their specific needs, unique worldviews, cultural and production practices and ways of organisation, making the design and subsequent execution of the project consistent.",positive
"Despite this fact, the project was found to have promoted the participation of women in most of the initiative activities.",positive
"The project design displayed good vertical consistency, and the implementation and design of the components, outcomes and outputs of the project are closely aligned with and relevant to Outcomes 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4 of FAO’s strategic objective 2 and GEF objectives LD-1, LD-3 BD-2 and SFM/REDD+-1, priority areas 1 and 4 of the Country Programming Framework (CPF) of FAO-EC, and the axes, objectives and policies included in the National Plan for Good Living (PNBV) 2013 – 2017 and PNBV 2017 – 2021 of the government of Ecuador.",positive
The degree of progress towards the ultimate goals and the level of activity implementation is considered satisfactory for each of the components and for most of the outputs of the project.,positive
"The DIM intervention modality, which reduced the bureaucracy involved and familiarised the FAO-EC team with administrative standards and procedures, facilitated efficient management of the project.",positive
"After two years implementing the project, the NPDAG authorities and civil servants, as a result of their active participation and ongoing coordination with the project staff, have begun to interiorise and confirm their commitment to conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity as a cornerstone of their provincial development strategy.",positive
"t is responding to national and provincial environmental needs and priorities, contributing to the United Nations Development Cooperation Strategy (UNDCS) and the FAO Country Programme in Turkey, and aligned with the priorities of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and FAO’s Strategic Objectives. It also conforms to relevant and current international treaties and conventions, and contributes to the achievement of FAO’s commitments to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets",positive
"Still, there are indications that through the Farmer Field Schools, the farming techniques being promoted by the Project will become sustainable.",positive
The findings showed that the Project is highly relevant.,positive
"On the positive side, the evaluation noted the complementary efforts being made by the Government and other partners that are being reported in terms of their co-financing on the Project, and the good technical support being obtained by the Project from FAO headquarters and the Subregional Office.",positive
"The findings also suggested that at mid-point, the Project is moderately likely to be sustainable.",positive
gnment is better at national level and less so at county level. The degree of alignment is one of the elements that permit FAO to be strategically positioned as an important partner for national stakeholders.,positive
"The county office model, both in terms of approach and sustainability requires detailed assessment in order to determine its continuity.",positive
"tnerships for FAO are an important mechanism for conducting and implementing its programme. It has established partnerships with a diverse number of stakeholders, both formally or ad hoc. FAO implements activities primarily through government entities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the areas of food security and agriculture production (with a focus on conservation agriculture). Other partnership areas include livestock production and animal disease control, plant disease control and surveillance, research and resilience activities.",positive
"Besides FAO having acted as one of the main facilitators in training county agriculture staff as soon as the devolved units were in place, they have also been actively engaged in the fora that guide the setting of priorities in matters relating to agricultural development at the county and national level.",positive
Emphasis has been given to supporting policy and strategy formulation at the national level.,positive
"The Country Programme Framework was useful in that it set the main lines of work that addressed identified needs, yet allowed amplitude to address unforeseen, emergent issues. FAO response to emerging needs was largely appropriate",positive
Having a presence in counties gives FAO an intimate understanding of the local situation while also improving coordination with county governments and enabling the development of diverse partnerships with various stakeholder organizations working in the respective counties.,positive
AO has responded appropriately to emergencies by providing material and/or technical support. Response effectiveness has been hampered by delays in procuring inputs.,positive
FAO has established successful partnerships and has played an important role in various coordination fora. Partners consider the collaboration with FAO as very valuable,positive
"While responding to the changes brought on by devolution, FAO became a valuable partner in various forums at the national and county level.",positive

"O’s contributions to achieving Outcome 2 are significant given the evidence of increased production gains reported, diversification of crops and inroads in accessing markets.",positive
"Mariculture initiatives show promise, with positive effects on beneficiaries identified, including increases in income and diversification in sources of nutritious food.",positive
"FAO contributions pertaining to land were appropriate as they supported the development of an implementation framework and procedures for the recognition, protection and registration of community land rights.",positive
"FAO efforts ensured that expertise and knowledge were available to stakeholders, data on food security, diseases and other issues were generated and that early warning and information management systems were at the disposal of decision makers.",positive
FAO has been successful in establishing partnerships and collaborative relationships with a diverse number of actors at the national and county levels in the areas addressed by the CPF.,positive
"O has a strong comparative advantage in areas within its mandate. Stakeholders attribute this to its technical expertise, ability to tap into a vast network of specialists and a comprehensive knowledge products base.",positive
"FAO has made important contributions under the outcome areas contained in the CPF, working with multiple stakeholders at the national and county levels, including the public and private sector, communities and academia.",positive
"Recognition and appreciation were reiterated by bodies within the Ministries of Agriculture, Water and Environment as well as civil society.",positive
"Nevertheless, FAO’s Programme did contribute to some noted achievements. The exceptions are the relatively large Nutrition Project and ECTAD, in the case of which project identification and formulation, as well as resource mobilization for implementation, related to the pre- revolution period. Satisfactory results were achieved under the two projects on food loss and waste and value chains. A noted result was achieved by the project on date cultivation in Siwa Oasis, which has declared the production system in the Oasis as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System and will effectively support the small-scale family farming.",positive
"It is also important to note that, historically, FAO has supported the Ministry in the formulation of its strategies, including the current Sustainable Agriculture Development Strategy towards 2030.",positive
This new development is likely to have a positive impact on the future of FAO’s Programme in Egypt.,positive
"FAO’s contribution to the agricultural development in Egypt is widely acknowledged by its stakeholders and partners, including multilateral organizations and bilateral donors.",positive
"FAO’s Programme has perused gender equality objectives as a sector, where the exclusive focus in the project/intervention is on women, as in the case with the Nutrition Project. Likewise, the partnership with the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) on grey water targets housewive",positive
It established a Farm and Life School for women in one village where men have all abandoned farming and sought employment elsewhere.,positive
"Overall, FAO’s Programme in Egypt is well aligned with the country priorities for the agriculture and rural development sector. The project portfolio was aligned with the FAO Strategic Framework.",positive
"With regard to FAO priorities, the CPF formulation predated the adoption of the current Strategic Framework (2013-2019), but all FAO projects were found to be well aligned to at least one Strategic Objective.",positive
"At the corporate level, the current generation of CPFs has improved on the alignment with the Strategic Framework with coherence ensured at the output level.",positive
FAO has the knowledge and means to ensure CPF priorities are based on the best contextual and technical knowledge available.,positive
The process of setting indicative resource requirements has improved overtime.,positive
Integration of SDGs is in progress nationally as well as in the FAO country programming.,positive
"In the last few years, FAO reformed country level programming, based on institutional adaptive learning.",positive
t is considered to be more cost-effective and easier to include in national household surveys than other FNS indicators. The capacity for data disaggregation is also perceived as a strong advantage.,positive
"a global standard for measuring people's experience with food security was established; FIES was endorsed as the official indicator to monitor SGD2 - Target 2.1; FAO contracted the Gallup World Poll to collect FIES data in some 145 countries in 2014, 2015 and 2016; FAO owns the methodology and all the datasets processed to date; national counterparts have had their capacities developed to implement and analyse FIES; and as of 2017, 58 countries have authorized FAO to publish national FIES data in the State of Food Insecurity in the World (SOFI) 2017. Twenty- two countries have already incorporated FIES into their national household surveys.",positive
"In line with the FAO Policy on Gender Equality, FIES has potential to orientate policies, programmes and projects aimed at addressing gender equality.",positive
"he methodology has been successfully tested worldwide and some of the results published. Since the endorsement of FIES as an official indicator for target 2.1 of Sustainable Development Goal 2, there is growing demand for FAO to support national capacities for data collection, and much need for assistance on data analysis.",positive
"Data has been collected by Gallup in some 145 countries during three consecutive years. In July 2017, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the global SDG indicator framework, including FIES as indicator 2.1.2 to monitor SDG2 – End Hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. In September 2017, the Gallup FIES data were published in the State of Food Security in the World (SOFI) for 58 countries who validated them. To date, the project team ha",positive
"provided support on FIES to around 60 countries – far more than the number originally planned. Twenty-three countries have requested further support from FAO to include FIES in their national survey, and this demand is growing. In addition, some development partners such as GAFSP, Feed the Future and GIZ are already using FIES to monitor the impact of their projects.",positive
"As such, it adds value to the existent set of indicators meant to measure different components of food security. The FIES methodology was tested and validated across different countries and languages. Similar perception-based indicators such as EBIA and ELCSA also attest for the validity of this type of scale.",positive
"and the commitment to “leave no one behind” contained in the 2030 development agenda. Moreover, the commitment to support governments in collecting sex-disaggregated data is part of FAO’s mandate and it is reflected in the FAO Policy on Gender Equality.",positive
The endorsement of FIES as part of the SDG monitoring framework for SDG 2.1 is expected to increase the number of partnerships in the future.,positive
FIES has been selected as an official indicator to monitor progress towards FAO’s SO1.,positive
"oH made cost-effective use of resources to develop FIES and endorse it as an official SDG indicator, to collect data for about 145 countries every year and to capacitate different countries to collect their own data.",positive
Support for incorporating FIES at the national level has increased over the years and is expected to increase further due to its endorsement as one of the progress indicators for SDG2.,positive
"Widespread and cross sector involvement contributed to increase the effectiveness of the project. Ministries at the national level, namely the Environmental Department and Agricultural Department, the municipal representations (communal agriculture offices), the National Coordination of Food Security (CNSA) and the National Seed Service implemented activities. Activities are also aligned with the national DRM approach and on which FAO works with the Directorate of Civil Protection",positive
"In each visited site, farmers received training emphasizing climatic hazards and enhanced storage techniques.",positive
"Through trainings, field notes and brochures communicating best practices, populations are better equipped to respond to drought, a proxy indicator of resilience. Surveys of beneficiaries reveal a majority have adopted promoted practices, and field level data suggest that approximately 75 percent among FFS members and 30 percent among non-FFS participants continue to use the new practices.",positive
"Women, in particular, received support through “cash for work” activities. Awareness raising efforts also focused on the role of women who were targeted by the project. Interviews conducted during the evaluation also suggest that irrigated agricultural production techniques in particular increased the commercial and economic opportunities for women.",positive
Response and practices adapted to the Haitian climate were promoted through the trainings related to this project. This knowledge should be propelled forward to achieve a larger scale uptake and also increase chances of sustainability.,positive
he Director of Civil Protection will continue activities in the DRM committee along with the civil protection committee. FFS are also likely to continue trainings.,positive
"Recommendations concerning the review of the Letter of Agreement signed with the South-East Environmental Department, the organization of training sessions to promote and disseminate FFS, the reorganization of the Lead Technical Officers and the dissemination of project success via internet were carried out to a limited extent.",positive
The project facilitated the temporary provision of human resources to support communal agriculture offices and local production organizations.,positive
"The country has benefited from previous emergency projects, even those implemented on a small scale.",positive
FAO provided institutional and policy support to the Government to implement trainings and promote climate change and awareness.,positive
The sessions also served as a reflection point to monitor project activities and make necessary adjustments to work plans.,positive
"The project benefited from good management and information sharing during round table discussions, and work plans were found to be in line with realities at the field level.",positive
"The project has made gains to potentially reduce the vulnerability of the beneficiary populations, mostly rural.",positive
"Communities are better equipped to deal with climate shocks equipped with the practical knowledge gained at the Artisanal Seed Producer Group, FFS and agricultural DRM. The introduction of new varieties of peas and other drought-resistant species increase indicators necessary to support the resilience of beneficiaries",positive
"he project introduced good agricultural practices, notably Farmer Field Schools, whose efficacy was clearly communicated to the government.",positive
"Its focus on functional capacities are highly relevant to the needs and priorities of targeted AIS. The project is aligned with effective development cooperation and good capacity development practices and it is seen as an attempt to fill capacity development gaps that are not usually addressed by other actors. It is therefore fully coherent with the TAP’s mandate and it represents its most important source of financing. The project is also coherent with FAO priorities and strategies (including the decision to host the TAP Secretariat), and is considered a crucial contribution to increasing the impact of FAO country portfolios. It is also well aligned and coherent with the main European Union strategies but the involvement of the European Union services during the implementation has been limited, including at country level.",positive
"It has contributed to build capacities at both individual and organizational level creating the potential for change by helping niche partnerships prioritize challenges and develop detailed action plans to address them, where capacity development interventions can make a significant difference. TAPipedia has been launched as a capacity development portal in support of the Common Framework and TAP. At least two donors are interested in funding capacity development for AIS projects in four other countries",positive
"monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) system is being put in place in pilot countries. It has the potential to deliver on accountability and learning requirements but there are concerns about whether the system can be made workable in the time available, without distracting from implementation through burdensome data gathering requirements.",positive
"Niche partnerships are one of the project’s main assets and, in general, they have helped the achievement of the project’s expected results. In some countries, the selection of niches was nevertheless influenced by political considerations and was not fully transparent or inclusive. Several countries have chosen to work with more than the two or three recommended niche partnerships with possible detrimental results through dilution of support given to each one.",positive
"Despite the project not implicitly targeting marginalized groups in its design, both indigenous and marginalized groups have benefited from the activities and will do so in the future, as members of the selected niches and through the implementation of the niche action plans. In particular, the project addressed their working conditions to some extent.",positive
he project’s monitoring and evaluation team is working on simplifying the Coaching Plan.,positive
"The project has developed the Common Framework and has contributed to develop a shared vision of capacity development for AIS, as the basis of the TAP. The country-led approach and demand-driven methodologies used for identifying capacity development needs in the pilot countries are highly appreciated",positive
"The project has put in place a challenging governance and implementation structure that, despite the difficulties and delays, has contributed to deliver some results. However, in two countries some tensions are impacting on national-level ownership of the project and its ongoing implementation",positive
The Common Framework is well aligned with the demands and priorities of TAP partners and national priorities of participating countries.,positive
The project has made good progress towards its three results.,positive
The project would not have achieved the same results if led by only one of the partners.,positive
The facilitation of FFS has been the most important activity in terms of time and money invested.,positive
"in turn, trained a total of 33 646 producers through the intermediary of 1 335 Farmer Field Schools. Other projects and programmes have trained 7 471 producers in 374 FFS; thus, bringing the total number of producers trained to 41 117 distributed throughout 1 709 FFS.",positive
"FFS, formed by 20 male and female producers who meet each week, is believed to contribute to social cohesion at a village level as a result of the intensive and sustained cooperation of members of FFS during the agricultural campaign.",positive
"The operationalization of the CCA approach was carried out in a participatory and cross-sectoral manner. It resulted in the list of good agricultural practices mentioned above. The project team has also been involved in multiple public and private development programmes and projects, which testifies to the quality of their services and ensures certain continuity of capacity in the post-project facilitation of FFS and CCA.",positive
A formal statement pertaining to the FFS approach as being a unique or favoured extension approach would allow it to become general practice in the country and would lead to better follow-up by the National Board of Agriculture and the Regional Board of Agriculture on the quality of implementation.,positive
"The project has been implemented over the period 2011-2016 according to the pre-established logical framework and it produced the expected results with regard to the development and integration of climate change adaption policies and agricultural programmes. Today, CCA is an integral part of all programmes and projects in the agricultural sector.2",positive
"municipalities (out of 708), with 413 facilitators (technicians and producers), who trained a total of 41 117 agricultural producers in 1 709, predominantly looking at dry crops and market gardening. Of these, 28 percent of facilitators and 17 percent of producers were trained by partner projects and programmes.",positive
"On the other hand, the GCP/MLI/033/LDF project made a very satisfactory effort to develop partnerships with various programmes and projects. This has resulted in partnerships with at least eight large programmes and projects: IESA, Cotton European Union, GIZ/Resilience and Nutrition, IFDC, PAFICOT, APROCA, Better Cotton Initiative and FAO/GEF Agro-pastoral. Moreover, the FFS approach was adopted by several programmes and projects in the field without a true prior consultation at national level (for example, ICRISAT, World Vision, PASSIP). In fact, the diffusion of the approach was carried out in these cases by the intermediary for FFS facilitators at field level. Regional networks of facilitators, who were supported by the project, played an important role in consolidation.",positive
he capacity of CCA and FFS has increased significantly.,positive
"CCA, FFS and IPPM approaches may well be scaled up. Many of the organizations, programmes and projects are interested in them and adopt them",positive
The GCP/MLI/033/LDF project has contributed to capacity building and food security in rural areas by integrating CCA methods and techniques and the Farmer Field School approach in the agricultural sector.,positive
"ince then, the CCA approach has been taken into account in all programmes and projects concerning agricultural development.",positive
The GCP/MLI/033/LDF project itself has significantly contributed to the identification and definition of ways and methods of adaptation.,positive
"Although the Farmer Field School approach is still not deemed to be a unique or favoured extension approach in Mali, the National Board of Agriculture urges others “to continue in the dynamic of the FFS, to adopt it, disseminate it, and to ensure that it is consistent with a mechanism that has been commonly defined.",positive
"The GCP/MLI/033/LDF project has meant that those responsible for partner organizations in the project, as well as third parties, could be well informed about CCA and FFS approaches in order to support the implementation and application of these approaches in the field.",positive
The participation of stakeholders has been satisfactory.,positive
"Ownership of the project by the country is very satisfactory in technical and operational terms, and moderately satisfactory in political and financial terms.",positive
"Approaches to the dissemination of CCA practices, including through FFS, are very strong, as are the relationships with the numerous partners.",positive
Reproducibility of the actions of the project is satisfactory.,positive
"This includes FAO interventions in policy support, nutrition, rice and oil seed, integrated pest management and food safety. Emergency and relief interventions clearly responded to government priorities.",positive
"imilarly, FAO addressed a number of priorities in the fisheries and forestry sector.",positive
"As a global Organization with a long history of delivering technical cooperation programmes in Myanmar, FAO has considerable credibility with the government. FAO is also viewed as a technical agency that provides valuable agricultural information as well as technical and policy guidance. This enabled the close alignment of mutual priorities while also helping FAO to play an important role in informing and influencing policymaking at the national level",positive
The work in community fisheries yielded significant results in this respect.,positive
build on its past success and participate more in the “resilience space” in Myanmar.,positive
The recently completed country level gender assessment study for Myanmar was a good start for further work on gender and social equity in the country.,positive
"Through its continuous engagement, FAO has played a leading role in supporting and advising the government on agriculture, rural development and food security issues. Development actors recognized FAO’s role in securing the government’s commitment to initiatives such as the National Zero Hunger Challenge. FAO’s interventions are well-aligned with national goals and priorities and broadly aligned to the United Nations Development Assistance Framework.",positive
"During 2016 and under the new government, FAO started changing this perception by working closely with the leading land sector network in Myanmar and actively including civil society in its land tenure activities.",positive
his trend seemed to be changing under the new regional leadership in the FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (RAP). FAO is gradually improving its capacity at country level.,positive
"hrough strong partnerships with the government, FAO was able to enter less accessible areas, build technical capacities of the government, respond to important disasters and reach a significant number of beneficiaries.",positive
"Through ECTAD, FAO achieved transformative results in animal transboundary disease control and prevention. The programme continuously built upon its successes to evolve from an emergency response to a resilience programme, with capacity development support in three dimensions: community level, institutions and enabling environment.",positive
"FAO is perceived as a valued institutional partner with established and effective government relationships, particularly with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Irrigation and many of its line agencies, as well as the Forestry Department, Fisheries Department and Department of Rural Development.",positive
FAO is recognized as a leader in supporting standards for country food safety.,positive
"Working in partnership with the Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department, ECTAD achieved positive results in the control and surveillance of zoonotic diseases, especially in the poultry sector.",positive
"ergency responses3 were appropriate to the needs of the Government of Myanmar, and to the type of disaster and the needs of beneficiaries.",positive
"When FAO Myanmar responded promptly to emergencies, it contributed to early recovery and in some cases prevented beneficiaries from spiralling further into poverty and indebtedness.",positive
gns of sustainability were observed in areas in which FAO Myanmar worked at both the community and national policy levels.,positive
FAO Myanmar benefitted from its proximity to the FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (RAP) and from technical assistance from FAO headquarters.,positive
"n the context of Myanmar’s sensitive social and political environment, FAO has established a solid partnership and cooperation with the government.",positive
"FAO contributed to important resilience building work through ECTAD, and contributed to decreasing vulnerabilities through its emergency responses.",positive
"Nevertheless, the project has undertaken much of the work needed to gain formal recognition of the targeted areas as protected areas.",positive
otable achievements include the Forestry Training Centre’s Biodiversity Conservation and Protected Area Management (BC&PAM) programme in Fiji and the Wakatu Fiji campaign.,positive
Most of the efforts under this output were in ecotourism and the plans should come to fruition in the coming years.,positive
"In Fiji, the project completed awareness and training programmes on sustainable forest and land management to improve the knowledge and understanding of the local communities, farmers (including youth and women) and extension officers about the benefits of SFM and SLM. In Samoa, the project supported the publication of the State of Sustainable Land Management, a comprehensive review of policies. Also, in Samoa community members and families involved in the project are benefiting",positive
"n Niue, the project supported training and developed a range of related published materials aimed at strengthening local capacity.",positive
the project recognized that men and women hold different and complimentary knowledge of the forests where the FPAM worked.,positive
The project has made a considerable effort to support gender equality and the empowerment of women. It should be complimented for the range of activities it included to empower women without compromising the culture of indigenous peoples,positive
". The project has strongly focused on local communities and customary land-owners, as is appropriate for the Pacific region. The project established very good and effective working relations with the beneficiary communities. In all the target countries, the project teams made concerted efforts to ensure that they consulted with and informed the communities and customary land owners before beginning any work, to ensure they fully understood the background to project ideas and were allowed to reach consensus and make decisions according to their customary systems of decision-making.",positive
"Nevertheless, in most countries there are projects that have taken on, or are in the process of taking on, many of the unfinished activities of the project.",positive
"however, project activities such as promoting SLM and income generating activities are enabling adaptive capacity and resilience.",positive
"The overall focus of the project remained relevant for the duration of the project, with some minor adjustment at national level to planned activities. This conclusion speaks to the overall robustness of the original design of the project given that the region (and the project) has experienced numerous severe weather events (see Appendix 12), other natural disasters, political changes (particularly in Fiji) and the fact that a long period of time elapsed between development of the original idea for the project (2007) and its final approval (2011).",positive
"Towards project closure, the project focused on discussing, planning and networking with existing and upcoming projects (inter alia GEF5) to share lessons from FPAM and ensure that these projects continue the unfinished activities in their work plans.",positive
"roject training of local community leaders as champions for biodiversity conservation was highly effective in all the project countries. The project’s support to the Fiji Forestry Training Centre to develop a Biodiversity Conservation and Protected Area Management programme, to be completed during the Fiji extension, will be a very important legacy of this project for Fiji and the other countries of the South Pacific. This highly flexible programme fills a gap in training/capacity building for school leavers, in-service training for Government and private sector staff and can be adapted for tailored short courses for community leaders/members. In achieving its global environment objective and project development objective, the project supported the publication of a wide range of important baseline and other documents and created a comprehensive online archive (146 articles in total listed in Appendix 6). These will form an important legacy of the project if they are archived securely and made available to the public.",positive
Maintaining and/or increasing interest of government agencies responsible for the affairs of customary land owners in protected area issues is likely to be a key to long-term conservation success in the Pacific. The partnership approach to delivering the project has left a positive legacy in the region.,positive
Satisfactory.,positive
"he M&E work of the project has been well-organized and has prepared all the necessary Project Implementation Reports, Project Progress Reports etc. which track project activity",positive
The project team was effective and efficient in delivering project outputs.,positive
"The project was relevant to the individual needs of each of the four target countries. The regional approach provided an opportunity for the countries to share experiences and lessons, which will be invaluable for their implementation of future GEF and other (inter alia the EU project Action Against Desertification Fiji, R2R, REDD+) projects.",positive
"The project responded to the impact of tropical cyclones by adjusting timelines and budgets and also, at times, supporting disaster relief efforts.",positive
"activities and budget proposed for the 12-month extension of the project in Fiji are relevant, likely to be effective, have the potential to achieve an impact and fit the priorities of project partners in Fiji.",positive
The project results set a very sound foundation for protected area management.,positive
"The interventions addressed aspects related to rural poverty, gender and vulnerable populations where appropriate.",positive
"he Organization’s main contribution was the provision of technical support, training and research at the field level. FAO is viewed as having strong, technical and field level expertise. This has made the Organization an important and relevant partner in resilience work",positive
"AO’s strategic focus and development priorities followed a flexible, consultative approach with the government. The CPF was pragmatic and forward-looking, and was generally well- prioritized to respond to emerging needs. The Organization’s strategic framework and the government’s core policy documents (e.g. the Five-Year Plan, National Agriculture Policy, National Food Policy, Country Investment Plan), along with the established consultative mechanism, facilitated the formulation and implementation of the CPF. Government appreciated FAO’s assistance in its formulation (environment, forest and climate change) and implementation monitoring (agriculture, food security and nutrition).",positive
"FAO interventions succeeded where there was strong government commitment, competent technical oversight, sustained resource availability and support to institutional capacity development. FAO made a distinctive contribution to food and nutrition security and food safety, in which sequenced projects provided holistic and long-term support. FAO’s successful experience working with the Ministry of Food to improve food and nutrition security is being replicated in other sectors, such as forestry and environment.",positive
"extension and public delivery system at meso and primary levels. There was clear evidence of productivity gains for beneficiaries. FAO’s programme was perceived as technically solid and contributed to capacity development and behavioural changes while being thinly spread, and the benefits at the field level were often location-specific and limited in scale.",positive
"FAO’s comparative advantage was in being a technical agency, and that reputation was well-acknowledged by the government and partner agencies. Another important role of FAO was in conveying important information and advocacy. The Organization established its reputation as an honest broker in some critical areas, including nutrition, food safety and climate-smart agriculture. FAO’s role as a resource provider was less significant in Bangladesh, where various partners with larger financial envelopes operate",positive
"Large donors continued providing resources for new projects, as FAO had lived up to its reputation as a technical agency in delivering quality programmes. Proactively initiating dialogue on issues within FAO’s technical domain, instead of responding to demand-driven requests, is critical to continuing a fruitful relationship with resource partners. In some areas (e.g. nutrition, food safety, climate-smart agriculture), FAO paved the way for policy dialogu",positive
"within the government and later played a lead role in generating partnerships, mobilizing donor resources and providing technical leadership in conceptualizing and implementing the interventions. The government expects the FAO assistance is building the capacity to formulate the projects to mobilize climate-related funds to implement the recently approved Country Investment Plan for Environment, Forestry and Climate Change.",positive
"The programme portfolio represented a judicious mix of upstream and downstream support, and the programme made noteworthy contributions at both levels.",positive
This enabled beneficiaries to to embark on agribusinesses and market development.,positive
"The programme considered some of the most significant local needs and responded with suitable interventions for good agriculture practices, irrigation development, input supply and new crop varieties.",positive
"he HLV is a useful tool for district governments, United Nations agencies, NGOs and civil society for effective disaster response. It could contribute directly to district DRM planning, and act as a baseline for contingency planning during the post-emergency response and recovery.",positive
"oughout its programme, FAO assisted the most vulnerable districts and communities, and emphasized impartiality with ethno-linguistic groups, minorities and unregistered temporarily displaced persons. The organization also supported and empowered rural women, but did not effectively target youth.",positive
AO is the organization best suited to synthesize the findings and recommendations on vulnerabilities and SDG tracing for policymakers.,positive
FAO has a strong mandate in relation to the SDGs.,positive
"UNDP, however, has assumed responsibility for improving the capacity development of SDG projects throughout the country. During the CPE visit to Karachi, UNDP had organized an awareness raising workshop on SDGs",positive
The project was implemented within budget and within a short time frame.,positive
"It contributed to FAO SO4 by improving the quality and availability of updated information and analysis, enabling government and national stakeholders to design and implement efficient and inclusive market strategies (e.g. harmonization, private stock estimation). The project also contributed to the Global AMIS third pillar by strengthening country capacities, which will improve forecasting in the future.",positive
Some aspects of these new knowledge and skills are being institutionalized and there is also evidence of improvement in the enabling environment in all three countries.,positive
nstitutional arrangements for the project ensured ownership and involvement within FAO at various levels and among government stakeholders.,positive
Decentralized institutional arrangements within FAO and oversight committees in the country have proved vital for developing project ownership and effective implementation coordination.,positive
"he ability of the project coordinator to understand and work with government processes and government stakeholders, as well as FAO’s traditional strength of working with Ministry of Agriculture, proved to be strong contributing factors to achieving results.",positive
"he Strengthening AMIS project was effective in contributing to GSARS, FAO SO4 and Global AMIS, within the envisaged boundaries of the project.",positive
"As AMIS evolved, the activities and outputs became increasingly relevant for the higher order goal.",positive
"n these cases, the content of the Market Monitor has in most cases been referred to as a trustworthy additional source of information.",positive
"t is the opinion of the majority of the respondents that this would not have been possible without the DGF funding, in addition to other in kind contributions from the international organizations. Indeed, the respondents who were knowledgeable of the DGF funding were under the impression that this financial support was instrumental in supporting the establishment of AMIS and the coordination of the activities.",positive
"e DGF deliverables were achieved and most of the targets were attained. Through the support provided by the grant, the supply of timely and relevant market information has increased. It took time and effort, but activities financed through the DGF also helped in encouraging stakeholders to increasingly participate and contribute to AMIS. This has allowed AMIS products to become progressively more accurate, relevant and appreciated",positive
"There is overall satisfaction over the convening role the Secretariat played. There is also an overall stakeholder perception that AMIS is a good example of a multilateral initiative producing concrete results for a reasonable cost. The DGF funding, by being well aligned with core AMIS needs and mobilized in a timely way, has been able to reach the Bank’s objective of “catalysing partnerships through convening and building coalitions, and raising funds”",positive
The DGF funding contributed to the development and continuous improvement of the AMIS website and its functionalities.,positive
"he Market Monitor, the AMIS website and Information Group and RRF meetings were effective tools in making the improved information available to the public.",positive
"Based on the conceptual definition of FAO’s Strategic Objective (SO) 4, and the rationale and objectives of the initiative, AMIS could be said to make important contributions towards the outcome.",positive
"By nature, the AMIS initiative is a partnership and multiple examples of synergies have been found by the evaluation team, directly aligned with and contributing to the DGF goals.",positive
The partnership for AMIS has led to harmonization of efforts between donors for the capacity building activities.,positive
The establishment of AMIS was a relevant initiative in the post-2008 food prices crisis context and there is a good satisfactory degree of alignment between the initial concept presented to the G20 and the actual initiative.,positive
"Undoubtedly, the DGF partnership was effective.",positive
The projects coordinated by the cluster represent the largest intervention in terms of scope and financial resources allocated to food safety management in Bangladesh.,positive
"There was evidence of strengthening the institutional coordination, standards and regulation setting mechanisms; technical capacities in analysis, surveillance and inspection; consumer awareness; and grassroots adoption of good practices resulting in food safety. These results are attributable to FAO interventions, which benefitted from the contribution of implementing partners.",positive
Continued capacity development and adequate financial support are needed to upscale the current benefits.,positive
There was encouraging evidence that these results could produce both technical and functional benefits. Capacity development accounted for 60–65 percent of project budgets.,positive
"The right steps are being taken toward institutionalization and governance, although much work remains.",positive
"The cluster received significant cooperation, technical backstopping and knowledge support from FAO headquarters and the regional office.",positive
There were visible results in all three outcome areas of the cluster.,positive
These institutions have been equipped with the skills to improve food safety management.,positive
"As such, these projects have made an important contribution to the implementation of the objectives of the Treaty.",positive
"This included preliminary analyses, vulnerability assessments and field trials to identify appropriate actions and target groups in both, strategic action plans and immediate action projects. As a result, all projects were found to be aligned with both the provisions of the Treaty and other international agreements and conventions including Millennium Development Goals, Convention of Biological Diversity and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",positive
"Taking into account the above- mentioned results, the evaluation considers that the immediate action projects represent good value for money, especially when average expenditure per project was USD 221 000.",positive
"However, the evaluation did identify cases where funded projects are helping to forge new alliances between farmers, NGOs and breeders in the interests of reducing dependency on traditional actors in PGRFA (namely public institutions that have diminishing resources). Immediate action projects have experienced difficulties in securing adequate funds since project closure.",positive
"Nevertheless, the evaluation found a large number of lead farmers were continuing to conserve the PGRFA promoted by the projects. Furthermore, there were cases in some of the farming communities visited in Guatemala, Malawi and Peru where crop diversity had increased and production of local varieties was actually registering higher productivity rates than at the end of the immediate action projects.",positive
"Supporting vulnerable farming communities in marginal rural areas is an effective and sustainable way of conserving PGRFA, as well as increasing the availability to facilitate its sustainable use.",positive
FAO demonstrated an ability to respond to emergencies.,positive
"The food produced was used predominantly for household consumption, with important gains on dietary quality and diversity and ability to save.",positive
However FAO is presently developing a system to monitor its activities.,positive
"he implications of this work are: i) improved policies and normative frameworks have the potential to immediately ease access or open outlets for the constrained Palestinian economy; ii) a better policy environment builds the PA’s credibility in negotiations with local and international partners, as well as with the Israeli authorities; and iii) it strengthens the Palestinian position and its authority with regard to future advancement and the peace process.",positive
"he Programme Framework has fully incorporated the current reviewed Strategic Framework 2013-2023 in its strategy, and both programming documents in the period under review are clearly linked to the corporate objective of enhancing resilience, aligning with the previous Strategic Objective I and current Strategic Objective 5. There were also some links with SO2, 3 and 4.",positive
"The country support process seems to have improved over the two years of its implementation, with a broader range of SOs supporting the office, and a higher number of requests of support being met.",positive
FAO has addressed protection mostly by supporting livelihoods and enhancing resilience in order to help people confront the consequences of the conflict and prepare them for its peaceful resolution.,positive
FAO was effective despite the difficult operating context and highly sensitive political situation.,positive
An innovative emerging trait of the WBGS programme and a lesson for FAO corporate is to address resilience by working through value chains on accessing markets.,positive
FAO’s strategy to adopt a technical approach to advocacy was appreciated by resource partners and elevated FAO’s standing among United Nations agencies. FAO’s role in coordination fora and as a leader in the sector was widely acknowledged and valued,positive
"Generally, and with some important exceptions, FAO’s knowledge-oriented assistance on CCAM has consisted of the agency carrying out the analysis or producing the data, with minimal participation of the member countries and the development of their capacities in these areas. This is especially noteworthy considering that capacity development in CCAM data and knowledge generation is a high priority for member countries according to a survey conducted of them for the evaluation.",positive
"However, few of these interventions were designed to address longer term climate change adaptation in an innovative way. Give the financial limitations of the Organization, they also had limited geographic reach, only a small subset of communitylevel projects used information on climate projections and evidence of adaptation or mitigation success, and showed upscaling prospects and influence on policy.",positive
"An analysis of FAO’s Strategic Objectives (SOs) 2 and 5, under which the agency’s CCAM and climate-related DRR work largely falls, finds that according to various evidence sources the SO Outputs align to the elements needed for national-level CCAM readiness in the area of knowledge and data, and to some of those for governance, policy and strategy.",positive
"The agency has also moved emergency and DRR measures further in the direction of long-term adaptation in these and other countries through the coordination of and influence on coordination clusters that are typically set up in emergency responses. In Africa, FAO has provided guidance for mainstreaming CCAM into programmes at the regional and subregional levels. In the Haiyan response, mainstreaming adaptation was difficult due to the sudden onset of the disaster, short-term nature of the projects, and lack of clarity on how the resilience concept was to be applied at field level, but was achieved to a notable degree.",positive
"n terms of formal partnerships with the sector for CCAM financing, which will be necessary to meet global climate-related challenges, FAO has developed a few recent initiatives and is exploring additional opportunities.",positive
"The evaluation found that FAO has a number of unique strength in CCAM. Its comparative advantages include: i) providing member countries with highly valued technical support, information and tools; ii) helping government agencies and other partners to harmonize climate change and DRR policies and strategies; and iii) acting as a trusted facilitator and neutral source of technical data among global climate-related institutions and forums.",positive
"As a neutral observer to the UNFCCC, FAO has provided technical information at the sessions, in meetings, side events and documents. While this knowledge has been of use, and FAO is regarded as a trusted body",positive
"While the agency has brought value in the areas of climate finance and implementing practices as well, there is room for improvement, particularly in strengthening institutions’ capacities to implement climate change and DRR activities.",positive
"FAO has largely pursued adaptation and mitigation separately from one another in its range of CCAM interventions. Member countries, while being interested in how mitigation and adaptation can benefit each other, have done the same and placed greater priority on adaptation. Hence using CSA as a flexible, overarching framework that encompasses all of FAO’s CCAM work, rather than as an approach that member countries might perceive as on which necessarily includes mitigation, has been useful in this regard",positive
"Major achievements were identified in relation to Uganda’s participation in climate change fora at the international, national, parliamentary, ministerial, local government and farmer levels. The evaluation team found a high level of awareness of climate change, its manifestation and consequences, and what is required of stakeholders at different levels in order to appropriately respond to its most adverse effects.",positive
"he enhanced opportunities provided unfettered access to water for livestock production, whether as a private good or a common property resource, and are starting to result in both increased livestock production and the diversification of pastoralists’ enterprises focused on the livestock value chain – especially milk and milk- based products. Increased availability of and access to water for crop farming has made it possible for beneficiary communities to more easily adopt climate smart crop cultivation. As a result, not only has production increased, but small-scale irrigation systems have also been adopted and extensive cultivation of different types of crops undertaken year-round in places where this was previously considered untenable.",positive
A total of 15 new valley tanks were constructed and five existing tanks rehabilitated through the project.,positive
"e project has also contributed to establishing Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs) among FFS groups. The resulting access to loans from the VSLAs was a major contributing factor to increased production and productivity levels during the project period. Likewise, the project led to an increase in the land area covered by tree vegetation, which has a positive impact on the micro-climate in those areas with bio-energy plantations; moreover, beneficiaries have acquired the skills to establish and manage tree nurseries and tree planting as private business enterprises.",positive
"Afterward, women have progressively become more committed than men to attend FFS and implement the practices learned. Positive gender results were observed particularly in relation to the coffee production activities, where men and women are now sharing planning and working tasks more equitably, both in the field and within their families.",positive
The project funding provided by the European Union and Belgium presents an excellent example of alignment and complementarity within donor funding. Although the project has benefitted from having locally represented implementing partners on board,positive
Positive results have started to emerge and the most progress was made in relation to coffee plantations. The needs and concerns of vulnerable groups like youth and children were addressed by the project indirectly.,positive
"There were some indications that the project is likely to improve food security, nutrition and livelihood conditions.",positive
he GCCA project has successfully applied different mechanisms for the selection of project partners based on comparative strengths and their particular role in the project.,positive
The project made an important contribution by highlighting Uganda’s position among the leading countries in Africa undertaking CCA and building resilience.,positive
"Recently, the project has actively promoted gender equality in the access to knowledge and capacities aimed at increasing resilience to cope with climate change.",positive
"Moreover, research on the drivers of FNS in context was an innovative programme design element of FSPS-CB, which contributed to context-sensitive and improved design of stakeholder interventions. There was a clear indication that the FNS strategy development research could have produced excellent policy and strategy results had it been started earlier. The task forces and researchers expressed optimism that these efforts will be beneficial to improving FNS outcomes in the coming years.",positive
"Nevertheless, responsive policy actions to the information that was produced by SFSTS did take place and likely had a positive local impact, particularly in Blue Nile and Gedaref State.",positive
"Fundamental changes in institutional setup and capacity have been established that favor integrated, evidence-based and inclusive FNS policies.",positive
Good coordination was directly linked to the improved quality of information products; dramatic improvements in FSPS coordination at state level can be directly attributed to FSPS-CB activities.,positive
Research that brought together academia with FNS stakeholders produced policy action at state level.,positive
The FSPS-CB promoted FNS policy action at state level.,positive
FSPS information products and coordination will continue to be of value in the future.,positive
The evaluation team found that research on drivers of FNS in context was an innovative programme design element of FSPS-CB.,positive
The evaluation team found evidence of policy action in the four states.,positive
Overall capacity for FNS policy and strategy has improved.,positive
This analysis shows that challenges to FNS policy were reduced over the life of the programme.,positive
"Building government capacity to manage irrigation rehabilitation activities remains important. Similarly, involving beneficiaries in these activities from the outset, and training them to operate and maintain their irrigation infrastructure continues to be the appropriate approach to irrigation rehabilitation",positive
Continuous support from all levels of MEW to the programme was also an important contributing factor to effective results. Coordination and decision-making arrangements among partners were adequate.,positive
"he results also helped reduce disputes between individuals and communities due to water access problems. The new structures also reduced the amount of time and resources that farmers needed to allocate for rebuilding and maintaining their irrigation canals. The projects trained farmers and Mirabs in more efficient water management, operations and maintenance. The programme helped building the capacity of MEW to take over responsibility for all activities in canal rehabilitation projects.",positive
"implementation, while also integrating Kapisa province into work plans. Project teams adeptly worked through problems in order to maintain sub-project schedules and budgets",positive
"The main factor contributing to achievement of intended outcomes was the competence of project teams to operate in difficult, often unstable and insecure working environments.",positive
"Rehabilitation of irrigation and water control structures, and capacity building of government officials and beneficiaries delivered effective results, with downstream communities obtaining the most benefit through more equitable distribution of water allowing them to increase their land under irrigation and increase their productivity.",positive
Competent project teams able to work effectively in difficult operational environments and continuous support from all levels of MEW were the main factors contributing to effective outcomes.,positive
"All four project components, and particularly component 4, contributed to significantly strengthening technical and managerial capacity in participating institutions. A notable achievement was the introduction of the Ecosystems Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM) to national and local stakeholders, which resulted in a new generation of EAFM-trained local fisheries officers in the region. A major outcome of the project that was not envisaged during the project design was the strengthened capacity of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center (SEAFDEC) to coordinate large-scale regional projects, technically support regional trawl fisheries projects, and provide EAFM training and training of trainers at the regional leve",positive
"The project generated valuable lessons and experiences from the pilot sites, particularly the Samar Sea site which has become a model for trawl fisheries management, EAFM and public-private partnerships. While some replication was taking place in targeted countries by the end of the project, sharing the project results more widely among the countries and in the region would increase the potential for replication.",positive
"Despite the various implementation challenges, the project made contributions towards achieving the GEO and PDO and delivered results that were highly valued by FAO and the countries.",positive
"The project resulted in capacity developments of SEAFDEC, which will serve to support improvements in fisheries management in the future.",positive
"ome gender initiatives have been undertaken, including the employment of a gender specialist and considerable training of FSNAU staff in Nairobi and Somalia. As a result, a higher level of mainstreaming in FSNAU is expected in the future, including more female enumerators.",positive
Members of the Food Security Cluster (approximately 90-100) depended on the seasonal assessments for their emergency response. The data was also used for monitoring and validation of targeting. The nutrition data was used extensively by the partners of the Nutrition Cluster (105 partners,positive
"The livelihood baseline reports were used for programming, food security analysis and early warning response. Given the current funding gap and the fact that the assessments should ultimately be manageable by Somali government institutions, the evaluation found that the rezoning was a correct decision.",positive
he other three priority areas were all highly important and have been achieved. The communication strategy was also relevant and has strengthened the four priorities.,positive
"Excellent initiatives have been undertaken with regard to gender, including the preparation of the Standard Operating Procedures for Integrating Gender into FAO Somalia Programme, a new classification of households which is likely to lead to more accurate data and analysis.",positive
"A large majority of the respondents (86 percent) indicated that FSNAU information products made a contribution to their knowledge of food security, nutrition and livelihood issues in Somalia, whereas 5 percent indicated that it has not contributed to their knowledge of these issues.",positive
t founded the IPC and is the main provider of food security and nutrition information and analysis for Somalia. While FSNAU information products are widely used and appreciate,positive
"FSNAU plays an important role as the main provider of food security and nutrition information and analysis for emergency response, and to a lesser extent for development programming in Somalia.",positive
Most projects were designed to respond to Government priorities.,positive
"Although the projects did not benefit from the Gender Officer at the Regional Office, the FAO guidance materials were available to the projects and the Programme Coordination Unit.",positive
"his training will help MoEWA to improve disease control programmes, reduce the risk of disease transmission and facilitate early disease detection and action. Taken together, these activities will help to upgrade the veterinary health delivery system in KSA so that it complies with international standards set by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and FAO. Likewise, the environmental rehabilitation projects made significant progress.",positive
"At the technical level, the design included capacity building of staff and beneficiaries through workshops and study tours. At the functional level, the projects were planned to create enabling environments by recommending strategies and policie",positive
"The Technical Cooperation Assistance is well aligned with KSA’s agricultural sector priorities, as defined in the National Development Plans.",positive
"he programme design was in line with the vision, strategy and development plans of the Kingdom, and most projects were designed to respond to Government priorities.",positive
The Programme Coordination Unit supported the projects to the extent possible.,positive
FAO’s work is often viewed locally as integrated with the Ministry’s. This is a significant strength.,positive
"However, the programme strongly focused on technical issues at the expense of socioeconomic ones, and included almost no policy advice.",positive
e Organization was flexible in adapting in response to internal and external demands.,positive
The current Country Programming Framework largely reflects the strategic objectives of the Organization and addresses key development issues of the country.,positive
The FAO country programme has rightly recognized the need to include rural poverty and gender aspects as priority areas for cooperation.,positive
FAO interventions have largely been appropriate to support the Country Programming Framework.,positive
"The country programme has made successful contributions in several areas, including at policy, organizational and field levels.",positive
"rder to ensure responsiveness and alignment with national, United Nations and FAO planning processes, FAO made several changes to the Country Programming Framework and its related programmes.",positive
"he project adapted to institutional changes at country level, as the government counterpart department transitioned into the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Furthermore, improvements in project design and management were implemented following the Mid-term Review recommendations.",positive
The project focused on technical skills necessary for primary production. This approach has its merits in view of the well-documented production challenges facing smallholder farmers in South Africa.,positive
The project made efforts to adapt to South Africa’s shifting priorities by refocusing the project from regional to national capacity development under Component I.,positive
"FAO successfully applied its core competency as a facilitator, bringing government and academic parties together to broker the establishment of the Institute for Development Assistance Management (IDAM). The institute has since become a flagship initiative.",positive
"For Component I, FAO brought multiple stakeholders together to ensure the establishment of the Institute for Development Assistance Management.",positive
"e skills were also transferred from the women trainees to community farmers. This means that women are acting as informal extension workers in the community, which was a role previously filled only by men.",positive
he participants developed individual capacities to prepare a logframe of the project and make meaningful comments on the FSN strategy.,positive
"The capacities of other ministries were also improved, including the Ministry of Health.",positive
"s a result, the Afghanistan Food and Nutrition Security Agenda (AFSANA), which is a key policy and strategic framework for food and nutrition security, was agreed and endorsed by the office of the second Vice President. A food and nutrition security planning and implementation manual was prepared and submitted for endorsement by MAIL.",positive
"The capacity of taskforce group members was enhanced in terms of (i) making quality comments on FSN Strategy and Planning and Implementation Manual, and holding discussions more focused on specific problems; and (ii) preparing logframes for FSN. The capacity of the M&E system was improved for collecting FSN data, managing the database, as guided by the result frame, and analysing policy gaps at the ministry.",positive
"Extension workers are now better equipped and have better knowledge and skills with which to address the FSN issues of farmers through supervision and guidance to CIGs. A district development plan was developed, bringing related stakeholders together based on the baseline information in the project districts. The plan is more realistic than before, as it was planned based on recent statistics and with participatory demand driven planning implementation and monitoring.",positive
"here was better centre-province/district coordination than before. DAIL and DRRD were found to be working together in the district as service providers. The strengthened coordination contributed to plan, initiate and implement some joint activities for the improved household food security and nutrition.",positive
"e cluster has carried out a number of capacity development efforts – such as FSN policy development, issues and concepts; M&E; and FSN analysis – which enhanced the knowledge and skills of MAIL and FSN stakeholders, enabling them to contribute to the FSN policy development process. As a result, without the full-time engagement of an international expert they were able to facilitate the policy process for relevant policy and strategy development work; and carry out their respective work in relation to analysing, planning and designing various FSN programmes.",positive
There has been increased knowledge and skill development for women in mushroom farming and technology transfer of mushroom cultivation.,positive
"he government is paying the salaries, office, vehicle, etc. of the Secretariat. The Secretariat has five core staff (national coordinator, M&E officer, technical staff, and administrator) and two vehicles. The SUN Movement in Sierra Leone is organized within five networks: Government, Civil Society Organizations, Business, Donors and UN System. UNICEF is the focal point and FAO is the alternate focal point. According to the informants, the project has been instrumental in revitalizing the stalled UN-network activities and ensuring current functionality.",positive
"An example of the work of the SUN secretariat is the Position Paper on inclusion of RtF in the national constitution. Due to the high level of political support (President/Vice-president levels) to the SUN Secretariat combined with the extensive buy-in from relevant stakeholders (MAFFS, MoHS, UN agencies, NGOs, etc.), it is very likely that the Secretariat will be sustainable beyond the lifetime of the project. Hence, the project was only one out of several stakeholders being involved in and supporting the establishment and consolidation of the Secretariat.",positive
"MAFFS (through Women in Agriculture and Nutrition, WIAN) is for instance now planning to have nutritionists in all districts (there are 13 districts in the country). So far, one nutritionist has been employed in Western Area. Moreover, FNS is now gradually being integrated at policy/ program level. At district level there is also an increased understanding of the importance of food based approaches as interviews carried out during the evaluation witnessed about. The inclusion of a budget for nutrition in MAFFS in one of the visited districts, Kambia (however small) indicates an enhanced capacity for pro-actively using this understanding at a political level. At community level, the Mother-to-Mother Support groups and the school gardens illustrate increased capacity in terms of enhanced understanding and practical application of FNS, in particular dietary diversity.",positive
"Moreover, through the financial and technical support to the reactivation of the platform: Sierra Leone Alliance against Hunger and Malnutrition (SLAAHM), the project contributed to increased dialogue and collaboration between institutions and organizations working with FNS. The SLAAHM organization was officially launched in 2006",positive
"he shift from the initially planned nutrition and communication strategy to FBDG was a very important and strategic decision. All the interviewed stakeholders emphasized the importance of the FBDG, including the Task Force, and considered the FBDG to be a very critical tool. The FBDG has potential for having big national impact; i.e. improving the nutritional status of the population. Hence there is some indication that the FBDG might influence the national production strategies towards diversity of crops and vegetables",positive
"Graduates, who later will be working as district or block extension workers or who will be working in e.g. MAFFS or NGOs, will have FNS and RTF capacity; at the same time the extension workers working at the ground (field extension workers) will also have capacity in these areas. Both levels are necessary for successful FNS and RTF activities.",positive
"At the same time, all the interviewed external stakeholders, MAFFS, MoHS, the Sun Secretariat, etc. highly appreciated the mainstreaming of FNS and RtF into the BSc curriculum.",positive
"As a consequence of the enhanced understanding of having a nutritionist, the extension service (under WIAN) employed a nutritionist (June/July 2016). The MAFFS Extension Division is furthermore planning to place one nutritionist in each district. At the time of the mission, one nutritionist had been stationed in headquarter (employed in 2015) and one nutritionist had been stationed in the Western Area District Office (employed in March 2016). The other districts have MAFFS nutrition focal persons.",positive
"he project contributes directly to the implementation of the Smallholder Commercialization Programme (SCP) and furthermore contributed to the preparation of its successor, the Inclusive Comprehensive Agricultural Development Programme (ICADEP) 2015-2018. With regard to the ICADEP. The project was one of the lead agencies in the process and was represented in all working groups; the project team also reviewed the ICADEP’s general content in order to make the programme FNS and RtF sensitive.",positive
"he specific needs of women (and children) are promoted at policy, programme, and campaign level. Seconding a nutritionist to WIAN section under the Extension Division in MAFFS has been instrumental in raising awareness of nutrition in the Ministry, but it has also contributed to strengthening the gender aspect of food and nutrition security. Hence training has been conducted of women farmer groups, training on food utilization, etc. Mainstreaming nutrition into national agricultural policies implicitly has a gender aspect as women are being singled out as particularly vulnerable. With regard to the community level activities, the majority of the targeted farmers are women (e.g. in the Mother-to-Mother support groups).",positive
"he assistance from the HQ was found very useful by the project team, who also showed great interest in strengthening the link to the RtF team at HQ. The project team and the RtF team have",positive
"ucceeding the transfer of the project management to RAF, some collaboration took place between the two parties, mainly in the form of the project serving as a model to be up scaled in Africa. This included for instance the incorporation of FNS and RtF into government programmes, curriculum of university degrees; and extension service. Moreover, the work with the Pan African Parliamentarians, initiated by the project, is now being replicated in other African countries.",positive
"One of the key factors of the success of the project was the timely launch of the project – i.e. the project was launched at a time when there was a growing national interest in the importance of nutrition-sensitive agriculture. This was for example reflected in the high level of commitment of all stakeholders: MAFFS, MoHS, Njala University, other development partners, NGOs, etc.",positive
"At output level, much has been achieved, yet the district coordination mechanism are not yet fully functional; the FBDG has been prepared and validated, however, the dissemination and training of various stakeholders have not been achieved. With regard to the inclusion of FNS and RtF in pre-service and in-service training of extension workers, the pre-service curriculum is in plac",positive
The placement in the Vice-president’s Office is important as it indicates the prominence of the SUN Secretariat; the government ownership is furthermore pivotal for the sustainability of the Secretariat.,positive
"The project (through REACH) provided funding for the SUN Secretariat, totally 60.000 dollars; in addition, the project provided funding and technical assistance to the finalization, validation and launching of the Sierra Leone Food and Nutrition Security Implementation Plan (co-funded with WFP).",positive
"The Secretariat generally serves its objectives of coordinating of FNS activities and advocacy to policy makers, etc. at national level",positive
"National, district and community level capacity has been increased with regard to an enhanced understanding of FNS and ability to apply this in practice. In MAFFS, there is now a growing understanding of nutrition and the need for dietary diversity",positive
The pre-service inclusion of FNS and RtF in the BSc curriculum at Njala University is highly strategic and important for future mainstreaming of nutrition into agriculture.,positive
"All the university staff interviewed during the mission, i.e. the Vice-Chancellor, the registrar, the Dean of the School of Agriculture and the lecturers, expressed a high level of commitment, ownership and enthusiasm in relation to the new curriculum",positive
The handing over of the training to the GAFSP is commendable in light of the phasing out of the project. The GAFSP phases out in December 2016.,positive
"he Agricultural Extension Division Service (Division code 40106) now has a budget line for nutrition. In 2015, the allocated budget was 134 mill. Leone; in 2016 the allocated budget increased to 160 mill. Leone.",positive
"The Vice-president accepted the request and has been championing for the RtF to government officials in other African countries. Presumably as a result of this, the Pan-African Parliament President on behalf of the Pan African Parliament",positive
"Despite the fact that the project does not have an explicitly elaborated gender strategy, the project has strategically and practically made significant achievements with regard to mainstreaming gender into nutrition.",positive
"Overall, the achieved results appear satisfactory and in some areas also commendable (e.g. FBDG), given the disruption and delay caused by the EVD.",positive
nsiderable change was still in the pipeline after the Timor-Leste project closed and during the no-cost extension of the Indonesia project.,positive
"Effective partnerships were established between non-governmental organizations (NGO), government agriculture extension workers and farmer groups, and the transfer of CA knowledge was effective.",positive
"Qualitative data obtained through interviews show that CA improves income, food security and resilience to drought, although CA is too recent in most areas to quantify this.",positive
"Where individual women were supported by the two projects to become public advocates for CA, this appeared to have raised their public profile and confidence and contributed to increased participation by other women in those communities.",positive
"There was significant capacity development in both CA and the Farmer Field Schools (FFS) methodology at individual farmer and farmer group level, and also among individual government extension, NGO and FAO staff.",positive
Training by the project has spread knowledge of CA to government extension departments and other organizations.,positive
esearch involvement from the start in Timor-Leste provided validation of CA for policy inclusion.,positive
"CA has benefits for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction, and there were observed and documented cases of increased production, soil moisture conservation during drought, reduction in soil erosion, increased soil fertility, reduction in labour and reduction of input costs. The two projects have contributed to improve capacities of communities and key stakeholders to implement good practices to reduce the impacts of threats and crises.",positive
Considerable awareness of CA has been built at many levels in both countries.,positive
"At state level relationships between FAO and government are strong, bolstered by a range of capacity development activities.",positive
"he rapid revision of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis, released in early January 2014, provided much-needed data and information on the unfolding humanitarian crisis, establishing early on FAO’s leadership in food security analysis. The IPC, an inclusive process, has continued to influence the narrative on the humanitarian consequences of the crisis. The FAO Representative played an influential and strategic leadership role within the wider international aid community, bolstered by high- level support from Rome. And FAOSS ensured that livelihood support was placed center- stage in the humanitarian response from the outset, through the ELRP launched early in 2014, and in the multi-sectoral Crisis Response Plan.",positive
"FAOSS is uniquely placed to play a strategic leadership role in promoting cross-border trade in livestock and cereals with South Sudan’s neighbours, including Sudan, in collaboration with FAO offices in those neighbouring countries.",positive
This would be welcomed by many eg by NGO staff. On the one hand FAOSS appears willing and ready to step into this role,positive
"t quickly produced an updated IPC in January 2014, re-oriented the AFIS project to the change in context, and rapidly designed and launched the ELRP, adopting a programme approach. FAOSS learned from FAO Somalia’s experience of scaling up rapidly in response to the 2011 famine, and to some extent drew upon the knowledge and experience of some of its national staf",positive
"n Greater Upper Nile, for example, it distributed short cycle vegetable seeds that could be grown close to the homestead and could improve nutrition. Feedback from beneficiaries indicated they generally welcomed the fishing and vegetable kits more than the crop kits",positive
"The seed multiplication projects implemented in 2014 and 2015 could be better linked to seed marketing or ITFs. Some of the crops (vegetables) distributed in the ELRP kits were not known to farmers and therefore not used, especially in the absence of extension support",positive
"Reduced seasonal movement of livestock due to the conflict affirms the relevance of FAO’s past efforts to improve access to water and its plans to improve livestock feed through Agro-Pastoral Field Schools (APFS). Other livestock activities proposed for the APFSs, such as improved milk hygiene and draught animal power also appear to be appropriate, although implementation of the APFSs are still at an early stage.",positive
AFIS has usefully connected nutrition and food security actors in South Sudan.,positive
Particularly effective examples include the distribution of fishing kits and ITFs.,positive
"This provides the foundation for a wider APFS in the future. Interviews with beneficiaries indicate FFS have positively impacted knowledge and agricultural practices. FFS are currently supported with one season of learning, which is fine for basic agronomic practices but needs to be extended for more elaborate farming practices relevant to building farmers’ resilience, such as conservation agriculture",positive
"Ps have widely appreciated the technical training, enabling some to receive grants from other donors. Staff based in Juba have mainly participated, although more state-level training is being rolled out in 2016.",positive
"The distribution of fishing kits has contributed to fishing becoming an important component of food security, through direct consumption and income generation. The distribution of vegetables seeds and nutrition vouchers appears to have led to nutritional benefits. Having now established its M&E function, FAO should invest in more rigorous impact monitoring to inform its programming, accountability to funders, and to support its technical leadership role",positive
FAO has also made efforts to promote gender sensitivity amongst its IPs. This is a good foundation to build upon.,positive
"selection process for IPs improved in 2015 compared with 2014, taking account of performance as well as geographical location. FAO’s IPs generally appreciate the relationship with FAO, especially the high quality technical support and learning aspect",positive
"FAOSS has also played a leadership role in co-coordinating the Food Security and Livelihoods (FSL) cluster, with generally positive feedback from NGOs and donor members.",positive
Many components of the ELRP were highly relevant to the parts of South Sudan and communities worst affected by the crisis.,positive
This improved in 2015 when FAO took the bold and appropriate initiative to contract and coordinate a separate air operation to deliver livelihood kits to areas inaccessible by road in Greater Upper Nile. This proved highly effective,positive
"FAOSS has built a strong FFS programme, applying FFS principles to the way training is provided, cascaded from master trainers to facilitators to farmers.",positive
FAO has given consideration to sustainability through FFS and its seed multiplication activities on the crop production side.,positive
"FAOSS has drawn on experience and learning from elsewhere in the region, and in a number of ways has demonstrated commitment to learning and improving its work.",positive
he relationship is especially strong with CARICOM and the OECS Secretariats. Coordination with the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI) and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) has improved at the regional leve,positive
"FAO’s comparative advantage in different technical areas is positively recognized. Interviewed government stakeholders expressed strong satisfaction with FAO’s technical support, and particularly appreciated FAO’s knowledge about FNS, pest and disease management, livestock, and information systems development. In plant and animal health, FAO’s capacity to source the best worldwide experts on specific pests is much appreciated and relied upon. FAO is a partner agency in the Caribbean Plant Health Directors’ Forum and has been supporting the Caribbean Veterinary Network, both of which are formally recognized by CARICOM and the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) as the bodies providing technical guidance on plant and animal health, respectively, at the regional level. Respected experts were also engaged for the preparation of training materials or business plans for new national value chains.",positive
"They appreciate the new management style, which is more hands-on and responsive than before. FAO is considered today as much more approachable, responsive, timely and useful for OECS and Barbados than under the previous leadership, which was described as more passive. This dynamic is aligned with the efforts of the Secretary General to transform FAO into an organization that is more responsive to countries’ needs",positive
owever the determined effort to reach out to resource partners has led to an expansion of the portfolio beyond TCPs.,positive
"Farmer organizations in the Eastern Caribbean are often small, new and not always very cohesive, but are generally seen as a promising avenue to reach economies of scale in produce commercialization and extension.",positive
"with the exception of a recent project on Youth In Agriculture, and the engendering of census and statistical data (e.g. in St. Lucia)",positive
"The various Ministries of Agriculture met by the mission have taken on the challenge to support more diversified value chains in agriculture, with a view to increase food exports, reduce the regional food import bill, and improve nutrition.",positive
"The OECS revised its Regional Plan of Action for Agriculture in 2012 to align it to the CARICOM RFNSP, and in the years that followed the nations of the region all either developed country-level food and nutrition policies, or revised earlier ones to reflect the RFNSP in their national policy framework with FAO assistance.",positive
"he ZHC, launched in Antigua and Barbuda in 2012, is being replicated by most other countries in the region with support from FAO. Many of the countries covered by this evaluation have made valuable efforts to update and publish their dietary guidelines, improve school meals, pilot school gardening, and link smallholders to primary or secondary schools, often with FAO support. Such support to school feeding is relatively new for FAO, and highly relevant",positive
"There is also some degree of support for the idea of processing cassava mash and flour for bakery products, as a way to replace some of the imported wheat flour and thus reduce the food import bill. The idea of a composite bread appears attractive to many stakeholders,",positive
"he support offered by FAO to the agriculture census and MIS is relevant as a way to promote the importance of the sector within governments, but also to link up producers, retailers and consumers.",positive
"This issue is progressively being addressed through the Caribbean Plant Health Directors Forum and also CAHFSA, both of which FAO supports.",positive
A recently approved GEF-funded project on Climate Change Adaptation in the Eastern Caribbean Fisheries will soon help to address some of those needs.,positive
"FAO played an instrumental role is assessing damages and appropriately sponsored efforts to clear major drainage collectors and rivers in St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines from accumulated vegetation, debris and logs to facilitate drainage at the farm level. This helped beneficiaries resolve a real problem that was effectively beyond their means. In St. Lucia, some financial assistance was provided to farmers to clear smaller on-farm drains. In St Vincent, the response also generated short-term employment through cash-for-work. The experience offers useful lessons for supporting efforts around preparedness, response, and early recovery. Over and above the punctual response to the 2013 Christmas rains, the systematic maintenance of drain collectors and rivers represents both a sine qua non and a relatively “low-hanging fruit” for DRM in the region.",positive
"Guided by a renewed strategic framework and a coherent vision for the Caribbean sub-region, FAO has demonstrated its capacity to address the long-term priorities of the OECS and Barbados, and to respond rapidly to their emerging needs. Furthermore, FAO has occasionally inspired the countries to take on new challenges, such as food security and nutrition.",positive
"Due to the limited staff and financial resources available to the SLC, agriculture should remain a primary focus.",positive
"FAO is well respected by other development partners in the region, a preeminent member of the UN Country Team, and has long worked in collaboration with most regional institutions active in its domain of competence.",positive
"ven the short deadlines and lack of precise guidance from headquarters, the tendency in the OECS has been to develop documents whose programmatic sections remain short and succinct.",positive
"Overall, the programme implemented by FAO in Barbados and the OECS is aligned with national goals and priorities, and responsive to emerging country needs.",positive
"Finally, FAO’s response to the December 2013 “Christmas rains” in St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines was adequately aimed at relieving systemic, watershed-level drainage problems",positive
FAO is uniquely positioned to contribute to the revitalization of agriculture and the eradication of hunger in the OECS and Barbados.,positive
"e project was designed in consultation with the relevant departments of MAF to address their specific information and capacity development needs for the establishment of an information system able to provide reliable, timely and updated food security information to decision makers.",positive
he information generated by NIEWS has proven to be useful for making decisions related to food security.,positive
"For instance, information provided by the NIEWS led to the revision and modification of the 2005 Food Security Policy to be approved by the Council of Ministers. In addition, NIEWS products have been used to identify priority activities to be included in the Zero Hunger National Action Plan, launched in July 2014. Furthermore, based on the information provided by the Food Security Bulletin on the alarming rice imports rates and on the recommendations provided by the KONSSANTIL Technical Working Group, the Government issued a Decree Law in relation to rice imports in early 2015, avoiding a negative impact on local rice production.",positive
"he political willingness and financial viability should contribute to the strengthening of the NIEWS system, which is of utmost importance to generate relevant and timely information on food security and nutrition at national and district level.",positive
he project was efficiently managed by the project team and received adequate technical backstopping from FAO.,positive
"en though it is too soon to see longterm changes as a result of the project, the NIEWS has indeed contributed to some intermediate outcomes.",positive
"The NIEWS project has succeeded in establishing and consolidating partnerships with a broad network of institutions engaged in food security, nutrition and climate change in Timor- Leste.",positive
The project has established a well-designed and efficient information system which adequately addresses the specific needs and context of the Timor-Leste government.,positive
The strong training component of the project has enabled the start-up and smooth implementation of NIEWS.,positive
"ENAF, on the other hand, still has the opportunity to strengthen the engagement with other actors beyond universities.",positive
"NAF is in its early stages of implementation, and preparation is well underway.",positive
"Both ENAF and ENACT made efficient use of their financial resources, resulting in good value for money.",positive
Four out of five outputs were achieved related to the production and piloting of ENACT.,positive
The nutrition education approach of ENACT and ENAF was found relevant and consistent in addressing the needs identified in the NEAC survey.,positive
"FAO GRFA documents have had an international impact: citation analysis shows that in close to 100 FAO member countries, academic publications have cited key FAO GRFA policy documents. With regard to global policy processes, FAO GRFA documents were cited in five (out of 20) Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) working documents during the 2007-2010 CBD ABS negotiation period11.",positive
"Moreover, indicators developed by the Commission are used in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2.5, and guidelines developed in support of national GPA implementation have helped countries in developing national policies. However, FAO’s GRFA work lacks sufficient resources (e.g. there is very limited GRFA expertise in decentralized offices) to provide in-country and regional policy coordination and leadership.",positive
"This is in line with the intentions of FAO’s policy and normative documents, particularly the flagship policy documents, the Global Plans of Action.",positive
"n 2007, only two SOWs existed: the first State of the World report on PGR dated back to 1996, and the first AnGR SOW had just been issued. By late 2015, three additional SOWs (the second PGR, first FGR and second AnGR) had been finalized, and the Commission’s membership had grown from 170 to 178 members. (Two additional SOWs – Aquatic Genetic Resources and Biodiversity – are being finalized.)",positive
"his is most evident with regard to farmers’ rights, as well as the role of women and youth in maintaining GRFA. AnGR work recognized diversity, for example, by stressing the importance of traditional herders and women as guardians of domestic animal diversity (2007); PGR work likewise stressed the contribution of smallholder farmers to GRFA conservation and management. An evolution on this theme is evident over time: the 2007 AnGr GPA did not mention gender; the 2011 2nd PGR GPA did so extensively; the 2013 FGR GPA acknowledged in its Strategic Priorities the important role of indigenous people and local communitie",positive
"These normative products are especially useful for informing lower and middle income countries on the current GRFA situation, as well as developments governing the exchange of information and the transfer of GRFA. FAO’s GRFA information systems are crucial resources enabling stakeholders to access and share information.",positive
here was also a clear consensus among stakeholders that the SOW country reports provide an impetus for collecting and maintaining GRFA data at the country level. Guidelines developed in support of national GPA implementation have helped countries in developing national policies.,positive
"FAO GRFA documents were used17 in the Access and Benefit Sharing negotiations (2007-2010) of the CBD, and cited in nearly 100 academic publications. Also as the result of work done by the Commission, GRFA products are mentioned in global frameworks such as the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 of the Convention, the Aichi Biodiversity Target 13, and SDG Goal 2.5, all of which relate to the conservation and sustainable use of GRFA.",positive
"FAO papers and guidance documents increasingly promote farmers’ rights, emphasize the role of women and youth in maintaining GRFA, and recognize the importance of traditional societies, women, smallholder farmers and indigenous people to GRFA conservation and management.",positive
"n addition, and because of the work done by the Commission, GRFA is mentioned in global frameworks such as the CBD’s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the related Aichi Biodiversity Target 13, which relates to the conservation and sustainable use of GRFA.",positive
FAO successfully linked its GRFA work to other normative and global policy work within the Organization.1,positive
"Technical units have established informal as well as formal relations with several organizations. In addition, partnerships with important donors (France, Germany, Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland) provide funding for GRFA events (e.g. meetings related to the Commission) as well as for technical assistance projects, often in support of SOW (and, to a lesser extent, GPA) activities",positive

"FAO has established a number of formal and informal partnerships involving GRFA activities. Within the Organization, FAO has linked its GRFA work to other normative and global policy work, and created synergies between CGRFA and FAO’s technical work",positive
"There was little overlap or duplication of GRFA work either within or outside FAO. FAO has established a number of partnerships on GRFA, such as joint work plans between the Secretariats of the CBD and CGRFA",positive
"CAHWs in particular were mentioned as providing important services that, unlike before, could now be easily accessed at the village level. The recently published Impact Assessment of the CAHW Intervention in Dolow indicates that CAHWs are having a positive impact on communities. Data gathered indicates that CAHWs are accessing drugs and services through linkages to the South-West Livestock Professional Association (SOWELPA, supported by FAO) agro-vets; are charging fees for services and drugs, and therefore increasing their chances of sustainability in a private sector market; and are improving the health of herds (camels, goats, cattle) through services and simple surgery (e.g. dehorning). Enhancing the entrepreneurial skill of CAHWs will further strengthen their service delivery capabilities and the sustainability of their operations for the betterment of their communities.",positive
over half of FAO respondents commented that they no longer work in silos and now they know what the other sectors are doing.,positive
"he idea of the JRS itself was highly relevant and timely, both because of the need for a strengthened response, but also because of trends towards consortia in the development and aid fields.",positive
"Most notably, the JRS has improved each agency’s capacity and scope on community engagement and impact evaluation. In some instances, the JRS has allowed for implementation staff in the field to broaden their scope, in terms of community engagement as well as adding value through synchronization of activities. Because food security initiatives are intrinsically linked to agriculture, they must be synchronized both with the seasonal calendar and with",positive
"Farmer Field Schools, Water Committees and Fishing Cooperatives are examples of community groups with which FAO is working directly and building capacity not only for the sake of improved relationships with FAO, but also for the sake of the community group itself to better perform for its constituents or members. Another example is the work of the FAO livestock sector with CAHWs in the South Central region.",positive
"FFS use a cascading model whereby a master trainer (lead farmer) is trained (often along with Ministry of Agriculture extension workers, where appropriate) and those master trainers, usually a farmer from a particular district, then train other farmers in the community. In general, sustainability is ensured through strong farmer association building. The empowerment process, rather than the adoption of specific techniques, is what produces sustainability.",positive
". This being said, the RIMA surveys and the community consultations have since then devoted some attention to the specific vulnerabilities of interviewed households, and each sectoral team undertakes baseline assessments to better understand the needs of the communities they serve and areas for potential interventions, so the issue is progressively being corrected.",positive
"Notwithstanding the enormous challenges, a positive momentum for advancing a state-building process has been created for the first time in decades. This is an important opportunity for FAO and other UN agencies to step up their efforts in support of state structures, institutions and policies at all levels.",positive
"Government interest in this sector also offers the opportunity to align FAO’s efforts and priorities with those of the government, both in Puntland and in Dolow, and with nascent institutions.",positive
"FAO is well placed to contribute to building capacity on the ground, helping fishers add value to their production and, where feasible and with a livelihoods diversification approach in mind, supporting the capacity of people to join this sector.",positive

"overnance, pollution and fisheries indicators were tested using different approaches in the BOBLME regional context. This included collaboration with the GEF Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme (TWAP) initiative on LME indicators. Further work was organized at national level: several countries formed working groups and held review workshops on ecosystem health and pollution threats, criteria and remedial strategies; reviewed available data; and formed plans. The project subsequently supported a number of local actions.",positive
"A review of coastal pollution issues was undertaken in each of the eight countries, producing a useful set of country reports (2011). In 2012 the project convened the regional SAP planning workshop for the theme Pollution and Water Quality, which identified actions to address seven proposed categories of pollutants. In 2013 the project partnered with the South Asian Cooperative Environment Programme (SACEP) and UNEP Global Programme of Action (GPA) to produce a scoping study built on the country reports. In 2014 a modelling study was undertaken by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme under the UNEP TWAP project. A number of individual country studies were also supported. Some progress towards a regional strategy and action plan on pollution is apparent in the lengthy list of actions under the Pollution Theme of the SAP documen",positive
"The project made a significant effort to improve the quality of ecosystem modelling through collaboration with University of British Columbia, involving training and preparation of an exploratory ecosystem model of the BOBLME.",positive
The project developed links with both the global Large Marine Ecosystems (LME) Consultative Committee and the GEF-supported International Waters Program.,positive
A Regional working group was established and met once in 2010 to review ecosystem health practices.,positive
It is widely known that an ecosystem is a community of organisms that interact one another and with the environment to which they belong.,positive

"As general evaluation of the BIG Project implementation, the evaluation team considers that activities have been developed with technical and administrative efficiency by the responsible team, at the executing institution level, INEA and the PMU team, and at the implementing institution, the FAO/Brazil and FAO/Rome.",positive
"CIP processes were useful in setting country-level priorities for all stakeholders and responding to nationally recognized needs and gaps. However, they were not always sufficiently thorough or participatory to be completely owned by the countries, and gaps between CIP design and implementation reduced their relevance.",positive
"In most countries, REACH contributed to advancing national or subnational plans by drafting or contributing to processes that ensured their approval. In Ghana and Mozambique, engagement through REACH inspired a new intensity of nutrition planning at subnational levels.",positive
"The country case studies revealed significant underspending in all countries, partly because other donors or agencies funded activities that REACH had planned, as in Ghana, Mozambique, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.",positive
the secretariat has gradually introduced standardized programmes of work across REACH countries.,positive
"The initiative has contributed to greater stakeholder engagement, progress in national commitment to nutrition, more effective setting of priorities and capacity development.",positive

The evaluation found that all EMPRES components had relevant partnerships for building resilience to food chain crises.,positive
"AFIS has managed to support relevant state and national government institutions in the identification and use of several standardised methodologies. The project has effectively improved validation mechanism to ensure consensus on all food security reports for policy. AFIS has been effective in the coordination of information systems, taking the lead and contributing as a key partner to the systematic collection, analysis and dissemination of food security information. All such datasets are in the process of being completed with the aim of making them publically available for the use by government and other humanitarian and development actors. Nevertheless AFIS contribution to reduce gaps in the dataset is appreciated. While AFIS contribution is evident in crop production, market and rainfall data",positive
The appointment of the Secretary General of the Food Security Council (FSC) has been the major exception to the increasing fragile institutional environment in which AFIS operates.,positive
"In the short term, the FSL Cluster is the most active platform for decision making. AFIS support to both the FSC and the FSL Cluster is critical and needs to be further strengthened.",positive
Its communication for policy capacity has played a critical role in the project achievements – although not foreseen in the original formulation. This is even more appreciated when comparing the budget of all interventions which are planned and monitored on the basis of AFIS- supported data such as the IPC.,positive
"AFIS has managed to establish a good degree of collaboration with other technical organizations and should stay actively engaged in the FSIN Operational Strategy implementation – through FAO South Sudan and technical HQ team, if AFIS should not continue with the same characteristics.",positive
The integration of a nutrition component into AFIS design has contributed to connect nutrition and food security stakeholders.,positive
"Despite the unfavourable context, AFIS has been able to critically assist in the generation of primary data and to raise its support to its partners’ operations considered necessary for the functioning of the FSIS.",positive

"n a number of projects, FAO conducted technical workshops and on-the-job trainings for Lao specialists on the principles of drafting phytosanitary legislation that complies with international standards.",positive
AO was seen by the Government as having a role to play in this area.,positive
"FAO has contributed to better food security and nutrition data, though it also missed opportunities due to a lack of technical support. Its support to the National Agricultural Census process, as well as other analytical work, was widely acknowledged as useful and relevant, and was a good example of FAO building on its own strengths. The work in supporting monitoring and evaluation (M&E) was equally relevant and in line with the country’s needs",positive
"FAO’s role in policy development in these areas was generally acknowledged, and FAO was therefore expected to be a leader in driving and assisting the establishment of policies.",positive
"Nevertheless, the majority of the regional projects proved to be beneficial overall.",positive
"guably, however, the first policy documents provided the foundation for those that followed, and FAO is presently leading the revision of the blue book. The white paper on food security will be a relevant and useful document. Positive contributions have been made through the Nutrition Strategy and Plan of Action 2010-2015 and the Risk and Vulnerability Survey 2013",positive
"Nonetheless, there were some strong practices to build on for future activities and interactions with development partners. These partners have confirmed that FAO was viewed as an institution with considerable comparative advantages as a provider of capacity development support.",positive

"y effectively exploiting its comparative advantage in technical advice on social security financing, governance, and management of schemes, analysis of labour market and employment policies, international standards, and social dialogue, the ILO has added value. It has addressed, and continues to address, the purported trade-off between social protection and employment growth and has benefited from its pluralistic, pragmatic approach. Perhaps the ILO’s greatest achievement has been in ensuring that universalism figures prominently in the social protection toolkit. With UN endorsement of the Social Protection Floor (SPF) initiative, interest in this area has ignited",positive

Finally, the ILO has demonstrated innovativeness in adapting its approaches as a result of the international financial and employment crises that are currently affecting nearly all member States.",positive
"The Office has selected countries willing to develop NEPs and geared interventions to their situations. The evaluation credits the ILO with advancing global awareness of the issues and appreciation of the types of policy interventions with the potential to tackle countries’ employment problems. Countries’ demands have been met satisfactorily, as have policy- makers’ requests for tools and guidelines",positive
The ILO’s NEP support has so far been highly relevant in implementing the Social Justice Declaration and International Labour Conference mandates of 2010.3,positive
Social partners have strengthened their positions during policy deliberations beyond traditional tripartite agendas. Important achievements have been made regarding capacity building.,positive
"An evolving strategy to support the NEP process can be seen in past efforts, and there is already some understanding and discussion in the Office regarding future directions for such support. In general, elements and actions from different ILO units are complementary",positive
Convention No. 122 is well connected to NEP support and is helpful in pushing forward the NEP debates,positive

Internal and external coordination and communication were found to be adequate.,positive
The programme represents an effort to rethink and possibly realign the ILO’s and the international community’s stance vis à vis decent work. The programme has sought to re-examine ILO’s relationship to personal security in the light of the changing environment in which the organization operates.4 The ILO and the SES programme are to be congratulated for having addressed this set of issues.,positive
"An important question has been raised and an interesting conceptual approach to its solution has been put forward. A dedicated and very hardworking team has been formed, data has been collected, using innovative ways, and analysed. That analysis has been shared with interested researchers in a number of countries and sometimes prepared with them. It has also been shared with some policy makers. Interesting policy prescriptions have emerged, which have aroused a response and prompted vigorous debate in some of the countries concerned and in some instances policies appear to have been influenced by the analysis emanating from the SES programme.",positive

They appear to be used as a mechanism for resource mobilization when resources are scarce. Multi-country projects are being used for the efficiencies they offer.,positive
Projects linked to non-FPRW outcomes are supporting constituents' efforts to realize FPRW.,positive
Observed activities in non-FPRW strategies and actions do have positive effects on FPRW areas.,positive
"Since the realization of FPRW is closely connected to the supervision of the application of the fundamental conventions, the Director-General's decision to create the FPRW branch with coordination responsibility for FPRW outcomes is fitting, provided that close substantive collaboration continues with other units.",positive
The Office has also drawn up legislative profiles for 55 countries based on the main principles contained in C97 and C143 to help identify main obstacles to their ratification and implementation.,positive
"The level of extra-budgetary resources mobilized by MIGRANT alone increased by more than twelve-fold between 2004 and 2008. These technical cooperation projects have involved all sectors in the Office in their implementation. Social partners were active participants in the projects, in which social dialogue was a means of action and an objective. Other units in the Office have also raised resources for the implementation of projects. Together with the ILO’s International Training Centre in Turin, MIGRANT has designed and delivered three annual sessions of a capacity-building course for constituents.",positive

"acceptance and uptake of the framework is generally strong, especially within the ILO7 and at UN level, but also beyond, through integration in the SDGs, the G20 agenda and in some of the work of the international financial institutions. Within the ILO’s strategic frameworks, social protection was one of the main pillars for the 2012–17 period and is also reflected in the Programme and Budget for 2018–19. The narrative covers both country and global work",positive
"The visibility at country level increased clearly in countries with an ILO social protection field staff presence. Inter-agency col- laboration through SPIAC-B has been especially effective in facilitating dialogue and exchange with a widening group of agencies, and the World Bank in particular, to arrive at joint strategies in relation to the SDGs, discussing the harmonization of data sets and indicators and building a joint Inter-agency Social Protection Assessment (ISPA) toolbox",positive
"Specific examples were documented where ILO interventions contributed to a long-term sustainable change either at country or global levels. New ratifications of Convention No. 102, as a consequence of Recommendation No. 202 and the integration of social protection floors in the SDGs, are examples of the latter.",positive

"The move towards more analytical assessments of the enabling environment is a substantive way of linking enterprise development to a broader discussion of decent work and employment at the national policy level, provided that these assessments cover the decent work challenges linked to enterprises.",positive
Evidence suggests that this transition is under way.,positive
Particularly impressive is the work done to address women entrepreneurship.,positive
"The sustainable enterprise knowledge base, including recent studies, guides and other products, is impressive.",positive
"It is, therefore, critical for the ILO’s core standard-setting mandate. The evaluation found that national stakeholders value highly the substantive role of ILO.",positive
"They are developed in consultation with tripartite partners, particularly with governments, and are usually aligned with national development strategies, policies and planning instruments. As employment is fun- damental to poverty reduction and development in most countries receiving TC, aspects of the DWCP outcomes were also regularly found to appear in key UN system-wide documents. Recognition of the mandate and value of ILO is consistently high among its constituents and ministries of labour (MoLs),",positive
Decent Work Country Programmes (DWCPs) are the main instrument for the implementation of TC.,positive
"Among constituents, there is widespread satisfaction with the effectiveness of ILO TC activities.",positive
"The ILO has demonstrated comparative advantage in building links between macroeconomic and employment policies, which are combined with an array of analytical and operational tools geared to improve employability and employment of youth, thereby delivering an integrated approach. Tripartism, knowledge management, critical mass of experience, and an extended network of experts and implementation partners, are the main channels for realizing the ILO added value on youth employment, which ensures voice and participation for the most relevant actors.",positive
"Nonetheless, youth employment initiatives in case countries were found to bring together interventions from multiple departments, primarily those within the Employment Sector, but also from others to support components on migration, child labour and social dialogue, among others.",positive
"evertheless, innovative monitoring and evaluation methods are being applied on a project-by-project basis. Building the capacity of labour market institutions to support the monitoring and evaluation of youth employment strategies and plans will be a key factor in the success of this effort.",positive
"The ILO has worked closely through the YEN to make youth employment a matter of priority and has taken the lead in supporting the drawing up of most of the national action plans (NAPs) on youth employment in the 31 countries (mid-2009), which are at some stage of NAP development or implementation.",positive
"ILO global and country interventions on youth employment have been coherent both with the GEA and ILC youth employment documents, and with regard to UN approaches for youth employment.",positive
"As regards the attention and approaches aimed at addressing youth employment, the evaluation found coherence at regional levels and good alignment with the current youth employment approach being pursued by the Office.",positive
The national action plans launched since 2008 offer potential for addressing these shortcomings.,positive
ILO action has contributed to improving national capacity for problem analysis and policy-making as has emerged clearly in the preparation of national action plans and in the formulation of other policies related to youth employment in countries where the ILO has been active.,positive
"The ILO youth employment approach and initiatives are relevant to the employment-related needs of youth, national decent work agendas, and the priorities of the ILO constituents.",positive
The ILO is responding with knowledge and technical support that has demonstrated its usefulness in the development of country strategies to address youth employment challenges.,positive
"Thus more information will be forthcoming in the next biennium, with the improved emphasis on addressing gender equality in evaluations. The results of an independent evaluation on how gender equality is addressed across a range of ILO evaluations should be available in early 2016.",positive
survey conducted for this evaluation reported that ILO is doing well on addressing enabling institutional mechanisms for gender equality.,positive
"Clearly some strategies were effective, such as support to develop programmes that address the different impacts of HIV and AIDS on women and men; or the resource guide on gender issues in employment and labour market policies developed following a 24 country review analyzing national employment policies. Some country based examples include: in India, the state has now agreed to introduce a gender balance in social dialogue, (following support from and collaboration with gender and also social dialogue ILO specialists). Another positive example from the Philippines illustrates how the Domestic Labour Act was enforced.",positive
he launch of the forthcoming Women at Work centenary initiative is important as it will allow a focus on particular areas in which ILO should lead amongst other UN specialised agencies.,positive
"Some progress has been made within ILO. ILO, gender specialists and some ILO staff (working on other projects) were instrumental in gender related work undertaken in-country.",positive
The ILO Action Plan for Gender Equality 2010-15 is fully aligned with the ILO Strategic Policy Framework 2010-15 and continues to operationalize the ILO policy on gender equality and mainstreaming.,positive
"The Action Plan clearly calls for a gender responsive Evaluation Summary Evaluation Office International Labour Office ILO Evaluation Summaries - Page 1 delivery of the Decent Work Agenda. It cleverly links to 2009 International Labour Conference conclusions on gender equality; and to the P&B outcomes statements requiring accompanying text to include strategies on ‘gender equality and non- discrimination’. The Action Plan notes corresponding indicators in the UN System Wide Action Plan for gender equality and women’s empowerment (the UN-SWAP, see Box 2)",positive
"rom 2016 a strong gender equality clause will be included in all evaluation terms of reference. Thus more information will be forthcoming in the next biennium, with the improved emphasis on addressing gender equality in evaluations. The results of an independent evaluation on how gender equality is addressed across a range of ILO evaluations should be available in early 2016.",positive

Other UN agencies look to ILO for guidance around gender and work related areas.,positive
"In the first group, ILO’s interventions appear to be implemented as well as those in countries not affected by crisis. In the second group, interventions are implemented as well as in countries not affected by crisis.",positive
"t can also contribute to the xi Executive summary drafting of a rebuilding strategy in coordination with other UN agencies on topics related to employment and decent work, in line with its mandate. At a later stage, and with a longer term perspective, the ILO can support the transition to the recovery and development phase, focusing in particular on capacity-building interventions at all levels.",positive
"The findings also underlined the importance of the key dimensions of project implementation including the development of synergies, ensuring sustainability and a focus on gender mainstreaming.",positive
"In order to support the effective implementation of the key ILO Conventions and Recommendations into policies and practices in its member States, the ILO carries out an exceptionally wide range of interventions in the field of labour protection, unparalleled by any other international organization.",positive
"support for the ratification of ILO Conventions and development of national legislative texts or strategic action plans; the development and reinforcement of social dialogue; awareness-raising on key issues for a range of key stakeholders; the development of tools such as training materials, data collection mechanisms and guidebooks; and the introduction of OSH protection mechanisms in enterprises.",positive
"Nevertheless, some CPRs, such as those for Cambodia, demonstrated a healthy balance between practicality and professional rigour in their use and interpretation of the ratings.",positive
this in itself is a force for cohesion and has opened some doors for the ILO to advance other parts of the Decent Work Agenda.,positive
"Among the more significant were those of the ILO–MasterCard Foundation project and the pivotal role the ILO played in the Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth. At the regional level, key initiatives also aligned with the three pillars,",positive
"These findings were confirmed by this evaluation in the cases wherein projects and other technical support were designed in line with the “multi-pronged” approach, leading to observable and tangible results. In the survey, staff generally rated the organization highly in meeting its strategic objectives.",positive
"In contrast, the staff survey was quite positive overall.",positive
"In other countries, there is optimism about impact and sustainability, but only time will tell, e.g., Egypt’s endeavours to align efforts through the Youth Employment Programme, or services put in place through Sri Lanka’s Skills to Support Local Economic Development (SKILLED) project. In China, there is evidence of the impact and sustain- ability of past ILO actions (e.g., the institutionalization of Know About Business (KAB)) and, in Peru, an earlier joint UN project, which introduced a number of youth employment initiatives.",positive
"The ILO’s work remained responsive to new developments, including Transition from the Informal to the Formal Economy Recommendation, 2015 (No. 204), Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience Recommendation, 2017 (No. 205) and the SDGs. The ILO has played a convening role within the UN system and attempted more broadly to focus attention on the youth employment dimensions of these developments, notably through the Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth.",positive
"Its work in reaching out to those “not in employment education or training” (NEET) has potential application in other settings, and therefore positions the ILO to take a lead role in this area.",positive
"Looking ahead, the ILO as custodian of SDG indicators on youth employment is in a key position to pro- mote and monitor impact and sustainability over the SDG time frame. Its role in the Global Initiative can also support this, given its focus on maximizing impact.",positive
The ILO’s unique links to constituents and its deep understanding of the issues are assets that can be used to position the Organization as a global leader in the field.,positive
Institutional coherence is thus no longer a concern.,positive
"Good logical frameworks helped managers steer through the complexities of the operational environment. In turn, good management was able to overcome weaknesses in the design.",positive
"However, accountability frameworks, usually in the form of project steering committees, are becoming more commonplace.",positive
"Decentralized management structures tended to be more responsive to country needs, especially when supported by local management and clearly established support lines.",positive
The crop of interventions shows very few outliers with better than average performance or underperformers that are significantly weaker than similar interventions.,positive
The gender dimension is now generally acknowledged by technical cooperation.,positive
"In a few cases, resource endowments were quite comfortable.",positive
A review of publications that appeared between 2011 and 2013 further confirms this judgment.,positive
The ILO is the only international organization in the position to assist in the development of labour migration policies that adequately reflect the interests of all actors in the world of work.,positive
"External actors and constituents interviewed during the evaluation were generally aware of the Multilateral Framework and spoke positively about it, considering it to be a good reference guide.",positive
"The Office has responded to the findings of an earlier external evaluation (of 2008, see GB.303/PFA/3/5) in collaborating more with other organizations to advance the ILO’s mandate on labour migration and in stepping up action on positively linking migration and development, as evidenced by a growing technical cooperation portfolio and other means of action.",positive
"There were a number of factors internal to the ILO that shaped the outcomes of interventions, in particular, arrangements concerning the development of suitable design, objectives, implementation arrangements, and monitoring systems. In addition, evaluations stressed the need for full consultation within the Office, between relevant departments, and also with key stakeholders and donors, both at the design stage and throughout project implementation. It was observed that evaluations of global and/or multi-country projects focused on broad themes (e.g. social dialogue and industrial relations in general, child labour or gender mainstreaming) suggest that targeted interventions are more effective than those that are broad and general.",positive
"Hardly any similar types of interventions aiming to support social dialogue and tripartism exist apart from (limited) activities in the EU. This illustrates and confirms that social dialogue and tripartism remain central to the broader ILO agenda. The review of materials suggests that social dialogue, strong social partners’ involvement, and a culture of tripartism contribute significantly to improvements in socio-political and economic outcomes.",positive
"A number of evaluations on labour law reform and support for labour administration/inspectorate systems referred to the traditionally strong expertise that the ILO has had in these areas, as well as in comparative industrial relations.",positive
"he Decent Work dimension attracts sympathy from the wider development community, and ILO has, with the support of (especially) the Gates Foundation, managed to place itself at a central place in the microinsurance development context.",positive
"And the SFP has met the challenges with relevant responses, namely the MF4DW and the MIIF, and by corresponding to requests from within and outside the ILO. The country studies confirm that, overall, social finance has been taken in as a relevant tool in most of ILO’s TC field project",positive
"The contribution by ILO in setting up the Micro insurance Network and the A2II, as well as playing a central role in these fora, is an important SFP outcome.",positive
he many partnerships in which the SFP engages contribute to making ILO messages known and sustained in the wider context.,positive
"e choice of partners is important for sustainability; in this regard, SFP has been smart at the global policy level by placing the ILO together with some of the most important organisations within microfinance.",positive
The relevance of social finance at the strategic level has been fairly clear in the period under evaluation.,positive
"he SFP has promoted work on financial literacy for specific groups in a number of specific countries, but no major, structured programme has been developed as yet.",positive
"The MF4DW has put the DWA on the global microfinance map through an innovative, experimental approach.",positive
"Overall however, the relationship between the human and economic resources used and the results achieved is considered reasonable, and in some cases very good; the strategic direction of resource flows have corresponded with the needs, the ILO comparative advantage, and have contributed to fulfilling the SF mandate.",positive
The increasing incorporation of social finance in DWCPs is an indicator of sustainability through the ILO structure and on to the constituents and other partners.,positive
The focus on poverty alleviation embedded in project design and the relevance of ILO interventions to national decent work priorities were also considered to be successful.,positive
"Examples are the DWCP outcomes framework, the engagement with the tripartite constituents, and efforts made to institutionalize the Decent Work Agenda into the country institutions.",positive
"channel for increased development assistance funding. In addition, the ILO learned some valuable lessons from the Argentine experience for the future handling of financial crises.",positive
"evaluators found that the ILO country office in Jakarta was highly regarded for its achievements in the reconstruction effort, including successful management of a large, diverse technical cooperation portfolio.",positive
"Tanzania, Government leadership in overseeing aid management was evident in the creation of the Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania (JAST) and by efforts to strengthen Government core processes for planning, budgeting and monitoring.",positive
"owever, it did reaffirm that the strategy of pursuing a Decent Work Country Programme, as opposed to a set of individual projects, was sound.",positive
"he evaluations demonstrated that in some countries, such as Indonesia, much effort had been placed in capacity building and in the development of information management systems to assist the monitoring and evaluation of Decent Work initiatives by such agencies.",positive
"e ILO Country Office for Indonesia was also found to have raised the visibility of the concept of decent work, accelerated the ratification of core labour conventions, provided excellent training and training materials, and helped develop the capacity of various tripartite organizations.",positive

he use of four different methods to gather evidence to assess DWCP results: these were the perceptions of ILO management and staff; the perceptions of informed observers of the ILO Country Office in Indonesia’s efforts during the years under evaluation; the findings of mid-term and final evaluations of relevant Technical Cooperation Projects conducted by the ILO Country Office in Indonesia and progress made on the official indicators and targets established in the DWCP.,positive
ecent work. This emphasis on decent work created a comparative advantage for the Lab over other knowledge generation initiatives.,positive
he Lab also demonstrated success in producing technical knowledge and working with projects to develop rigorous monitoring and results measurement systems.,positive
It has also been successful in adding value and richness to the technical debates around job creation through market systems development approach.,positive
The Lab has been able to effectively embed itself within the wider donor community pursuing a decent work and employment creation agenda through a market systems development approach.,positive
"particularly the case for the BASIC project, as well as certain activities under the Global Product, which furthered work initiated in specific countries.",positive
"ught the ILO at the forefront of the United Nations organizations with regards to the advancement of Gender rights and non- discrimination in the world of work. Funding PRIDE has also given Norway a positive reputation as being the sole ILO donor focused on rights issues as they relate to these communities. Considering that the monetary outlay for PRIDE programming over the course of Norway’s PA was not overly cumbersome, funding future related initiatives provides both the ILO and donor with considerably more positive visibility, at limited cost, while ensuring that the rights of minority communities are respected.",positive
"This evaluation has found that the interventions supported by Norway and Sweden to promote gender mainstreaming, as well as the BASIC and PRIDE Projects, were strategically relevant to Outcome 17, and coherent with the wider ILO P&B strategy.",positive
"The flexible approach to gender mainstreaming, based on creating synergies and complementing work from other Outcomes (5, 9, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19) and the Area of Critical Importance (ACI 2) was found to lead to positive results, both in terms of achieving specific outputs in collaboration with constituents, and in sensitizing ILO officials to gender issues.",positive
"unding from Norway and Sweden led to changes in legislation, policies, and a shift in attitudes of workers, employers, governments and civil society regarding gender equality and discrimination in the workplace, leading to important impacts in the countries and regions involved.",positive
"bi national and tri national workshops took place in the 5 migration corridors and beyond, to develop strategies, build alliances and move forward the agenda for domestic workers. An inter-regional knowledge sharing workshop in Madagascar was reported as particularly effective with ILO playing an excellent facilitating role amongst constituents and others, and an emphasis on labour agreements between regions and countries. These events allowed for countries to learn from each other, and to understand the international context under which MDWs are placed",positive
For example a study contributed to discussions around lowering this age ban in Nepal.,positive
"When disseminated and widely referenced in other initiatives, these tools should continue to enhance awareness of social partners so they can advocate for MDWs.",positive
"he three vocational training skills manuals developed in Argentina to professionalize workers who care for the elderly, children and housework are already being further adapted for migrants in refugee situations, and will be piloted in 2017 in Jordan, Lebanon and in Egypt.",positive
"Nevertheless in Lebanon, innovative pilots were put in place with bank employees, which are expanding further through ILO projects currently under negotiation. In Malaysia, the employers’ organization and government launched a code of conduct for employers of domestic workers in March 2016. Research in South Africa and Malaysia also provided useful insights on how employers view MDWs. In Argentina, employers were encouraged to register their domestic worke",positive
"Managed from ILO Geneva, the project had global, national and migration corridor focused elements under a strong gender and workers rights focus.",positive
"The strong collaboration with and between ITUC and IDWF, and the technical assistance provided to IDWF to support their founding congress were effective for global strategies to improve the organization of MDWs. Many regiona",positive
"Another achievement was the quantitative statistical module included in the Zimbabwe Labour Force Survey, which provided a detailed profile of the flows of migrant workers.",positive
"In Paraguay the project contributed towards the passing of new law on domestic work approved by Parliament in March 2015, equating domestic workers rights with all wage workers rights. In Argentina, with new legislation passed in 2015, a relatively higher number of MDWs enrolled for social security",positive
"Many stakeholders interviewed were appreciative of the support from the EU, which allowed for a spotlight MDWs via ILO and partners.",positive
"In conclusion, the GAP-MDW project allowed for an exclusive opportunity to research and focus on the migrant domestic workers domain.",positive
"When disseminated widely, and packaged in discrete policy briefs, the Global Report on Migrant Domestic Workers will be significant for driving policy advice and change, as it draws on many experiences across the globe.",positive
"The SWTS methodology was recognized by a consensus of stakeholders as potentially more relevant for policy dialogue and policy development than information currently available from labour force surveys and responds to the need for youth-specific information regarding employment trends, wages, policies and practices highlighted in “The youth employment crisis: A call for action.”",positive
"In addition, several W4Y supported studies have analysed factors that impact transition. Information generated through W4Y has been incorporated into the knowledge base that informs the ongoing work of the ILO and The MasterCard Foundation in employment policy, youth employment, programme development and advocacy.",positive
"Both ILO staff within the W4Y project team and ILO officials and experts who had links with the project through their work in youth employment cited the “hands-on” involvement of the MCF and the close working relationship between the project team at the ILO and MCF as being key to meeting the ambitious project targets for SWTS delivery. As of 30 March 2016, most planned deliverables had been completed or exceeded, with pending products in a late stage of development.",positive
"This information has been widely disseminated in the form of reports and has been incorporated into global databases maintained by the ILO (YouthStats). SWTS information is a resource within the ILO for their ongoing global work in employment policy and in youth employment and for the MasterCard Foundation for their program and advocacy work for youth. The project has curated microdata on youth transition from all the participating countries and made this available to researchers, analysts and other youth employment stakeholders.",positive
The knowledge products have been disseminated widely at the global level and have informed major publications on youth employment.,positive
At the global/regional level proxy indicators for use of the SWTS in new or ongoing dialogue are available.,positive
"Many of the search results are either W4Y publications or republications in other sources of thematic reports, technical notes or conference presentations for W4Y events.",positive
The project has added significantly to the global body of detailed information about youth employment by implementing the SWTS survey in 34 countries.,positive
"The ILO added value to addressing HIV by working in its areas of comparative advantage using tripartite dialogue and building on experience across different ILO sectors. Over time, policy dialogue on HIV in the world of work has increasingly been well informed by the constituents, national AIDS bodies and UN partners.",positive
"The Code of Practice on HIV and the World of Work has been very instrumental in raising awareness and as a concrete tool to inform governments, employers and workers on the key issues. Many global evaluation interviewees consider the Code of Practice to be the cornerstone of the ILO programme. The Code of Practice is now supplemented and strengthened by the adoption of Recommendation 200, which tripartite",positive
"constituents and civil society view as a vital standards instrument, particularly in high HIV priority countries.",positive
"Decent Work Country Programmes (DWCPs) reflect the priority given to HIV and AIDS and the world of work for most countries of the Southern African region. In Asia, a fair number of DWCP have recognized HIV at the output level, and usually linked to a broader social protection outcome",positive
"At country level, the technical input of the ILO on a range of issues, including specifically on HIV in the world of work, is appreciated although some note that it is important for the ILO to provide more financial input to support their statements on the importance of HIV in the world of work.",positive
The ILO programme on HIV in the world of work has achieved a very good range of successes built on a foundation that is well based in the ILO mandate on labour rights and working conditions.,positive
The ILO made significant progress on the development of HIV and AIDS national and workplace tripartite policies as part of the national AIDS response in different countries.,positive
"The ILO has been very good at using research, knowledge generation, and capacity strengthening which have also been designed and implemented in a way that addresses capacity gaps, including capacity of constituent organisations.",positive
"t country level, the ILO is a well-accepted member of the Joint UN team and in other UN coordination bodies.",positive
"The HIV and AIDS technical cooperation initiatives demonstrated solid financial delivery performance, reaching an estimated 84.3 per cent financial delivery in 2009 and 90.7 per cent in 2010, and a similar reported progress in technical delivery, according to ILO‘s financial reports.",positive
"The ILO‘s results-based framework, design and implementation systems have mostly increased the coherence and effectiveness of its support to member States including evidence of rational prioritization of countries.",positive
The ILO contributes to global policy dialogue and works to ensure that the ILO strategies and priority areas on HIV in the world of work are considered in the global programme.,positive
"ood design decisions included: building on the achievements of previous partnership phases; choosing countries with a strong ILO presence and with staff resources to adequately assess and follow- up on project supported interventions, working in countries which presented opportunities to build on other relevant, ongoing or recently concluded ILO programs, and focusing on sectors considered economically important to target countries but which are characterized by important decent work deficits.",positive
Some relevant communication tools and activities at the country level were carried out however.,positive
"The project contributed to practical measures to improve respect for freedom of association and collective bargaining rights in a number of countries. Examples include developing guidelines and raising the awareness of judges and prosecutors involved in labour rights cases (Sri Lanka and the Philippines), supporting the creation of tripartite social dialogue forums (Malawi, Morocco, Zambia), and the development and support for implementation of national or sectoral action plans on freedom of association and collective bargaining (Malawi, Brazil, Rwanda, Zambia).",positive
"In most countries and in global training activities, the project sought to achieve gender balance among participants and records of participation were sex-disaggregated. Some countries were purposeful in mainstreaming gender into program activities by focusing on discrimination and sexual harassment.",positive
"Reporting was adequate and balanced the need for formal reporting with managers’ time constraints and their need to focus on implementation. Geneva and managers implementing country level activities reported having regular consultations to adjust plans to account for challenges and opportunities in the field. Final country progress reports for China, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Zambia were detailed and thoughtful in their analysis.",positive
The global component of the project produced a number of ILO Evaluation Summaries - Page 4 potentially useful information and capacity building tools and training activities.,positive
"Notable project achievements were the creation/reconstitution of tripartite social dialogue bodies in Malawi and Zambia. Vietnam is a noteworthy example of a country where the project was able to complement the work of an existing ILO program and capitalize on an unexpected political/trade related opening which may lead to the ratification of C. 87 and 98 in the next five years. Programs in Jordan, Morocco, and Zambia were exemplary for their efforts to work with relevant national stakeholders on promoting collective bargaining in particularly strategic sectors of their target countries’ national economies. Most countries integrated gender considerations in meaningful ways – but in particular the program in Sri Lanka. The Philippines was exceptionally creative in reaching a wide variety of stakeholders.",positive
The country level component featured a variety of effective interventions in 13 countries which were generally in line with the project intervention strategy presented in the PRODOC.,positive
Gender was mainstreamed into project strategies and activities effectively in many countries and in some of the global component products.,positive
The project effectively leveraged human and financial resources from other ongoing ILO programs in about half of it target countries.,positive
"At both the global and country levels, project managers implemented strategies to favor the sustainability of project actions.",positive
"n the remaining countries, the project was relevant in ILO Evaluation Summaries - Page 3 promoting better and enhanced compliance with Convention 81. The project responds to the priorities identified by the donor, Norway, for the P&B 2014-2015 for Outcome 11, as reflected in the Outcome Based Partnership Agreements. Besides, there is complementarity between the project and other ILO projects and programmes.",positive
"It includes an adequate analysis of the problem where it is highlighted that even when ILO member States have adequate labour laws in place, they may still lack the capacity to ensure compliance with these laws.",positive
"Consultations took place with the ILO country offices and field specialits in most of the cases, with few exceptions. The project design looked sensitive enough to stakeholder capacity and commitment in all countries.",positive
"With cost-sharing, the most was made of global products. The project was efficient in its technical aspects, often using existing ILO products.",positive
"Of the three project outcomes, the greatest expectation of sustainability can be found in outcome 1, institutional capacity development, since in many cases results are anchored to national institutions and can be sustained by national partners at the end of the project.",positive
"In China, Bosnia Herzegovina and the Philippines the project has contributed to strengthen collective action as a complementary means towards achieving workplace compliance through the cooperation between the various actors in the area of workplace compliance, mainly with awareness raising activities among the social partners and other actors involved in specific sectors like the informal economy.",positive
"In terms of strengthening workplace compliance, the Academy has helped achieve outcome 2 by improving the capacities of inspectors and social partners who attend the same.",positive
"China, who received the third higher allocation in the project shows a potential significant impact also due to its dedication to ratifying Convention 81.",positive
The level of expertise of resource persons is highly satisfactory.,positive
"Global knowledge is transferable to all countries if publications, such as desk reviews and methodological studies, are systematically shared with recommendations to countries on how to use them.",positive
tudies and capacity building workshops are conducted by highly qualified ILO Evaluation Summaries - Page 4 experts. The training provided allowed participants to achieve a basic theoretical knowledge,positive
"All national stakeholders interviewed confirmed that the project met their needs. Generally, the project targeted relevant countries, industries and sectors for which national strategies exist.",positive
The integrative approach of providing a set of tools and methodologies is perceived positively by project stakeholders.,positive
The satisfaction rate regarding training and capacity building provided by the project is high.,positive
"The STRENGTHEN project’s interventions are integrated in supporting the implementation of the new National Employment Policy in Ghana, National Decent Work Policy in Guatemala and the Philippine Labour and Employment Plan.",positive
"The project did an excellent work in establishing appropriate conditions for sustainable project effectiveness through a consultative approach, working in close cooperation with key ministries and social partners.",positive
The project experienced significant delays in partner countries at various degrees.,positive
ILO project teams receive adequate administrative support.,positive
"It has conducted research, reviews of laws on child labour and/or forced labour, dissemination and bringing stakeholders together to develop road maps or NAPs, for CL, CDW, and Forced Labour (FL). In over 15 countries, GAP11 has contributed to the mainstreaming of NAPs in national development plans, mainstreaming of CDW in NAP-CL and subsequently in the national development plans, as well as mainstreaming of forced labour into national protective policy frameworks.",positive
"Focus on CDW has resulted in improved protection for child domestic workers. Also of importance is the practical guide and toolkit, which is a resource created for global use. The work on CDW was very well coordinated with Component 1, with the legal reviews and policy changes being done together in countries where both components existed.",positive
"GAP11’s work on forced labour contributed to knowledge development on laws and enforcement mechanisms, i.e. to Expected Outcome 1. Further work was taken up in eight countries: Paraguay, Cameroon, Ecuador, Mongolia, Namibia, Timor-Leste and Indonesia. Significant outcomes were achieved, at the policy level in Paraguay, and at policy and enforcement mechanisms in Ecuador.",positive
"ountries such as Ecuador and Philippines have also been able to allocate budgets for elimination of child labour and forced labour, showing that ownership and commitment of local stakeholders enhances sustainability of the outcomes.",positive
"Capitalising on ongoing research for social protection and education, e.g. conditional cash transfers, impacted child labour",positive
"It was found that the presence of all three components increases efficiency, in terms of staff usage, and combining of activities across components.",positive
"The project team collaborated well the ILOs country offices, and leveraged funds from other ILO projects, and was able to cover 46 countries instead of the 42 indicated in the initial project document.",positive
GAP11 has had several positive outcomes.,positive
"It has been possible to strengthen research and monitoring mechanisms at the national level, and strengthen the implementation, monitoring, vigilance and support systems at the local levels.",positive
"Towards achieving Expected Outcome 2, GAP11 contributed to strengthened research capacities in government and research institutions.",positive
"GAP11 addressed the issue of forced labour in all 22 countries covered for Component 1, by ensuring that the legal reviews covered both child labour and forced labour.",positive
"With knowledge creation, data collection, improvement of data collection systems, capacity building of a wide range of national stakeholders, and efforts towards ratifications of Convention 189 and the Forced Labour protocol, GAP11 has laid good ground work towards Alliance 8.7, contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) target 8.7.",positive
"Among the case study countries, Philippines has made a commitment to remove 1 million children from labour by 2025 under the SDG goals.",positive
Ecuador has been collaborating regionally to join the Alliance 8.7 and make firm commitments by end of 2017,positive
"Where changes have been made, this has generally been a strategic response to changes in the project context and resources have been reallocated accordingly. In addition the project has done a good job of using SIDA resources to lever core staff work funded by RB, and to link to other matching sources of funding.",positive
"These impacts appear to have been effective in contributing to the objectives of Outcome 5 of the ILO strategy in a number of ways, and the project experience has generated a number of lessons.",positive
"Firstly, key approach of the project has been to link policy development with attitude change, which has been of particular significance in the context of high levels of informality.",positive
"Another crucial approach of the project has been to very effectively use research, tools and knowledge to bring a ‘technical’ element to essentially political debates, which has created a legitimacy for ILO inputs and a common ground on which otherwise opposed tripartite organizations are able to discuss and negotiate.",positive
The Programme’s focus on youth employment is based on shared objectives and principles between Sweden and the ILO. The evaluation also found that the Sida/ILO Partnership responds to the “call for action” and is well aligned with the Area of Critical Importance 2: “Jobs and skills for youth”,positive
"On the other hand, the Sida/ILO Partnership supports and complements prior/on-going ILO youth employment initiatives in the targeted countries.",positive
This was possible thanks to a very good articulation between ILO efforts and national priorities in the countries and the high quality of ILO staff and its coordination with national partners.,positive
Informal apprenticeship frameworks and skills training and certification schemes can contribute to facilitate the youth to access the labour market. The support provided to public employment services has the potential to help job searchers and employers in enabling linkages between supply and demand.,positive
"Notwithstanding, the project delivered the expected products on time.",positive
"Decent work and youth employment have gained in importance in national development agendas in countries like Sudan, Morocco, Zambia, Uruguay, Ecuador or Samoa. National Employment Strategies (NES) and Youth Employment Plans (YEP) have the potential to promote job creation in the medium to long term.",positive
The project has also established complementarity and synergies with other ILO projects and initiatives that could help contribute to sustainability.,positive
"On the whole, ILO has used these avenues well to promote the DWA. ILO activities in the countries aimed at mainstreaming DW are in line with the priorities identified at regional and national levels",positive
"Locally, it is complementary to other UN initiatives but complementarity with other international organizations’ strategies is not so strong, although there were examples of fruitful cooperation, e.g. IMF and EC locally.",positive
"With regards to mainstreaming of DW in sectoral policies, several areas stood out.",positive
The ILO has been mostly effective in highlighting DW concerns of women workers in policies and programmes.,positive
"At the national level, the inclusion of DW elements in the national UNDAF has progressed.",positive
"This can be explained by the fact that the Office has been successful in embedding the centrality of DW in several global and international platforms with high likelihood of continued support from these agencies. Similarly, a number of upstream activities, covering national laws and policies related to DW mainstreaming were noted.",positive
The outcome strategy is strongly complementary to other initiatives globally.,positive
The ILO has been successful in working with national constituents to achieve the mainstreaming of DW concepts in national development plans and relevant polices.,positive
There is clear evidence of greater reflection of DW concerns in UNDAFs and joint UN programmes; the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) toolkit was useful in mainstreaming DW into national policies and UNDAFs in the countries where it was piloted.,positive
South-South Triangulation Cooperation has proved to be an important avenue in promoting DW mainstreaming both via special programmes and under the umbrellas of formal regional alliances.,positive
"ILO vertical management arrangements have mostly worked well in terms of supporting greater mainstreaming of DW, but certain challenges persist, e.g. related to vertical coherence and the availability of experts regionally and locally to provide technical support in high-level collaborations as well as timely response to national constituents’ technical assistance (TA) requests.",positive
There are indications that financial resources are being efficiently used and some key global initiatives are leveraging resources.,positive
The overall scoring11 finds the performance somewhat satisfactory with a comparatively higher score on impact and sustainability.,positive
EIIS is an area with a high political profile for its techniques and services. In a small number of countries it has made significant inroads into mainstreaming the techniques across the range of investment decisions. Results have been quite encouraging where governments have taken conscious decisions to promote EIIS as another strategy against poverty and unemployment.,positive
"The evaluation finds EIIS employs an impressive range of effective techniques and experience, and generating many country level successes, primarily as pilots over the last 25 years.",positive
"Of the 40 initiatives in the Implementation Plan, the evaluation found that 78 per cent were either complete or in progress.",positive
Participation of ILO field offices in the UNCTs has also improved as reflected in references to the ILO in the UNDAFs.,positive
"There was widespread agreement among tripartite constituents that the ILO’s mandate and work are hi- ghly relevant, useful and increasingly important but that the current FOS is not always fully aligned with current and future needs.",positive
"The guidance and knowledge tools are generally well received, although considered somewhat heavy.",positive
"The creation of the global technical teams (GTTs) is mostly seen as a positive development, having the potential to dismantle the walls of well-entrenched silos within the ILO by encouraging cross-engagement from HQ to the regions, as well as between regions, but the level of functioning varies.",positive
The staff and constituents praised the training offered through the ITC–ILO with the latter requesting continued efforts towards a more decentralized training approach.,positive
"The reform and improvement of the FOS are beginning to show results, although progress varies by region and type of outcome.",positive
"At the operational level, most IOM staff at the COs and ROs that have reportedly applied the MCOF, along with the IOM staff at the HQ level, viewed the MCOF as being a useful reference tool in preparedness, response, transition and recovery, and migration management initiatives in their respective contexts by increasing IOM’s credibility. Other reported outcomes and impacts of the MCOF at the global, regional, and country levels include increased stakeholder: a) awareness about and the knowledge and capacity to prepare, respond to, and transition and recover from a crisis situation; and b) interest in obtaining IOM support for preparing, responding to, and transitioning and recovering from crisis situations.",positive
"No major problems were detected and the evaluation makes positive conclusions on the overall management of the 1035 Facility, including the information shared with IOM Member States.",positive
"was also noted that some projects had a clear and visible impact, for instance resulting in changes to legislation, the setting-up of new departments responsible for migration, or the approval of policy declarations for inter- State cooperation. It can be concluded that the majority of projects achieved their expected",positive
"Thirteen Member States answered the related questions, and there was a clear consensus that capacity-building projects should remain a central focus for 1035 Facility funding.",positive
"In the questionnaire replies, Member States did not raise any issues concerning IOM’s overall management of the expanded Facility.",positive
"With regard to outcome and impact analysis, most of the projects assessed attained their expected outcome, in line with initial objectives.",positive
and that the actions taken by IOM offices and governments may be considered satisfactory in terms of sustainability.,positive
Use of sites such as the M4D and consistent use of IOM press releases have been beneficial.,positive
"The project through its research, dialogue components and pilot interventions in financial literacy provides relevant services to migrants and diaspora(s) as well as national policy makers in South Asia.",positive
The project was implemented in a relatively efficient manner.,positive
"Project activities have largely been implemented on time, with sufficient technical and financial support.",positive
This project offers an excellent example of IOM’s technical and operational capacity with a strong presence in SEA and the EU.,positive
All IOM missions have sufficient country programmes and have maximised synergies between activities undertake in this project with other migration and development and labour migration programming.,positive
"It is encouraging to see that so much of the funding actually reaches the national levels in SEA, especially given the scope of activities. As a principal, funds should follow the decentralized mode of implementation, and this project is a good example.",positive
"The national dialogue mechanisms have had some reach among the potential audience of policy makers and practitioners, and have benefited from more specific dialogue such as the Thursday forums in Manila.",positive
"The research conducted has been relatively effective in mapping the remittance corridors between the Philippines and Italy; Indonesia and the Netherlands, Indonesia and Malaysia and Philippines and Malaysia, and collecting data on SEA and Europe corridors.",positive
The project has partially been able to produce solid publications for dissemination based on the research findings.,positive
Governments are pleased with the provision of data regarding remittance corridors to S. E Asia and Europe.,positive
"The diaspora platform in the Netherlands is one of the projects key achievements, having brought together various diaspora entities in the Netherlands that had previously never interacted and represented various interest, age groups and affiliations of Indonesian diaspora members in the Netherlands.",positive
"Other reported outcomes and impacts of the MCOF at the global, regional, and country levels include increased stakeholder: a) awareness about and the knowledge and capacity to prepare, respond to, and transition and recover from a crisis situation; and b) interest in obtaining IOM support for preparing, responding to, and transitioning and recovering from crisis situations.",positive
"he research is of good quality and useful not only to IOM, but also to partners in Italy.",positive
"Several promotional activities were also implemented during the preparatory phase, with good overall performance.",positive
"Concerning the first area, IOM’s expertise, including with MIDA, is noted and the evaluation concludes that the projects and programmes can be effective tools for development under precise conditions, in particular the proper identification of needs.",positive
he report recommends continuation of the researches that IOM conducts for mapping the diasporas and their potential as investment partners.,positive
"During the evaluation interviews but also a survey conducted among IMs, a high awareness of Australian Government policies and the dangers surrounding irregular sea pathways was noted by over 90% of the interviewed IMs.",positive
"i) the focus of the awareness-raising campaigns on the residents of coastal communities was key to fighting irregular migration; (ii) piloting the method of engaging multilingual officers with necessary experience, language and interpersonal skills to counsel migrants and deliver migration-related messaging increased the legal processing of refugee and asylum claims in Indonesia; (iii) the combination of engagement with local key opinion formers, awareness-raising events and workshops produced a significant hardening in attitudes against people smuggling ventures and a behavioral change; and, finally, (iv) the community key opinion formers showed greater commitment to enhance cooperation in preventing people smuggling and doubled the rate of interceptions of IMs since 2010.",positive
"The MOMI project fully reached the projected result as it conveyed messages via 21 surveys to over 7,000 IMs (as of November 2016) under IOM’s care regarding the changed Government of Australia policies on irregular maritime arrivals and dangers of sea pathways. Consequently, aside from an isolated case of an intercepted vessel, there have been no other attempts of irregular vessels leaving Indonesia since 2014.",positive
"Despite these challenges, project cost effectiveness and funds management remain commendable due to high project diligence.",positive
"Dignified and respectful accommodation and living conditions are provided, respecting basic Human Rights requirements in terms of assistance to be provided. Outcomes for the Government of Greece (GoG) are visible in the improved operational framework for managing irregular migration and return, with the adoption of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and improved infrastructure that supports the implementation of a fair and effective EU Return strategy.",positive
There was also an unexpected positive impact with a gradually improved mentality of the neighbourhood where the Centre is located.,positive
"Overall, IOM staff interviewed or surveyed found the Strategy to be relevant and beneficial for raising the awareness on the importance of the private sector and a framework under which to engage with the private sector.",positive
These have the potential to lead to a more sustainable engagement process with the private sector.,positive
"DRD implemented several activities to support offices such as guidance and tool development, providing direct funding for Country Offices to increase their own engagement and providing a significant portion of the allocated funds to USA for IOM to improve resource mobilisation.",positive
received funding from two Member States for the Strategy which was used to expand the reach of private sector engagement worldwide by directly funding 12 Country Offices.,positive
"supply chains, which were considered very positive and raised the visibility of IOM and migration.",positive
"During the first two years of implementation of the strategy, the focus has been on putting in place some key structural adjustments and guidance, such as the due diligence process, the guidelines on private sector engagement and strengthening USA for IOM.",positive
"In some cases, the outcome was seen as exceeding expectations, but in most cases it was considered in line with expectations. Some offices confirmed that the projects achieved the expected outcome bu",positive
"Sound management of the Facility, as is now the case, prevents abuse and potential problems regarding allocation of funds.",positive
"The evaluation concludes that no major changes should be made to the selection criteria and management guidelines, in order to keep the flexibility required for the Facility and avoid heavy approval mechanisms, such as the ‘Project Approval Board’ proposed by the informal group that at this stage do not guarantee more effective management of the Facility or better project performance.",positive
"IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) is currently updated to provide a better understanding of the movement needs of displaced children, through integrated CP indicators.",positive
"The surveyed IOM offices confirm that, with IOM support, stakeholders and governments have continuously and steadily improved and strengthened the local care and protection support capacities and the special treatment for the children.",positive
"There is a strong potential to contribute further to child protection assistance, which requires an investment for reinforcing IOM global institutional framework and policy, the production of reliable data and targeted capacity building for the field staff.",positive
"IOM’s operational management of child-oriented programmes has a positive global impact on the Organization in terms of data and research, policy and advocacy, assistance and protection, capacity building, prevention and crisis response.",positive
"The survey also noted the positive trend in prevention as such assistance is being increasingly provided through components including, for instance, school campaigns on trafficking in persons, textbooks for the primary schools including prevention of child trafficking and, most importantly, the children are being provided with messages to easily recognise the dangers of trafficking.",positive
It also helped to improve relationships within communities as the different ethnic groups had to work together for the benefit of the overall community.,positive
The EU-BK II programme completed 29 projects across 25 municipalities in Kosovo.,positive
"Furthermore, although it was not stipulated as part of the tendering requirements, some municipalities did conduct community meetings prior to proposing their projects thereby increasing community participation and ownership.",positive
"Nonetheless the programme overachieved in its targets indicating notable efforts by stakeholders to adjust implementation in order to address concerns, and strong outreach from IOM and its stakeholders to encourage people to apply.",positive
"n addition, municipalities provided 13% of the co-funding necessary for the projects thereby reducing the EU contribution requirements and allowing 29 projects to be funded.",positive
"Over EUR 4 million was disbursed into 25 municipalities, without any incidents of corruption, mistrust or complaints about the process or final outputs.",positive
"As a result of lessons learnt from Phase I, IOM included measures to increase sustainability in Phase II such as a commitment from the municipalities to maintain the sites over the course of three years at least with a related budget provision.",positive
"The Umbrella Letter of Understanding (ULOU) signed in April 2011 with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) aimed at improving efficiency and transparency, contributed to reducing the time required to disburse the funds to the field, enhancing further IOM rapid response capacity to emergencies.",positive
"The projects selection system through the UN Humanitarian Coordinator (HC)/Resident Coordinator (RC) and UNCT is generally well established, with IOM’s active participation when present in the country, OCHA also plays a role in coordinating and facilitating humanitarian response prioritization and subsequent UN funding appeals.",positive
"When working with local partners, IOM also aims to develop the operational and administrative capacities of the national NGOS recruited. In a few instances, governments have requested IOM to undertake specific emergency response interventions through CERF funding.",positive
"Examples include the partnership with UNHCR across a range of actions (CCCM, Shelter and NFIs, multi-sector for refugees); WHO and Health Cluster for health; FAO, UNICEF for the WASH cluster; Inter-Agency Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Working Group, among others. The partnership with OCHA, both overall and in multi-sector activities, is also effective but not directly linked to the use of CERF funds, as OCHA is not eligible to receive CERF grants. Effective partnership with the UN contributed to ensuring proper coverage of the initial response stages in emergencies, as projects were not endorsed and undertaken in a vacuum.",positive
"man rights are extensively covered by IOM projects, taking into account its operationally recognized protection role, and IOM has specific expertise in gender mainstreaming in emergencies.",positive
"As a project –based and field-driven organization, IOM has demonstrated its capacity to implement projects in emergency situations within many different contexts and crises, and its effectiveness is recognized by its donors, including the CERF Secretariat.",positive
"he evaluation also found that some UN agencies were asking IOM to be their implementing partner, given its generally timely field deployment capacity and broad expertise.",positive
"The Focal Point also ensures efficient information flow between IOM Field Offices, IOM Headquarters and the CERF Secretariat. The evaluation concludes positively on the functioning of the management of CERF projects in line with IOM procedures and CERF expectations.",positive
"Nevertheless, data revealed that most knowledge management efforts implemented since 2012 have been effective, with the most frequently reported changes and outcomes produced being enhanced efficiency, effectiveness and reporting of activities, consolidated and improved access to information and data, and improved quality of knowledge produced, stored and shared.",positive
"The reconstruction and rehabilitation works in the affected States of Chuuk and Yap totalled USD 41.5 million and resulted in 422 new homes built and 153 public infrastructure projects finalised. The start-up vouchers distributed to 1,355 families for USD 2.7 million also supported the rehabilitation of damages.",positive
"The process of revising the USAID Operational Blueprint (OBP) resulted in joint assessments, which now include: the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), USAID, state and national Governments as well as representatives from the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The established procedures enable the island nations to issue an appeal based on the identified priorities.",positive
"PREPARE’s relevance is evidenced in a close alignment with the governmental and international policy drivers for climate change, with the cross-sectoral nature of DRR, DRM and climate change, calling for a synchronised sectoral, regional and international cooperation.",positive
"The project effectively contributed to the strengthened preparedness for disasters in the provision of tools, materials and contingency plans already institutionalised by the island nations.",positive
PREPARE’s post-disaster emergency response following the devastating effects of the super typhoon Maysak in March 2015 in the Federated States of Micronesia was impressive.,positive
"Commendable flexibility exerted by the project to stay on track despite the adverse conditions in the Federated States of Micronesia is noted, especially in cases of a slow initial response of the Government to offer mitigation measures and conduct public outreach, in addition to the governmental changes, unmaterialized commitment to provide national vessels or information on public infrastructure.",positive
"The donor coordination, communication and visibility, as confirmed by the 5 | P a g e USAID Philippines and United States of America (US) Embassies in the countries, have been highly satisfactory.",positive
"Overall, a positive impact has been noted as the operational framework for DRR and DRM has been established following the tested SOPs, with the tabletop exercises now co-owned by the Federated States of Micronesia project partners, being included in the Government budget.",positive
"There are visible instances of increased local ownership, such as policies set aside under 2019 budget preparation to include larger allocations for DRM or national contributions increasingly provided to the organization of annual outer islands focal point workshops and tabletop exercises.",positive
he narrative and financial reporting coordinated by IOM with the other two partners and then submitted to ECHO was successfully done.,positive
"However, these minor coordination gaps had no impact on the overall delivery of the project.",positive
The Cluster was able to send experts to Country Offices requiring cluster support that did not have the technical knowledge or financial means to do so.,positive
"n addition, there have been some positive steps towards addressing coordination for example the co-lead assessment funded by the project, and the agreement to include a SAG. Cluster team members maintained good working relations and technical exchanges, correcting any potential delays or coordination gaps and ensured that results were met on time.",positive
The evaluation found that the design of Phase II was a continuation of the initial Phase and that there was a logical flow between both phases.,positive
"The evaluation analysed the logical framework applied to the project making some recommendations on improvements of the indicators, noting overall that the framework was well developed.",positive
"Finally, the division of labour between the three agencies was in line with their respective areas of expertise and interest; the project was designed so that most of the activities of each result could be implemented independently of the other results or contributions from the other agencies, with the notable exception of Result 2 which was implemented by both IOM and UNHCR.",positive
"Looking at the current IOM structures and standard procedures in place, the evidence suggests that these are facilitating a relevant use of the DTM and its institutionalization in the Organization.",positive
"This information, in turn, has informed IOM programmatic interventions and those of external partners, adapting these to the changing needs and displacement dynamics, as per the DTM data gathered.",positive
DTM has also informed stakeholder programming and facilitated the creation of partnerships with key stakeholders.,positive
"ooking at the institutional set-up and roles at IOM’s HQ, ROs, and COs, evidence reveals that these have proven effective for planning and implementing DTM activities.",positive
"For planning and implementing future DTM activities, debriefings and consultations with staff and partners are reportedly frequently used at HQ and COs to identify lessons learned and best practices to feed back into these efforts.",positive
"verall, the DTM has become the largest source of primary data on internal displacement.",positive
"Using a range of tools, methodologies, and technologies for the four components, the DTM has proven to be an effective and efficient system in providing donors, UN agencies, NGOs, and government partners with relevant, timely, and continuous data on displacement and the changing needs, locations, and vulnerabilities of IDPs.",positive
"mpact will be stronger with the attainment of independent funding sources and a reduction in the degree to which activities are projectized, as well as the development of a strategy for the DTM that clearly specifies the objectives of the DTM and the plan of action to be achieved in the long-term to guide current activities the HQ, RO, and CO levels.",positive
"ndeed, a section on MEFM containing the elements requested in Resolution No. 1229 is included in the Financial Report and the Annual Report of the Organization, both of which are submitted to the Council.",positive
It is interesting to note that operations that were not fully in line with the criteria for the use of MEFM were more successfully reimbursed.,positive
"n terms of reporting, IOM adhered to Resolution No. 1229 and paragraphs 19 to 22 of document MC/2335.",positive
"Resolution No. 1229 establishes a target balance of USD 30 million for the Mechanism, and fundraising efforts were made by IOM to reach this amount",positive
"Furthermore, the project was community-focused and in line with the Government strategies for the country. IOM PNG’s DRR efforts and strategy are also properly hinged to the IOM’s global approach to DRR.",positive
All five communities acknowledged that they felt more prepared to withstand a natural disaster.,positive
"OM developed videos in Tok Pisin3 and English to teach people about hazards and how to mitigate against them. IOM distributed pamphlets and encouraged use of traditional music, dance and drama to have community members interpret the knowledge gained.",positive
"his mutually beneficial relationship enabled communities to showcase their efforts and also to inform the public at large about disaster risk management and mitigation. IOM also conducted outreach in schools and market places on a more ad hoc basis. Whilst the outputs are easily measured,",positive
"wever the programme management team has been restructured to provide better support from the main office in Port Moresby to the provinces. Proper planning and adequate structures is key in light of the vastness of the country, the lack of transport options and hence the cost of operations countrywide.",positive
"n addition, IOM tries to maintain a relationship with the communities from previous phases.",positive
"Within the CBDRM approach, the project trained community facilitators and developed strong relationships with the communities, which was praised by most interviewees.",positive
OM adapted its CLS approach by providing this information during the visits to the communities.,positive
"Furthermore, IOM also raised awareness to the larger public through billboards, radio, print and TV messages and a successful partnership within the PNG public broadcasting station.",positive
"The project was designed in accordance with the Government’s own national development plan (the END), the SDGs, and together with relevant Government stakeholders. It also maintained sufficient flexibility to adjust to relevant changes to further advance the objectives, for instance, by providing the secondments to the key Government agencies and including the MGI methodology.",positive
"his plan, should it be finalized, will ensure a long‐term impact on addressing migration management within the Dominican Republic. ",positive
IOM has a comparative advantage to work with governments in better integrating migration into the SDG action and measurements.,positive
The use of an online platform for collecting the data related to the MGI. IOM was able to capitalise on the country’s internet access and literacy to ensure that various stakeholders could insert their data and feedback directly into a platform that facilitated discussions and analysis of the data. IOM has committed to providing the online platform to the National Institute of Migration so that it can be used for collecting data in the future. ,positive
"The secondments to the Government ensured a more effective and efficient support and allowed for capacity building and for a long‐term effort as the intention is that the positions will remain within the Government. Internally this allowed IOM to be more directly involved, have faster access to information and ensure that there was a full‐time staff member within the Government dedicated to the efforts. ",positive
The feasibility study conducted by the Government that IOM emulated for the inclusion of the MGI also provided a better understanding of the country’s gaps in measurement of the SDG indicators. ,positive
"Finally, it should be noted that the Government stakeholders were keen on sharing their experiences in integrating migration in the SDGs to other countries.",positive
Many staff will agree that the marker is strengthening the gender components of projects and interventions.,positive
"Despite shortcomings in capacity assessment, IOM’s substantive efforts in capacity building have strengthened considerably staff’s ability to mainstream gender across the Organization.",positive
Overall the evaluation finds that the organizational arrangements to support the implementation of the Gender Policy are adequate and have contributed to advancing gender mainstreaming in the Organization although this is not done consistently.,positive
The policy has contributed to sustainable changes in organizational culture.,positive
"Activities were implemented in various ways: under the direct leadership of the Deputy Director General, as initiatives stemming from the Gender Officer/Head, WGGI, from Headquarters departments, directly from IOM field offices, or sometimes from individual staff members.",positive
"The report concludes that IOM has been effective in implementing its gender policy and strategy for staffing; very interesting and successful results are recorded, such as the adoption of paternity leave and near parity proportions of male and female P staff.",positive
"Finally, in terms of global impact and sustainability, interesting cooperation was noted with other international partners and governments, and IOM should be more ambitious in contributing to the understanding of the dynamics of migration from a gender viewpoint and in playing a leading role in that field in close cooperation with other partners, such as UNFPA or UNDP.",positive
"OM is increasingly recognized as 2 a partner in the field of migration, gender aspects included, particularly since the UN High Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development.",positive
"e signing of a Memorandum of Understanding is an important act of partnership but only marks a milestone in partner relationships, with effective collaboration being the ultimate result.",positive
"The 2012/2013 annual report of the Office of International Oversight cited the work on Green Economy to be one of the most impactful within UN Environment. Also, regional fora like the African Ministerial Conference and the Committee of the African Heads of State have been influenced.",positive
"his positive trend is also reflected through the project level evaluations, where the criterion UN Environment Supervision and Management is showing high scores.",positive
Efforts by the substantive branch to reduce problems related to this and other administrative issues are ongoing and include pro-active peer-to-peer sharing and learning among Fund Management Officers. The Business Intelligence module has the potential to address some of the reporting needs of project staf,positive
"The theories of change for individual projects with a defined project period, a clear design stage and relatively clear activities, outputs, outcomes, intermediates states and impact are more widely used.",positive
"ndirectly, the work of these initiatives strengthens UN Environment’s contributions in the processes of G7 and G20, and regional fora such as the African regional Green Economy Program, as well as the dialogues with the global financial and economic fora and institutions.",positive
"During the period under review (2010-17), the Resource Efficiency Sub-Programme has made considerable progress in developing a robust and transparent results reporting system.",positive
"The Programme of Work 2018-2019 for the Sub-Programme is designed around 10, rather than the former 5, indicators giving more homogeneity in each indicator.",positive
he ‘Strengthened Regional Strategic Presence Policy’ was launched in June 2015 and changes in resource allocation have been taking place.,positive
"hese are helpful documents but need to appear more prominently and consistently in a central location5 , for example within the intranet platform WeCollaborate.",positive
"Themes of resource efficiency, sustainable consumption and production and, more specifically, inclusive green economy and sustainable finance have made their mark at a global level and are embedded in various initiatives of important global fora such as G7 and G20.",positive
"Larger projects have demonstrated the potential of concerted action by the RACs to develop policy, generate learning, to pilot new approaches and methodologies, and to link action on the ground to policy work.",positive
Nevertheless the evaluation found that the PoW interventions are foundational in nature with immediate outcomes expected to facilitate and enable onward contributions to the intermediate outcomes and impacts through compliance with the Barcelona Convention and Protocols and implementation of related strategies at the country level.,positive
"More positively there has been significant mobilisation of external resources in the programme period including through three major UNEP projects approved in 2012 (SWITCH-MED, ClimVar & ICZM and EcAp) and through ‘parallel’ projects and funding managed by the RACs.",positive
There has been significant delivery in all six thematic areas in line with the purpose of the PoW.,positive
"On the plus side, measures to address the deficit reinforced the ongoing effort to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the MAP system reform and MAP is now better positioned to meet future challenges.",positive
he development of the PoWs has been associated with the establishment of the Executive Coordination Panel bringing together the heads of all the RAC components and important ‘family building’ measure within the MAP system that has reinforced the perspective of the PoW as a single PoW rather than a collection of component PoWs.,positive
The evaluation findings suggest that UNEP has sought to mainstream gender into the core business processes of the organization.,positive
"NEP has achieved a higher women representation in staffing at 58% female and 42% male. At professional category, consisting of 44% female staff, the proportion of female staff is increasing with most significant increases at P2 and P3 level. At the highest level (USG/ASG and D2), gender balance has been achieved",positive
A clear set of criteria has been established and followed through with the engagement of the SGA and the gender focal points.,positive
"The UNEP Executive Director, Heads of Division and the recruitment review panel including the SGA played a positive role in achieving good progress in gender balance of staff.",positive
"UNEP has consistently worked with partners, including UN agencies at interagency level and the results of these collaborative efforts and alliances in various thematic areas on gender are very positive.",positive
This is a great improvement on previous PoW planning modalities.,positive
"ndeed, this evaluation found that while staff have complained about the ‘cumbersome’ processes associated with the matrix structure, interviews with Subprogramme Coordinators did reveal a perception that the level of inter- divisional discussion and collaboration has markedly increased as a result of the reformed PoW planning.",positive
"Despite these shortcomings, interviews with Sub- programme Co-ordinators did reveal a perception that the level of inter-divisional discussion and collaboration has markedly increased as a result of the reformed PoW planning process. There is also a perception that this enhanced collaboration and cooperation, where it occurs, has often happened despite the new planning processes being overly-complex.",positive
The strategic intent of the reform process has been clearly articulated in the Medium Term Strategy and programme documents and seem to be largely understood by staff especially Subprogramme Coordinators.,positive
"UNEP’s climate change work is strongly supported by UNEP mandates and decisions by the Governing Council/Global Ministerial Environment Forum. It is considered highly relevant to the recommendations of the IPCC and UNFCCC objectives, and key areas of cooperation have been agreed",positive
with the UNFCCC Secretariat in a joint work programme including strategic communications and support to international negotiations.,positive
"CCSP strategy largely focuses on achievements at the country level, but is also derived from relevance to global agreements and the need to devise, test and standardize tools and methodologies for specific environmental challenges with global applicability. Units of intervention vary widely across components. In the case of science and outreach the focus is more on global efforts in the context of the MEAs/climate negotiations. This is also the case for the REDD+ component.",positive
"For example, the Poverty-Environment Initiative (PEI) collaborates across various government actors, including powerful Finance Ministries, and the UN-REDD Programme engages UNDP, UNEP and FAO.",positive
"The proportion of POW outputs for which targets were achieved or exceeded slightly declined between the 2010/11 and 2012/13 biennia, mainly due to incomplete reporting on POW output indicators. Delivery of outputs across components presented a somewhat mixed picture. Over the two biennia, the output delivery ratio remained consistently high for EA(e) - Science and Outreach, made a marked improvement for EA(b) - Clean Energy - and lost some ground on EA(d) - REDD+. Delivery on output targets decreased the most on EA(c) - Energy Finance - where two out of three targets were not achieved",positive
"Overall, survey responses and interviews with UNEP staff and field visit partners viewed UNEP as becoming more effective by being more focused and strategic under the CCSP over the course of the period considered by the evaluation.",positive
"UNEP has promoted South-South cooperation for knowledge exchange and information sharing on adaptation. Platforms such as the Regional Gateway for Technology Transfer and Climate Change Action (REGATTA) in Latin America act as hubs for linking southern centres of excellence working on adaptation-related activities. Because of the complex and relatively new technical concepts and challenges that adaptation presents, hands-on support activities (thematic workshops, specific trainings, active knowledge exchange events) that connect actors with information are essential complements to more passive approaches to making knowledge available such as publications and websites.",positive
"These important analyses continue to inform climate change negotiations and new climate initiatives with mitigation components. Launched in 2009, the Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) project was entrusted to UNEP which provided, in collaboration with the Risoe Centre, support to 36 countries to prioritize mitigation sectors and technologies. To date, 32 countries have completed their TNA reports with UNEP’s assistance and 30 have also produced national Technology Action Plans (TAPs).",positive
"They are seen as good opportunities to information exchange, comparative analyses and mutual learning by both country representatives met during the field visits and by UNEP staff posted in the regional offices.",positive
"Piloting at the country level has been an important intervention strategy. At the UNFCCC COP 18 in Doha held at the end of 2012, UNEP was chosen to host and manage the Climate Technology Centre and Networks, created by the UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun, in collaboration with UNIDO and 11 leading technical organizations from both developing and developed countries",positive
"or example, research completed through CC-DARE contributed toward creating opportunities for integrating climate change adaptation into national development planning and decision-making in 11 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Small Island Developing States.",positive
"Where requested, UNEP provided assistance to the development of National Adaptation Plans of Action (NAPAs), but has also moved beyond broad plans into new specific arenas to inform governments and policies under the EbA approach, such as toward coastal ecosystems, urban settings and the agricultural sector.",positive
"Through participation on Joint Programmes with UNDP and FAO at the country level, UNEP has also been relatively successful in encouraging and influencing CC adaptation policies and strategies as was the case in the Philippines and Peru.",positive
"NEP and other partners facilitated direct engagement between government representatives, civil society, and climate change and finance experts to form comprehensive, national climate fiscal frameworks.",positive
UNEP also demonstrated the potential of management of agricultural landscapes for terrestrial carbon sequestration.,positive
"The first and second medium-term outcome are expected to contribute to improved resilience of vulnerable ecosystems and sustained ecosystem services under climate change, while the second and third are expected to contribute to reduced global GHG emissions.",positive
"The case for EbA is convincing as the approach has potential to deliver multiple co-benefits and help avoid mal-adaptation. The EbA approach is considered a “triple win” solution, since it can provide cost-effective risk reduction, support biodiversity conservation, and enable improvements in economic livelihoods and human well-being, particularly for the poor and vulnerable. Through the EbA approach, communities vulnerable to climate change have increased their resilience due to effective use of ecosystem services for adaptation and targeted measures.",positive
"Mature technologies such as solar water heating systems and energy saving light bulbs are increasingly adopted by countries. In most cases, it is the combination of progress in two or more of these areas that allowed countries to initiate a transition towards cleaner, more efficient and/or renewable energy use.",positive
"However, some projects have specific outputs intended to promote dissemination of best practices and lessons learned e.g. through climate change knowledge networks supported by UNEP. Capacity building of national and regional stakeholders is also a relatively common means for enabling replication. Despite these design shortcomings, there are several examples of projects where replication and upscaling are happening",positive
"Partners value UNEP for its in-house expertise as well as its access to targeted technical assistance through regional and global knowledge networks. UNEP is seen as playing a unique role in capturing, refining, summarizing and communicating lessons learned, tested methodologies, best practices and approaches to countries.",positive
"UNEP tries to encourage UN Agencies to systematically utilize UNEP tools and approaches, such as applying an EbA approach in the adaptation and REDD+ work of other UN agencies. Attempts are being made to mainstream EbA approaches in the work of other UN agencies and already UNDP and FAO are applying the EbA approach.",positive
Many mitigation projects involve the private sector directly or through industry associations and private sector engagement was key for the positive results achieved in energy finance related projects.,positive
"roject websites and online platforms are also a recurring tool used in all projects implemented by UNEP for sharing knowledge, presenting databases, technical guidelines, country case studies, etc.",positive
"However, technological advances and massive expansion of production capacity particularly in China have increased the competitiveness of RE and EE technologies.",positive
"he UN-REDD programme and other joint programmes by design sought to draw out the comparative advantages of each partner agency, though those collaborations have high transaction costs due to different administrative systems, reporting requirements, mutual consultation requirements etc.",positive
"The revised 2012/13 EAs have shown progress in terms of bringing clarity to intended results, and helping UNEP staff to communicate, both internally and externally, the relative value-added or niche of the CCSP. The changes provide some precision and realism to otherwise very ambitious objectives with a wide scope of work and variety of actors involved.",positive
"Despite these challenges and gaps, project documents were generally of higher quality under the POW 2012/13 in comparison with the previous POW. These noticeable improvements were due in part to better conditions (less time constraints and better guidance), but also the advent of a new Project Preparation Template for the 2012/13 POW and an enhanced PRC proces",positive
"UNEP staff have increasingly attended as one team, with more coherent common messages and backed by influential publications such as the Emissions Gap Reports prepared by the UNEP Chief Scientist with DTIE support since 2010. UNEP’s role and visibility in the UNFCCC process was also boosted by UNEP support to CC negotiators from developing countries since 2007 to reach a common regional position on the main issues under discussion during the COPs.",positive
"UNEP’s technical global studies, such as the Emissions Gap Reports, as well as national Technology Needs Assessments, are in high demand and have been very well received and respected by the international community and partner countries.",positive
UNEP appears to have been very successful in establishing knowledge networks on energy and climate change mitigation in several parts of the world.,positive
"Regarding technologies, efforts made by UNEP in terms of capacity building, awareness raising, production of proven scientific material and publications, have enabled countries to have access to and use cleaner, more efficient and renewable energy technologies.",positive
"In consultation with key ministry officials and relevant agencies, UNEP has been successful in supporting countries in their adaptation planning processes.",positive
"Notwithstanding, during the desk review and country visits the evaluation collected some anecdotal evidence which helps to illustrate UNEP contributions towards impact.",positive
"n addition, UNEP has relatively strong partnerships with other UN agencies for the purposes of particular interventions.",positive
This process was thorough but time-consuming and UNEP staff were generally favourable to this new way to deliberate on their collective vision of the CCSP.,positive
These flagship areas have (4 years later) motivated staff to focus efforts on specific problem/solution areas under the CCSP.,positive
rogress has been made in the last four years to implement results-based management (RBM) under the MTS.,positive
"The new MTS also presents service lines for UNEP which are directly derived from its comparative advantages, and along which many PoW Outputs would be forged during PoW development.",positive
"In the PoW 2014-2015, sets of indicators of achievement for the EAs often lack specificity or miss part of the results captured in the EA. For the PoW 2016-2017, several indicators have been added to provide a fuller picture of the changes and improve the accuracy of measurement",positive
This level of detailed planning has been emphasised and strengthened since the last formative evaluation. The bulk of the planning effort for the PFs in the 2014-17 MTS preceded the appointment of the current Sub-programme Coordinators.,positive
ProDocs have much improved in the way they present the project context and often contain a convincing problem analysis.,positive
"There is a strong alignment between UNEP’s C&W PoWs and UNEP’s mandate, also derived from major GC decisions.",positive
"he Sub-programme is consistent with UNEP’s technological support and capacity building mandate as set out in the Bali Strategic Plan (BSP), especially at the PoW Output level. Technological support and capacity building interventions include the development of various tools and methodologies for the sound management of C&W, and strengthening environmental law institutions and judicial systems (particularly in the context of MEAs).",positive
new themes being developed in the area of Health and Environment seem consistent with GC requests and global concerns about linkages between Environment and Health.,positive
"The Sub-programme has been largely successful in providing information and raising national awareness for the production and use of C&W in an environmentally sound manner. As a means of providing access to early warning information on emerging C&W issues, UNEP’s Global Chemicals Outlook (GCO) report, which was prepared during the period under review, recognized the importance of chemicals to sustainable development",positive
a). Integrating the sound management of chemicals into sustainable development strategies involves integration in development assistance programmes including UNDAF processes and mobilizing resources to implement activities that lower chemical risks. The UNDP-UNEP Partnership Initiative implemented activities to mainstream the sound management of chemicals into national development processes.,positive
National workshops on methods for assessment of cost of inaction and development of legislative frameworks were carried out in three countries between October 2012 and June 2013. Both outputs of the reports were to be included in the Global Chemicals Outlook after their discussion and approval at the 4th Steering Committee meeting of the Cost of Inaction Report held on 7 December 2011.,positive
"he UNDP-UNEP Partnership Initiative was effective in supporting the development of chemicals legislation and administrative processes, in providing advisory services for sustainable funding of the implementation and enforcement of the legislation. These successful outcomes in developing national legislation and regulations in line with international treaties need to be further up-scaled and replicated.",positive
"m the first biennium of the 2010-13 MTS period to the present, up to 80 countries have been addressing chemicals issues as a result of UNEP risk assessment information and tools.",positive
"The compendium covered data on waste oil generation and healthcare waste generation. Also, a step-by-step methodology for assessment of waste oil generation and healthcare waste generation was elaborated. Generic and specific technologies for the destruction of waste oils and healthcare waste were also compiled.",positive
"For example UNEP assisted Cambodia, Costa Rica and India to develop strategies to convert waste agricultural biomass into energy with the collaboration of businesses to upscale biomass waste to appropriate energy technologies.",positive
This was a result of earlier capacity building activities undertaken by UNEP.,positive
"p to June 2014, UNEP supported World Customs Organization (WCO) Operation DEMETER III focusing mainly on trans-boundary illegal shipments of hazardous and other waste covered by Basel Convention between Europe and Asia (including the GMS region). Demeter III resulted in 48 seizures and detentions with over 7,022 tonnes and 3,403 pieces of waste. The seized and detained waste ranged from textile waste, plastic waste, household waste, metal scrap, e-waste, to used vehicle parts and tyres.",positive
here has been an increase in the number of industries and industry associations engaging with UNEP. Negotiation towards a global legally-binding treaty on mercury was completed over the period covered by this evaluation.,positive
"The SAICM Secretariat also completed a number of activities such as meetings for the EU-JUSSCANNZ5 region and the Asia-Pacific region, the QSP Executive Board and the ICCM bureau. A number of other activities related to health and environment, mainstreaming, Chemicals and Information Exchange Network, Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals, support to parties to the Stockholm Convention in areas of POPs monitoring and updating national implementation plans, waste, and chemicals in products were also completed.",positive
"Nevertheless, specific programme activities undertaken by the Sub-programme have been shown to have the potential to cause the behavioural changes that will ultimately lead to impact. Indeed, there are signs of policy and regulatory outcomes which, over time, would lead to discernible impacts as a result of UNEPs work. For example Parties to MEAs will initiate action through mandating development of their own guidelines for use by their competent authorities and industry.",positive
everaging the strengths of key actors in the field makes possible a significantly higher development impact than UNEP could achieve on its own.,positive
"Coverage and engagement of SAICM has been broad. Projects funded by the QSP Trust Fund have contributed to the achievement of the 2020 goal of sound chemicals management by building national and regional capacity on sound chemicals management and supporting the implementation of SAICM objectives to reduce risk, disseminate knowledge and information and provide adequate governance.",positive
"The QSP has directly supported 10 countries in incorporating sound chemicals management into their national development plans, which has resulted, in some cases, in an increase in the volume of domestic resources dedicated to chemicals management. The evidence of SAICM’s contribution to the Expected Accomplishment is clea",positive
UNEP has established a strong strategic and policy foundation to strengthen UNEP’s strategic presence and the role of UNEP’s Regional Offices in programme implementation.,positive
"The Sub-programme is relevant to global agreements such as the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) Agenda 21 and the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), where the 2020 goal of producing and using chemicals in ways that lead to the minimization of significant effects on human health and the environment was established in article 23 of the Plan of Implementation of the WSSD.",positive
"NEP Governing Council approvals of the Medium Term Strategies (UNEP/GC.25/12, UNEP/GC.26/13 and GC.27/9) as well as approvals of subsequent programmes, in and of themselves, are evidence of consistency with UNEP and member state priorities.",positive
"The Government of Kazakhstan was also assisted in developing their chemicals legislation, administrative structures and sustainable funding of the implementation and enforcement of the legislation through the UNDP-UNEP partnership project on the mainstreaming of sound management of chemicals into their national development plan.",positive
"he methods of assessment of the cost of inaction have been tested, providing the impetus for the mainstreaming of the sound management of C&W into national development processes.",positive
"Besides work accomplished on the development of guidance on technological assessments and the compendia, limited additional work was accomplished in the area of waste.",positive
The Sub-programme undertook activities to combat environmental crime involving harmful substances and hazardous waste particularly in the Asia Pacific and West Asia.,positive
n this respect this project directly concerns the Basel Convention which criminalizes illegal traffic in hazardous waste and the Montreal Protocol for ODS. A range of partners including MEA secretariats are involved.,positive
"In 2013, Thailand reported 6 seizures in ODS cases.",positive
"he UNEP Secretariat has facilitated this, other inter-sessional work, and regional consultations requested at INC44 .",positive
"A number of Secretariat activities related to the implementation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury have been carried out such as the organisation of the first workshop in support of the ratification and early implementation of the Minamata Convention in March 2014 in Kuala Lumpur, and the preparation of INC5 and INC6 which took place in January 2013 and November 2014, respectively.",positive
"In spite of challenges faced in providing support to SAICM, taken together, the evaluation concludes that the level of delivery of the outputs related to SAICM implementation represents adequate secretariat support services to the ICCM and subsidiary bodies.",positive
fields of reducing reliance on DDT for disease vector control (with WHO) and environmentally sound management and disposal of PCBs.,positive
"This is consistent with UNEP’s strategy to scale up the use of guidelines, tools and methods that are pilot tested, not through growing a financial base but by working with key partners from the start, in particular other UN agencies with a stronger country basis, to help mainstream such tools and methods into their own programmes.",positive
Indeed one of the key outcomes of the Sub-programme which involves “mainstreaming” of the sound management of C&W into national development strategies is also a strong driver for governments to allocate resources to chemicals management in the UNDAF processes.,positive
"While the measurement of impact poses evidential challenges within the short term it would seem that, taken together, strengthened institutional capacity and continuing working on the mainstreaming of the sound management of chemicals into national development processes will produce sustainable impact in the long term.",positive
"At the national and regional level, these partnerships can play an important role in catalysing action.",positive
"aff appear to be competent, knowledgeable and enthusiastic; good energy and collegiality seems to exist within the Branch.",positive
roject monitoring was undertaken through the Project Information Management System (PIMS) and this evaluation has concluded that the information available in PIMS on project implementation has been quite useful.,positive
EA (C) had three of its four PoW outputs covered by an approved project document. All three PoW outputs under EA (D) were covered by an approved project document.,positive
the Evaluation notes important progress towards the four Expected Accomplishments that are attributable to specific initiatives.,positive
"This achievement was facilitated by a clear engagement strategy, a wise use of environmental review outputs, dedicated persistence of the UNEP DELC IEG team2 . These advances are considered examples of positive programmatic performance as they are the result of strategically assembling outputs of various divisions and working effectively within the formal and informal processes.",positive
"This positive influence on the Rio+20 agenda is the cumulative result of shared analysis and advocacy on long standing gaps noted by UNEP. There were also significant advances in harmonizing international environmental agreements on chemicals and bringing emergent issues - the green economy, black carbon and short-lived climate forcers- SLCFs, environment and human rights among others - to the attention of the international community",positive
Capacity building activities are strengthening the environmental awareness and enforcement capabilities of judicial systems in Africa and elsewhere. The publication of the Global Environmental Outlook (GEO-5) was,positive
"This will enable PIMS to track the completion of activities, delivery of outputs, and progress beyond them towards the achievement of Expected Accomplishments.",positive
"Overall, the DELC/IEG work in this area has contributed to a strengthening of UNEPs role in IEG.",positive
here is the general perception that communications are gradually improving between Divisions.,positive
Many staff members appreciate the introduction of PIMS as an accountability tool at project level.,positive
"During the period under review, UNEP supported several disaster‐affected countries in integrating environmental needs and priorities into recovery plans and, in a few cases, UNEP’s support went further and led to the preparation of stand‐alone environmental recovery strategies. Also in post‐conflict programme countries, UNEP has in some instances supported government agencies directly with the development or up‐dating of general and sector‐specific environmental strategies and plans. The D&C Sub‐programme has also directly promoted the use of assessment information for DRR planning in a limited number of countries, supported emergency preparedness planning as part of local APELL demonstrations, both in industrial parks and coastal tourism sites, and advised on the design of local, coastal protection projects. Planning for DRR has been indirectly supported as well, through a training initiative on Eco‐DRR in partnership with the Partnership on Environment and Disaster Risk Reduction (PEDRR).",positive
"UNEP assisted governments with improving a quite varied and dispersed set of laws, regulations, technical standards and guidelines. In post‐ conflict country programmes, UNEP also managed to influence regulatory frameworks through its assessments, research, advocacy and, sometimes, direct technical assistance. In some cases, UNEP has played an advisory role in key regulatory processes led by other development partners.",positive
"those quite dispersed cases, UNEP provided very specific technical advice to government and communities that were engaged in restoration and reconstruction efforts, contributing to their implementation skills. In the area of DRR and environmental emergency preparedness, implementation skills have been built in many demonstration sites",positive
"NEP is the focal point for environment in the UNDG, where it advocates for incorporating environmental issues in emergency and recovery policies, guidelines and operations. It is also the focal point for environment in the humanitarian coordination system, providing technical support to the humanitarian system to integrate environment into their programmes and plans",positive
"Through the Environment Network, UNEP has raised awareness, developed assessment tools, trained responders, provided technical assistance on environmental considerations and advocated for the inclusion of environmental components in Flash Appeals and Consolidated Appeal Process (CAP). The projects promoting environmental management for DRR have produced several communication outputs and held dissemination events to promote integration of environmental concepts and tools into policies and practices of international organisations, and there is already some evidence of effective influence by UNEP. The Environmental Cooperation for Peacebuilding (ECP) programme has been successful in introducing natural resources and the environment as both critical peacebuilding assets and potential sources of conflict in UN policy, guidelines and training curricula and kept track of these achievemen",positive
"re UNEP projects provided training and coaching linked to field demonstrations, e.g. with the APELL programme, or with coastal managers in Thailand and Indonesia, or on monitoring of industrial mining sites in Sierra Leone, behavioural changes might also have been triggered",positive
"As mentioned above, a piloting‐ and‐dissemination approach has been at the core of the prevention‐focussed Programme Framework 1. For instance, in the area of peacebuilding work, the ECP programme has produced many knowledge products to equip national stakeholders, the UN and the EU systems with the necessary awareness and tools and has made significant progress in establishing new partnerships and building a community of practice. The programme has created an active Expert Advisory Group on Environment, Conflict and Peacebuilding that leverages the technical expertise and networks of different organizations",positive
"e ECP also catalysed and is an active member of the UN Interagency Framework for Preventive Action which coordinates the EU‐UN Partnership on Natural Resources and Conflict. Eco‐DRR has been promoted in the first place by the projects developing the concepts and tools, through communication products, trainings and dissemination events, with encouraging results in terms of replication in‐country and statements of interest for replication by other countries.",positive
"platform serves as a forum for knowledge exchange, but has also, under UNEP’s leadership, prepared and started rolling out a training of trainers program on ecosystem‐based DRR.",positive
"There is frequent communication and exchange between the Sub‐programme Coordinator, Acting Sub‐programme Coordinator and the programme and project managers. The projects seem to enjoy a high level of trust and are given considerable freedom in terms of design and delivery of their interventions",positive
"Currently, reporting in the D&C Sub‐ programme, which is a shared responsibility between the project managers and the (Acting) Sub‐programme Coordinator, is quite systematic and standardized.",positive
"t the global level, the D&C Sub‐ programme has been very active in advocacy and training towards the UN and other international agencies to bring the environment on the forefront of DRR, recovery and peacebuilding approaches.",positive
"These relationships are absolutely essential for improving accident prevention and emergency preparedness. In environment‐DRR demonstration countries, the PCDMB team has also somewhat promoted collaboration between the traditional DRR institutions (National Centres for DRR, civil protection agencies etc.) with environment‐related agencies by involving them both in training sessions and, where possible, in field demonstration projects",positive
The PEDRR partnership – a mix of international environment and disaster/emergency agencies – is currently the main instrument to up‐scale eco‐DRR outside the pilot countries.,positive
"here are a few exceptions, where projects have some form of a formal advisory or steering group such as ENVSEC or ECP.",positive
The D&C Sub‐programme has developed an exemplary Resource Mobilization Strategy since 2009 which has been regularly updated with the evolving context of humanitarian and development aid financing.,positive
The longstanding partnership between UNEP and OCHA through the Joint Environment Unit to conduct rapid environmental assessments is very useful because OCHA’s operational procedures and the UNDAC mechanism are designed to mobilize experts and logistics at much shorter notice than UNEP procedures would allow.,positive
UNEP’s collaboration with the UNCTs has been quite strong as regards identifying environmental risks and integrating environment in the recovery plans.,positive
"There is a recognised need for increased capacity to tackle the management and restoration of ecosystem services and the mainstreaming of the ecosystem approach into development and economic policy areas, while ecosystem services assessments, particularly ecosystem valuation studies and natural capital accounting, are proving increasingly important in helping to prioritize investment in environmental interventions as part of development and financial assistance frameworks.",positive
"The EMSP is also well aligned with UNEP’s mandate as expressed in several UN General Assembly Resolutions and Reports, UNEP Governing Council Decisions and UNEP’s Medium-Term Strategy 2010.",positive
On the other hand the broad nature of the EAs has offered a degree of flexibility to accommodate emerging issues.,positive
"UNEP has a comparative advantage in the area with a long history of, and identifiable expertise in, ecosystem management.",positive
"However, if contributions by individual EMSP projects to all the EAs are considered (as is the case for the final PPR of the 2012-2013 biennium), and not just restricted to the EA they are associated with in PIMS, then all three EAs can be judged to have achieved their targets.",positive
"apacity building efforts have often been extended through partner initiatives, such as through the Regional Seas Programme and the GPA.",positive
"Several key publications have resulted from EMSP activities, including the widely praised Inclusive Wealth Report (2012), Green Economy in a Blue World Technical Report and various reports from The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) project, and the ‘UNEP Policy Series on Ecosystem Management’ publications available on the UNEP website.",positive
"The evaluation found some evidence of successes, notably in relation mainstreaming ecosystem management into development policy and planning.",positive
"However, there is evidence of improved enabling conditions (institutional, legal and policy) for integrating ecosystem approach into development, economic and financial planning and decision-making frameworks (MTO2). The EMSP has helped countries to identify ecosystem management needs, and supported the formulation of national policies, strategies and plans that integrate ecosystem management approaches into environment, development, and economic and financial sectors. UNEP has also helped strengthen existing sector-specific regulatory frameworks, with good results from several projects.",positive
"UNEP assessments and reports addressing the value of ecosystem services and natural capital are considered to have considerable potential to improve national economic and development strategies and policies. UNEP’s work in this area, notably through the high profile TEEB project, is considered to have made the benefits of ecosystems more visible to economics, and helped encourage countries to move towards a green economy",positive
"Nevertheless, there have been a few encouraging signs of success at a local scale including restoration efforts in Mau Forest and along the Tana River in Kenya, at Lake Faguibine in Mali and through the GRASP and Lifeweb projects.",positive
Another factor responsible for the effectiveness and efficiency of the more successful EMSP projects has been the development and cultivation of strong partnerships since partners often have a better knowledge and understanding of the local situation than UNEP.,positive
"Many of the EMSP’s outputs are policy guidelines, briefings, handbooks and other documents for use by governments and other decision-makers, and a certain degree of ‘sustainability’ can be said to have been achieved once these have been adopted or mainstreamed into relevant policies, plans and legislation (although their implementation is up to governments or partners and outside of UNEP’s direct control). Furthermore, many of the tools developed or assessments undertaken by the EMSP projects have been captured in reports and publications that are available for download to other institutions involved in capacity development for ecosystem management, which supports sustainability and replication of project results.",positive
"The EMSP has also played a catalytic role by assisting some countries to accede to key multilateral environmental agreements, notably the Nagoya Protocol (in collaboration with the EGSP) and supporting countries to fulfil their obligations under various conventions, particularly CBD commitments, although this has been limited.",positive
"However, the quality of project documents has improved over the MTS period.",positive
"owever, new organisational arrangements put in place during the first months of 2014 as well as the increased seniority of SPCs are expected to contribute substantially to resolving these issues.",positive
"Consequently, there is a good organizational memory among EMSP project staff, and to a large degree the EMSP has developed around the existing expertise within DEPI. EMSP staff were competent and capable",positive
"Nevertheless, there are examples where UNEP has been able to identify priority areas that can be supported in an appropriate timeframe. The evaluation notes that new project concepts (to deal with emerging issues) can be approved by SMT to be added to a Programme framework at any time.",positive
"but has improved over the MTS, notably with the introduction of milestones, although there is insufficient evaluative evidence on project performance and progress towards immediate outcomes and impact.",positive
"UNEP’s global normative work, such as work of the TEEB project and the marine programme within the EMSP, is considered to have greater potential for long-term results and impact than activities at a local level as the former plays to UNEP’s mandate and comparative strengths, such as its significant convening power to help move processes such as IPBES forward.",positive
"Prospects for institutional sustainability have also been supported by the EMSP’s development, support and promotion of various knowledge networks to encourage information exchange, peer learning, and the transfer of experience on ecosystem management and restoration, such as the Sub-Global Assessment (SGA) network and the IPBES.",positive
EMSP projects succeeded in establishing good external partnerships.,positive
"ndeed, the most significant progress has been made in IWRM where the government has been most responsive to policy change, and to livelihoods (particularly pastoralism) where UNEP has found the most committed and complementary partnerships.",positive
"The evaluation recognised UNEP’s catalytic role in shaping and promoting policy dialogue, noting that, among other things, exchange visits to east Africa (Kenya and Tanzania) and South Africa were an important impetus. One outcome is the way in which IWRM is becoming embedded in national policy, with the elevated status of the Groundwater and Wadis Department within the MWRE. Another is the on‐going development of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) with the HCENR at both federal and state levels of government; this has been particularly useful in pushing the climate change agenda and should result in Sudan being able to access funding from the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change",positive
The collaboration with UNICEF in monitoring ground water in IDP camps in Darfur has also been a clear success. And UNEP is currently fostering stronger links with UNFPA on population dynamics and the environment through closer coordination and collaboration with the National Population Council (NPC).,positive
and UNEP/UNOPS/DFID have recently approved a survey of all failed dams in Darfur so that future implementing agencies can have a better understanding of conditions there.,positive
In 2011 UNEP was able to introduce a pilot environment ‘marker’ for projects registered in Sudan and vet them against a set of basic environmental good practice principles.,positive
"ncluded in the model is a demonstration of REDD+ work. With the national NGO Darfur Reconstruction Agency (DRA) seven villages were selected for the pilot. Two had fully developed CEAPS by the end of 2011 and one more was under development at the time of evaluation. Looking ahead, the FNC has indicated an interest in developing a further 20 CEAPs in Darfu",positive
"Gender‐sensitivity training was included in, for example, the IWRM component of SIEP. Gender disaggregated data is available for various outputs and capacity building activities assert the need to ensure gender‐balanced participation",positive
The recent UNEP review of environmental governance in Sudan has helped to map out what these governance institutions are and the relationship between them. What is needed now is a more concerted effort to explain (a) how these institutions function internally; (b) how policy decisions are made; (c) how such policy is used at federal and state levels; and (d) the extent to which UNEP attribution/contribution towards policy change can be asserted.,positive
"Supporting a very high number of countries worldwide to prepare and adopt a National Biosafety Framework; - Creating and/or improving their capacity to fulfil their rights and obligations towards the Cartagena Protocol; - Laying the foundations for more comprehensive and effective actions of Capacity Building at National level; - Largely contributing to fulfil UNEP’s mandate and policy, yet without being formally part of a strategic framework at UNEP level; - Meaningfully contributing to fulfil GEF strategy and priorities. (see 4.1.1)",positive
"The innovative character of the Project, its complexity and the urgency of its implementation did not probably allow a better preparation. Preparation and Readiness has to be rated Moderately Satisfactory (MS). (see 4.6.1)",positive
"That has been a formidable task, requiring assiduous work of training and coaching, data corrections and revisions and of system upgrading. Financial Management has been up to the strong challenge and is rated Satisfactory. (see 4.6.5)",positive
he MTE took place as planned. Project Monitoring capacity has been rated Satisfactory (S). (see 4.6.7),positive
"Overall, the progress towards NBF implementation and the consolidation of the Biosafety Programme can be rated Moderately Satisfactory.",positive
"Considering the scope and complexity of the Project, outputs delivery has to be considered Satisfactory (S).(see 4.2 and Table in Ann.13)",positive
"The Project overall has triggered a global and coordinated process to enable the Parties to fulfil CPB obligations, tough with variable results.",positive
"Considering the baseline situation, the progress of the National Biosafety Frameworks has been quite remarkable.",positive
The Project has represented the starting point of a growing process of capacity and institution building and has unquestionably played a catalytic role. (see 4.4.6),positive
"he project included two separate, but mutually dependent impact pathways: one focusing on the development and effective communication of a convincing case for Green Economy at global level, while the second targets the design of regulations, economic incentives, and voluntary measures promoting environmentally sound technologies and resource efficiency at country level. The achievement of the outcomes and objectives at global and regional level (impact pathway 1) was notably higher than at country level (impact pathway 2), where the project had to deal with many more implementation challenges. Nonetheless, also at country level there was ownership and a clear change in attitude of different partners. Therefore, although the project partially achieved outcomes at national level, the sustainability and likelihood of impact was nevertheless positive. Of the seven sub-projects that were evaluated, five received the rating 'satisfactory', and two 'moderately satisfactory'.",positive
"The main reasons for good output delivery were (i) the effective mobilization of funds, (ii) the overall good project management, and (iii) the innovative character and high relevance of the concept of Green Economy, ensuring global attention, country ownership and collaboration of key institutions.",positive
"This effectiveness is a result of (i) the academic leadership of UN Environment, (ii) effective communication and lobbying, (iii) effective partnerships with key agencies, (iv) inter-sectorial coordination within countries and (v) commitment of countries to transition to GE.",positive
"The project managed to bring the concept of Green Economy to the international development debate, while assisting dozens of countries in their initial efforts to transition to more resource efficiency, sustainable consumption and production.",positive
"The GE Project was successful in bringing the Green Economy Initiative to another level: starting as an innovative concept that was promoted in the international development debate, it transitioned into a global project that assisted approx. 50 countries, branched out to several new UN Environment initiatives, inspired others and established global partnerships.",positive
"The project effectively achieved its outcomes, as defined in the project documentation7.",positive
"Overall, the Project achieved a change in the attitude of countries, rather than in action: although there are few concrete examples of GE in practice, country ownership and UN Environment support resulted in the development and, in some countries, acceptance at a policy level such as GE action plans, implementation plans, or inclusion of GE in development policies.",positive
"Project stakeholders have contributed through the Project outputs and outcomes importantly towards prioritisation of sound management of mercury in the Russian Federation, plus also to the fulfilment of UN Environment’s mandate and GEF strategy and priorities. The evaluation found all interviewed stakeholders and all respondents to the survey agreeing that the Project was strategically relevant for the Russian Federation.",positive
The Peer review mechanism used can be regarded as a guarantee to assure the quality of the outputs.,positive
he combined immediate outcomes have strongly supported the Russian Federation in its preparations to join the Minamata Convention and strengthened the key stakeholders in dealing with mercury issues. Mercury releases have been identified (and described analytical Project reports that prioritise the pollution sources) using the international best practice approach of UN Environment. The results enable national stakeholders to better understand mercury risks for human health and the environment. Based on the Project experience in the Russian Federation regional colleagues in FSU countries are assisted in carrying out the Minamata Initial Assessments and other relevant mercury project,positive
This Problem was solved after the two Project extensions were agreed to.,positive
"he monitoring and reporting practice has, however, improved after the initial phase of the Project, when monitoring and reporting was carried out in a more timely fashion with adequate attention to content and detail.",positive
The efforts of Project stakeholders to secure Project sustainability are regarded by the evaluator as satisfactory.,positive
he Project agreements proved to be of great value for the necessary data gathering of the inventory. The partnering organisations actively facilitated dialogue with companies and assisted to get access to plants.,positive
"This evaluation found that in respect to the Quality of Project design, the Project has a comprehensive, coherent logical framework that contributes towards the Project objective in both content and process.",positive
The Terminal Evaluation has found that the Project has succeeded well in providing the best environmental practices and guidelines for control of mercury releases in the Russian Federation.,positive
In the Mid-term review of the Project the international mercury expert Jakob Maag even characterizes the Project as the best implementation of the MIA toolkit to date.,positive
"The project is well anchored in the Rio+20 Conference outcome document that acknowledged the importance of promoting green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication and called for the development of platforms to contribute to coordinating and providing information on green economy tools, best practices, models and methodologies. Since the Rio+20 Conference the concepts of green growth and green economy have gained traction in national-level projects, policies, and global initiatives",positive
he GGKP has been particularly effective at delivering expected outputs in a short timeframe despite limited financial resources.,positive
The GGKP Research Committees have published 9 scoping analyses. Founding members and knowledge partners have produced or commissioned 24 working papers for the GGKP to help identify and prioritize complementary knowledge gaps. The project has also harnessed and enabled the sharing of 98 research papers and 29 slide presentations through the GGKP Annual Conferences,positive
"The GGKP website has become a visible platform that has received on average close to 10.000 visits per month during the third quarter of 20162 . In 2016, a total of 14,735 publications were downloaded from the GGKP Resource Library. Users of the web platform positively assess the relevance of the content provided as well as th",positive
"Nevertheless, the project was able to attract experts producing “insight” blogs discussing and describing relevant green growth research and activities for the GGKP web platform.",positive
Reference to the use of GGKP assessment and reports were found through the evaluation survey and online search. Google Scholar returned 385 articles on “Green Growth Knowledge Platform,positive
"According to the GGKP Users survey conducted by the evaluation, more than 70% of respondents indicated either a high or significant contribution of the GGKP to informing programmes, projects, publications, research, monitoring systems, or training and education activities and 55% to developing and/or adopting, and implementing green growth practices. About 46% of the users reported a high or significant contribution of the GGKP to Improving national policies, strategies, or legislative frameworks. Anecdotal evidence was collected about adoption of the GGKP transacted knowledge in research programmes and national strategies.",positive
"Nevertheless, in terms of financial sustainability the GGKP has recently benefited from a commitment of funding for six-years, which secures a sound financial foundation together with GGGI’s core financing and the annual contributions of Switzerland and the Netherlands, in addition to the funding provided by the Norway, Sweden, and Germany.",positive
"Evidence was found of the GGKP having supported policymakers and other relevant actors to develop, adopt, and implement green growth policies and practices.",positive
"hese considerations have induced the Evaluation Team to upgrade the Effectiveness rating to Moderately Satisfactory, as explained in chapter 5.4.2 (§ 83) and in Table 10 (chapter 6.1.1).",positive
"Guidelines and application forms for processing request have been prepared and Risk Assessment workshops have also been organised. Specific “Guidelines for Monitoring and Enforcement of Environmental Impacts of Living Modified Organisms” have also been drafted, as well as “Customs Guidelines for Transboundary Movement of LMOs into Liberia”.

"Workshops on “Public Participation and Decision-making” have been organised in three different regions of the country to inform and debate on the implementation and challenges of the National Biosafety Programme. A Biosafety/Biotechnology Curriculum has been developed and mainstreamed into the Graduate Program of the University of Liberia and a course has started at the Department of Biological Sciences (certificate and degree levels), with 32 students enrolled.",positive

"Substantial support and technical backstopping were provided to the local implementing partners by both the Project Team and external sector experts. During implementation, the Project Team practiced adaptive management to facilitate learning and seize opportunities although occasional gaps in communication and mutual understanding led, at times, to a perception on the part of local partners of shifting goalposts.",positive
"Substantial in-kind contribution from local implementing partners enlarged the available resource pool. This approach is in line with the principle of building on existing institutions, partnerships, and initiatives, which contributed to project efficiency. At times, the level of in-kind contribution exceeded the expectation and capacity of local implementing partners. The novelty of the eco-innovation approach and the extra effort needed by all involved actors to come up the learning curve were factors driving higher than expected in-kind contributions.",positive
Its impact through replication and upscaling is seen as moderately likely.,positive
This is an important achievement within the broader context of sustainability in global business and the policy context with the emergence of Circular Economy.,positive
"Local implementing partners and Steering Committee members have signalled their intention to leverage the pilot experience. Near the Project’s closure, entities in Argentina,",positive
"Brazil, Colombia, Panama, and France indicated their interest and advanced on their intentions to implement the approach. These are very promising signs indeed.",positive
"The Project developed a novel approach to integrating sustainability thinking into a firm’s business model that brings together RECP practice, life cycle and systems thinking, and a value chain perspective.",positive
"The Project's direct outcomes, as defined in the R-TOC, were delivered.",positive
"We regard this as noteworthy while recognising the increasing global concerns with sustainability is likely putting some wind in the sails of the International Resource Panel, and also recognizing that many of the potential policy audiences for their work are still forming. While the evaluation finds evidence of steady contributions to polic",positive
the evaluation is that the International Resource Panel is highly relevant and an important element in efforts to achieve a sustainable future.,positive
nternational Resource Panel is contributing to policy deliberations especially at global levels.,positive
The overall evaluative assessment of the work of the International Resource Panel is that it is satisfactory.,positive
"This was supported by the fact that UNHCR and partner organisations (as part of the common cash facility or CCF) were able to realise economies of scale and negotiate an impressive reduction in bank fees with the financial service provider, which meant that bank fees represent just 1.3 percent of the total cash amount going to beneficiaries. This compares favourably to other contexts where fees can be over five percent.",positive
"hen they are delivered through digital payment systems. These have potential for major cost savings compared to manual cash distribution modalities which entail variable costs for the storing and organisation of cash, transport and security. These efficiencies are further emphasised using digital and biometric technologies, which are seen as best practice internationally.",positive
he use of biometric registration procedures and biometric technology at ATMs further ensures cash assistance gets to the intended people as possibilities for fraud and other leakages are substantially minimised.,positive
"• Recipients of UNHCR cash show an increase in total expenditure, and most importantly and increase in the expenditure on health and education. Historically, reported value of debt has been lower with those households who are receiving UNHCR cash",positive
"UNHCR CBI leads to a statistically significant increase on education expenditure. Transportation costs are a key driver of education expenditure, along with the number of children missing school",positive
"Recipients of UNHCR cash are likely to have a higher total income per month. Dietary diversity is also associated with a higher total income, and is itself increased by provision of UNHCR cash",positive
"ecipients of UNHRC cash are likely to generate more income, and to incure higher expenditures. Between 2014 and 2017, there has been a shift towards a positive differential between income and expenditure across households (i.e. families are left with additional funds after all costs are incurred)",positive
"In conclusion, the synthesis of existing evidence and statistical analysis allows us to conclude that the CBI programme either fully or partially fulfils all of the key benchmarks considered.",positive
"Eventually, all acknowledged that UNHCR had played a lead role in the assistance and protection of refugees.",positive
"Although difficult to measure, the QIP has made some valuable and demonstrable contributions to promoting and developing a fairer asylum system and stateless determination procedure.",positive
"Among them is the 2015 HO Asylum Policy Instruction (API) on credibility assessments, which reflects UNHCR standards. The QIP also worked closely with other stakeholders in areas such as improving the adjudication of asylum claims brought by Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual (LGB) 7 individuals and developing a mechanism for identifying survivors of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) at the earliest stage possible and signposting them for appropriate support services.",positive
"Overall, the QIP effectively carried out its activities and moved towards meeting its objectives.",positive
"And while this achievement cannot be attributed directly to the introduction of UNHCR’s 2009 policy on refugee protection and solutions in urban areas, the policy has played an important role in validating the strategy that was already being pursued by the organization’s office in Kuala Lumpur.",positive
Training facilitated by the protection cluster and advocacy within the HCT resulted in a heightened awareness of protection principles among humanitarian actors.,positive
"The consensus amongst peer UN agencies and International Non-governmental Organisations (INGO) was that UNHCR had added value but not optimised their comparative advantage. Staff based in DRC from the United Kingdom (DFID), the European Union (ECHO) and Switzerland (SDC) interviewed claimed there was a lack of clarity about UNHCR’s role in the IDP crisis.",positive

UNHCR-led coordination mechanisms were strategically positioned in L3 areas by April 2018.,positive
The protection cluster contributed to the response by increasing the understanding of humanitarian actors of protection needs and by building capacity of national actors.,positive
UNHCR’s investments eventually resulted in a more strategic approach to shelter coordination in eastern DRC and the Kasais after the L3 emergency had been discontinued.,positive
The protection cluster drew OCHA’s attention to early warning signals that pointed to a deterioration of the situation in the Kasais as early as August 2016.,positive
UNHCR nonetheless did not wait for a L3 declaration but took steps that helped to position themselves to scale up once the system-wide L3 had been declared.,positive

his should strengthen the RSD system for the future and make it less dependent on inputs from UNHCR through its observer role in many eligibility bodies.,positive
Experience shows that political buy-in and national ownership are key ingredients for establishing well-functioning and sustainable RSD systems.,positive
Country offices often tend to focus their energy and resources on influencing legislation and capacity building through training.,positive
"Country offices seem to be well aware that, before and after the transfer of the RSD function, States as well as UNHCR need to avoid policies that will put pressures on new RSD systems which these cannot reasonably handle.",positive
"In some countries, notwithstanding the seriousness and humanitarian spirit with which national RSD is conducted, there is room for more UNHCR initiative to involve national actors of protection.",positive
"The prioritisation process was considered to offer an important opportunity to strengthen coordination as well as highlighting gaps in response. While the difference between UNHCR’s programme-based approach and the CERF secretariat’s project-based approach requires an investment of time and resources to manage CERF funds, the benefits to UNHCR far outweigh the costs.",positive
"Organisational systems to scale-up partnerships to respond to new crises were considered to be broadly effective and where country-defined CERF processes permitted, UNHCR engages with its partners in agreeing priorities and designing projects.",positive
"There is little doubt that in addition to contributing to the effectiveness of the secretariat, this secondment has played an important role in helping to strengthen mutual understanding between the two organisations.",positive
"The CERF is of considerable relevance to UNHCR. Given its humanitarian mandate which requires a timely response to crises, the CERF is considered by many to be unique in the speed and predictability of its mobilisation",positive
"Despite it being located outside of the clusters, multi-sector has attracted considerable funding and CERF has offered the opportunity for UNHCR to advocate to the wider humanitarian community about refugee needs and to involve them in decision-making when inclusive approaches have been adopted for CERF prioritisation.",positive
"While the review did not seek to assess the results of CERF funding on beneficiary populations and hence cannot make any judgments on programme effectiveness, the data held by the CERF secretariat on procedural compliance suggest that UNHCR has been a responsible steward of CERF funding which it uses in a timely way and that it has systems in place to spend to budget and within project timeframes.",positive
There is currently a strong cadre of CERF-aware staff in the organisation and there is little evidence of missed opportunities for participating in CERF processes.,positive
"At the same time, however, transition of RSD responsibility to national authorities highlights the vital importance of, as well as the many challenges associated with, mobilising the capacity and willingness of the state to offer protection in line with international obligations.",positive
Small numbers are repatriating voluntarily and UNHCR has carefully and correctly dissociated itself from observing involuntary returns.,positive
"but during 2014 and 2015 was adapting - first by building up community centres, and then by ramping up Community-Based Protection grounded in an Urban Strategy.",positive
"To a considerable extent, this was enabled by the patient, low-key and flexible support of UNHCR protection staff, and in particular a rather unique policy and advisory team of national officers in the Policy Development Unit.",positive
"strategic communications, are already part of UNHCR’s Turkey Urban Strategy and of the 3RP.",positive
"Overall, UNHCR has contributed significantly to the protective environment for Syrian refugees in Turkey, particularly by focusing on the legal and institutional framework needed for Syrians to be registered and to access social services.",positive
"The agency was quick to mobilize, deploying protection, shelter and field officers early, which enabled UNHCR to gain strategic advantage and advocacy leverage. UNHCR’s principled stand on access to NGCAs paved the way for UN agencies to remain engaged in the NGCAs, and the agency was largely successful in preventing the creation of IDP camps in the country as well as demonstrating the efficiency of cash‐based interventions",positive
"NHCR was able to remain neutral and impartial as a Cluster Lead Agency (CLA), fulfilling its role as an effective and trusted cluster coordinator. The protection cluster is considered by stakeholders to be strong on advocacy, while the shelter cluster was widely regarded as one of the best coordinated clusters in Ukraine. Both have adapted to the specifics of the Ukraine context as the situation as evolved",positive
"In general, coordination with government, UN agencies, donors and operating partners has been uniformly good and there is a unique opportunity for UNHCR to build on its relations with UN development agencies to advance IDP solutions.",positive
"The programme, under UNHCR’s humanitarian track, is non-political and is designed, in line with UNHCR’s mandate, to address the protracted situation of Sahrawi families separated by the conflict for nearly 40 years, that is between the family members who reside in the remote camps near Tindouf, South West Algeria, and those in the Western Sahara Territory.",positive
These activities could also help to bring about a solution for these families and to establish a certain level of confidence among the concerned parties.,positive
"In February 2011 and January 2012 at the high-level meetings in Geneva on Confidence Building Measures, the parties (i.e. the Kingdom of Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO) and the two neighbouring countries, Algeria and Mauritania, reiterated their support for UNHCR to organize an evaluation mission of the CBM programme to assess the humanitarian impact of this programme and its relevance in complementing the efforts of the UN in finding a political solution that would allow the refugees to return to their places of origin.",positive
"While fully recognizing the intractable nature of this refugee situation, there are a number of areas in which UNHCR could take some constructive steps.",positive
"In the three years of reintegration, little evidence of duplication appears.",positive
"n selecting its strategy and goals of the community empowerment program, UNHCR correctly focused its efforts on two of the most damaged districts, Kono and Kailahun, and on the important border districts of Kambia, Kenema, and Pujehan.",positive
"ithin the 2 districts that it operated, UNHCR integrated returning refugees and former internally displaced persons without discrimination and promoted community solidarity.",positive
"In terms of sectors, the education and community services sector had the highest overall ratings.",positive
"In regard to specific types of projects, the five that garnered the highest ratings were secondary schools, GBV Centres, primary schools, water wells, and rice drying floors.",positive
"As part of its CEP activities, UNHCR implemented a number of special gender projects which benefited women and proved to be remarkably sustainable.",positive
"Overall, the CEP program had a direct and substantial impact on Sierra Leone.",positive
"UNHCR‟s work, in turn, formed a bridge to other development activities, especially those by the World Bank/GOSL and UNICEF in the areas of education and child welfare.",positive
"The CEPs also acted as a catalyst for future community development, especially when this activity was supported by actions of the government of Sierra Leone or continued by international NGOS.",positive
"UNHCR‟s catalytic role can be best seen in its sponsorship of entrepreneurial activities, agricultural productivity, and GBV centres for women and girls.",positive
"In order to enhance its role as a catalyst, UNHCR should take targeted actions to add to the sustainability of select CEPs, sponsor additional entrepreneurial activities, and facilitate more systematically the preparation of its national staff for future roles in peacebuilding.",positive
Some have even managed to acquire Sudanese identity documents.,positive
"While the refugees continue to be assisted by UNHCR, food distribution has been reduced and many refugees appear to have found a way of sustaining themselves, often by means of agriculture or informal labour.",positive
"CIREFCA also contained peacebuilding components of dialogue and reconciliation at all levels. In El Salvador our office had played a leading role in restoring personal documentation to hundreds of thousands of people. In 1994, democratic elections produced a government with representatives of the former insurgents in office locally and in the national Congress.",positive
"As I prepared to leave my post as UNHCR Chief of Mission in El Salvador at the close of 1993, I had reason to feel proud of what our office had achieved.",positive
The refugees and IDPs organized themselves and shared dreams of collective progress.,positive
"Quick impact projects, QIPs, still an important tool of early recovery strategies today, were first tried in Central America.",positive
"On the positive side, many of the refugee leaders of that time are still active and politically engaged, as are the leaders of the grassroots organizations that supported them during the return process.",positive
"he evolution has been significant, 3 and is most evident in the fact that it has become a lead agency for IDP issues in several countries, including the ones covered in this report.",positive
This has been crucial in implementing the Urban Policy.,positive
The creation of the Administrative Immigration Tribunal is still an important pending issue whilst regulations for the new law are urgently required and have not yet been promulgated - UNHCR has worked closely with the government on a draft proposal that is now being assessed by the government internally.,positive
"Working in partnership with the municipality, UNHCR has tried to avoid a parallel system for refugee support and instead promoted an integrated approach whereby refugees are treated at least equally and with the same rights, as the other inhabitants of the city.",positive
"Asociación de Profesionales en Desarrollo (APRODE) is a micro-finance institution with extensive experience in the field of self-employment.  Pastoral Social-CARITAS Costa Rica (CARITAS) identifies and refers refugees to UNHCR and other partners, in the provinces of San Jose (Rincon Grande de Pavas), Puntarenas and Guanacaste.  Casa de Derechos de la Municipalidad de Desamparados was a joint effort between the UNHCR, the Municipality of Desamparados, ACAI and the University of Costa Rica. It is intended as a community support centre, where legal and psychosocial assistance is provided.  The University of Costa Rica has an agreement that allows senior students to work with ACAI, the Casa de Derechos or the Refugee department during their professional practice placements.",positive
"At the same time, UNHCR should continue to explore the potential for the local integration of refugees, many of whom have close affinities to the Tajik population.",positive
"Therefore UNHCR should renew its efforts to establish direct links with the State Committee on National Security, so as to ensure support for applications for permanent residence and eventually naturalization by refugees.",positive
Asylum seekers have access to Bulgarian territory and have their applications for refugee status examined by the competent authorities.,positive
"In principle at least, those who are recognized as refugees or granted humanitarian status have the same access to rights and services as Bulgarian citizens.",positive
"A constructive dialogue has been established between UNHCR, the government, NGOs and civil society.",positive
"In a related vein, the UNHCR and other agencies have sought to participatory solutions to various aspects of the refugee crisis, so that those being served may also have a voice in determining the policies and shaping the programs designed for their benefit.4",positive
but UNHCR was responding in a significantly more robust manner.,positive
"Refugees had continuous access to Ugandan territory, asylum and protection. UNHCR set up efficient and timely registration procedures for refugees and 90 registered 100% of refugees with level 2 registration (including biometrics) in 2014.",positive
Some challenges with capturing specific needs categories early in the response were rectified within the first few months and a targeting approach based on specific needs codes was established and utilized for sectoral interventions. The civilian character of asylum was maintained.,positive
"The Health Strategic Action Plan for the South Sudanese Refugees that guided the emergency refugee response was developed in a timely and consultative manner and based upon early and 110 continuous assessments, and had appropriate objectives. Good coverage of health services was achieved",positive
There was blanket measles immunization at entry points and a vaccination campaign in response to an outbreak in South Sudan.,positive
"ervices (targeted 140 supplementary feeding and, later, therapeutic feeding) were scaled up and blanket supplementary feeding of women and under-5s was introduced by WFP. A follow-up nutritional survey released in late 2014 showed remarkable improvement.",positive
"Sphere standards with respect to emergency water provision (litres/person/day) and ratios of toilets to people, were achieved across most settlements by June 2014. UNHCR appropriately focused on drilling and hand pump installation, motorising boreholes where yields allowed.",positive
Good coordination products and processes happened on a regular basis.,positive
"he formulation of the ReHoPE strategy focusing on self-reliance and resilience of refugees and host communities, integrated service delivery, suggest that UNHCR and partners have started to address this issue.",positive
but it was able to immediately redeploy some key staff from the other more “mature emergencies” towards the Gambella theatre of operations.,positive
The regional Child Protection Framework contributed to strengthening and structuring the child protection response. The education response (please see below) created some protection gains for refugee children between 3 and 10 years of age,positive
A pre-agreed set of operational modalities for nutrition and a well-executed strategic partnership with UNICEF afforded some preparedness.,positive
"The Gambella Regional Health Bureau (RHB), with the support of UNICEF, was instrumental in the health response for the refugees at the border points and transit centres, as was a collaborative partnership between UNHCR, MSF and ARRA 410 following an agreement signed in January 2014.",positive
"The strategic partnership with UNICEF, and ARRA’s openness to early NGO intervention opened up the humanitarian space, and played a crucial role in providing effective protection and assistance.",positive
The crude mortality rates remained well below emergency thresholds and a spike in under 5- year mortality rates in the first weeks of the response was brought down by February 2014. Outbreaks were largely prevented.,positive
"The food security situation in the three settlement districts was stable throughout 2014, but dependent on external food aid.",positive
"After a slow initial start, when poor environmental health conditions prevailed in the reception centres, the WASH sector scaled up rapidly, making use of the large number of available WASH partners.",positive
"Site identification was done relatively quickly despite challenges and a need to negotiate for community-owned land, which was in short supply, and limited involvement of the district government in Adjumani and Arua Districts.",positive
The education response by UNHCR and partners was relatively quickly set up and critical efforts were made to ensure access to national education systems and avoid setting up parallel structures.,positive
"UNHCR Uganda played a very positive, inclusive coordination role, according to the vast majority of key informants.",positive
"The unity and collaboration displayed by UNHCR and UNICEF was widely appreciated by other partners, as providing a strong boost to the response.",positive
"Based on lessons learn from prior emergencies, UNHCR facilitated timely assessments, good collaboration and timely information sharing for the nutrition sector, and ARRA welcomed nutrition interventions and support from international NGO partners.",positive
"The coordination of the health response was collaborative and effective, with no notable gaps in leadership, and effective information sharing.",positive
ut site plans were completed in good time and made good use of GIS with integration of digital elevation models to make good use of the topography and analyse flood risk.,positive
"Compared with previous emergency responses, the coordination of the emergency response was much more collaborative and inclusive.",positive
"Based on a recognition of the right of refugees to enjoy freedom of movement, to take up residence in the capital city and to enjoy a steady expansion of the protection space available to them there, UNHCR has established a concerted set of activities related to urban refugees.",positive
"At the same time, it has a established a wide range of productive new partnerships: with local government, the security services and judiciary, service providers, civil society and the NGO community.",positive
"As documented in this report, many of the approaches adopted by UNHCR in Nairobi can serve as examples of effective practice for urban refugee programmes in other countries and regions.",positive
"Even so, by means of a creative programme focused on improved communication, new partnerships and extended local networks, UNHCR has been able to expand the protection space and services available to refugees in Nairobi.",positive
Dialogue Meeting on PRS held in Geneva in December 2008 is a case in point of this cooperation.,positive
This has been accomplished in the case of TANCOSS and UNHCR played an instrumental and catalytic role in engaging the different stakeholders and mov- ing TANCOSS forward.,positive
Pillar 3 of the strategy will be implemented under these aus- pices and is included in the United Nations Development Assistance Plan. In this way it will be brought into the planning system of Government,positive
"UNHCR has worked with the Burundi Government, UNDP and other organizations to mitigate the situation.",positive
"UNHCR was instrumental in adjustments and setting up the logistics, so the process could be effectively implemented. Furthermore, UNHCR managed to play a successful role in diffusing resistance to naturalisation among local authorities and police and immigration officers, and striking a balance between mitigating xenophobia towards refugees and identifying positive spin-offs",positive
"With regard to Pillar 1, the logistics of moving a large number of families and their belongings, was accomplished in an effective manner.",positive
"While information on the revenues from disposal of vehicles before GFM is limited, the auction process used by GFM brought in revenues of approximately USD 6.3 million in 2017 alone. Regarding insurance costs, the cost of all-risk insurance bought locally is higher than insurance provided through GFM. The cost is estimated to be USD 4,635,626 for insurance bought locally, compared to USD 2,178,500 for insurance provided through GFM. This represents savings of USD 2,457,126.",positive
"GFM benefits clearly outweigh its costs, considering procurement costs, revenues from disposal, insurance costs, and the effort of staff time involved. Savings from procurement and insurance and revenues from disposal have led to an overall GFM gain of USD 17,500,000. The evaluation estimated that GFM procurement of light vehicles saved UNHCR approximately USD 8.8 million in 2017 and approximately USD 9.5 million in 2018.",positive
"Other benefits accrued through the GFM Scheme In addition to providing monetary benefits, GFM has contributed to improving and streamlining the ordering, management, and disposal of light vehicles. Self-insurance and standardization of processes are also identified as important benefits accrued through the GFM Scheme",positive
"Overall, progress since 2014 suggests the GFM global insurance is working well and that continuous improvements are being made to ensure adequate accident reporting and efficient claims and reimbursement processes.",positive
"Another important benefit of the GFM is vehicle standardization which increases efficiency and reduces costs related to management, training, maintenance and repairs because vehicles are fitted with the same components and equipment.",positive
"Initially set at 33.84 percent of the total procurement cost, the yearly rental fee decreased to 19 percent in 2018. Staff consulted in country operations consider the rental amount to be a fair. Over the five-year leasing period, rental fees cover 95 percent of the total procurement cost and, when combined with revenue generated by vehicle disposal, this total exceeds the original vehicle acquisition cost. In theory, this makes GFM self-sustaining.",positive
"In addition to monetary benefits accrued through the internal rental scheme, the centralization of the fleet management function resulted in a more simplified and standardized procurement process for light vehicles. This process appears to work well overall: in general, country operations note that the time they spend procuring vehicles has decreased in comparison with the pre-GFM period and that communication with GFM during the ordering process is clear and efficient.",positive
"Centralized disposal has had two positive, unexpected results. First, auctions are used to dispose of other items such as vehicle spare parts and office furniture and equipment. Between 2015 and 2017, revenues generated from this new practice totalled USD 3.1 million.",positive
"Second, since 2016, three UN agencies (WFP, FAO, UNON) and international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) have used GFM’s services to dispose of vehicles and other assets. Through these joint auctions, GFM generated net revenue of USD 3.4 million for its partners. Considering the strong desire of the UN System to work as one and avoid duplication among UN agencies, UNCHR’s well-defined niche in conducting public auctions may represent an unprecedented opportunity for UNCHR to become the go-to agency for the disposal of vehicles across the UN and humanitarian NGOs.",positive
"Another benefit of GFM is a decrease in the average age of UNHCR’s fleet of light vehicles. Thanks to the implementation of the disposal policy, the average fleet age decreased from 5.22 years in 2013 to 3.86 years in 2017.",positive
GFM provides valuable support to country operations and communication is generally fluid during all steps of the vehicle procurement and disposal processes.,positive
The evaluation found that drivers know they are now being monitored by the VTS and therefore have adopted safer behaviors. The VTS is also useful for emergency alerts or to monitor partner vehicles.,positive
"Overall, the evaluation concludes that the benefits of GFM clearly outweigh its costs.",positive
"UNHCR, as lead for the Global Protection Cluster, provides further basis for seeking this more direct engagement in the PoC process.",positive
PoC has the merit of providing an integrating concept for UNHCR‟s work for both refugees and IDPs.,positive
"On 14 April, UNHCR issued its own Appeal for Haiti. It has recently received a contribution (USA) of $3.8 million.",positive
"n 2009, the Protection/Human Rights/Rule of Law Cluster only accounted for 3.5 % ($388 million) of total Global Humanitarian Contributions received under appeals sponsored by OCHA. Similarly, under CERF, the same cluster only had received 1.6 % ($212 million) of grants made.",positive
"Now, the High Commissioner proposes to change that, by making a more predictable commitment by the Office to be Lead of the Protection Cluster at the country level in natural disasters.",positive
The recently introduced new budget structure with a Fourth Pillar reserved for IDP projects ensures that these positive steps are even further safeguarded.,positive
"The proposed further involvement of UNHCR in IDP situations, namely in a more predictable engagement in displacements related to natural disasters, is consistent with UNHCR‟s protection work with IDPs to date (though not formally grounded in the Convention or the Statute of the Office), and a natural progression from its role as lead of the Global Protection Cluster.",positive
"In addition to its immediate value in cushioning the impact of return, it has enabled UNHCR to monitor the return process and to identify and, where possible, respond to the needs of those returnees requiring further support, including separated and unaccompanied children and those with separated family members.",positive
"Arrangements made with the Bank of Ceylon for the payment of the grant have on the whole worked well, with mobile banking units reaching the majority of returnees within a few days of return.",positive
The presence of international NGOs in return areas would make an important contribution to addressing such gaps.,positive
"Procedures have been developed to ensure that the grant is accessible to female headed households, and arrangements have been made for unaccompanied and separated children, the disabled and others with specific needs.",positive
"his review concludes that in the past four years, UNHCR‟s efforts to address the issue of refugee protection and mixed migration in Morocco have had a number of positive consequences, creating an environment that is more conducive to the expansion of protection space for persons of concern to the Office. These include:",positive
"There is an evident need to address these difficulties, consolidating, capitalizing upon and extending the progress that has been made in recent years and ensuring that it is sustainable.",positive
"Crucially, it was designed around a framework enabling the rapid transfer from the point of initial reception to centres in other parts of Italy, within the mainstream asylum and migration system.",positive
"It is essentially an operational tool, which has proved to be effective in enhancing the protection of asylum seekers and migrants and facilitating their access to appropriate legal and administrative channels.",positive
"The findings of this evaluation have also reinforced the importance of a comprehensive approach to UNHCR‟s engagement with mixed migratory flows, and have highlighted the important synergies between UNHCR‟s operational engagement in Italy, its engagement with the European Union on asylum policy, and its operations in Libya and in countries at an earlier point in refugee journeys.",positive
"As a result of these activities, as well as the administration of a large refugee resettlement programme and the provision of extensive support to national structures that provide services to refugees, the protection space available to Iraqi refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria has expanded considerably.",positive
The impact results apply to a small number of PoC in each programme.,positive
The ET finds one of the best ways to promote protection for refugees is through livelihoods.,positive
"In Turkey, for example, there is a small yet highly capable livelihoods team; they have built a referral pathway with protection teams in order to promote lasting employment with the most vulnerable PoC. UNHCR Costa Rica adjusted their internal structure to integrate protection and durable solutions into one division with two units, allowing for better coordination and integration between the protection and livelihoods teams. The shift to a strategic livelihoods partner approach in Rwanda has been made possible through management support and a CO-wide strategy that envisions refugees as self-reliant contributors to the development of Rwanda.",positive
The ET recognizes the cash and livelihoods teams have already started working together on this issue.,positive
"UNHCR has been able to improve its household-level data collection expertise and capacity through partnership with the World Bank Joint Data Centre, and there may be additional opportunities for joint monitoring.",positive
"Many operations appreciated the structure provided by the MC, which improved the design, efficiency, and quality of activities. Market and value chain analyses, livelihoods strategic plans, guidance on livelihoods expertise required for staff, and the targeting components are considered the most helpful",positive
"NHCR’s livelihood programmes have increased partnerships with government and development actors, including other United Nations agencies. The programmes are learning and adapting from the new ways of working with private sector, financial service providers, and various government entities. In many COs, the conceptual linkages have been made that connect the mandates of protection and durable solutions with livelihoods; protection and livelihoods teams are working together to promote livelihoods for vulnerable PoC in many cases.",positive
"This is a role that should be harnessed by UNHCR as a whole, not just through its livelihoods unit, and it will strengthen its credibility with partners and donors.",positive
Savings groups provide finance and social protection in Tanzania: “Organizing saving groups has been effective in providing not only economic benefit through access to informal finance but also social protection among refugees. Vocational training and agricultural projects that include both refugees and the host communities have promoted peaceful coexistence.”,positive
"Self-reliance in agricultural livelihoods in Angola: “Despite limited funds, the Angola operation has encouraged and supported refugees with self-reliance activities…Some farmers are able to earn incomes from the sale of vegetables grown from their farms while others are engaged in trading, thus increasing incomes and nutrition at the household level.”",positive
"Advocacy enables equal access to financial services in Paraguay: “Thanks to advocacy by UNHCR, PoC with an entrepreneurial profile can now access business training courses and technical guidance by Fundación Paraguaya at no cost. Recognized refugees may also access micro-credit under the same criteria as nationals.”",positive
"Livelihood interventions are therefore being delivered in a fragile and conflict-affected setting that is fluid, unpredictable and complex. This has resulted in integrated programming to address some of the gaps.” ~South Sudan UNHCR staff",positive
PoC have diversified their livelihoods activities from proceeds earned from the livelihoods programme.,positive
The programme has worked with the national Vocational Qualifications Authority to ensure PoC have access to the certifications and employment that match their skills and experience.,positive
"Many programmes have adapted their livelihood activities to improve livelihood and protection outcomes, such as clearly linking vocational training to job markets, promoting the integration of refugee and host communities, and making adjustments to financial inclusion activities to achieve positive results.",positive
"“We look at these issues [of providing unconditional cash transfers] in a legal mindset. It takes time to see with an economic and empowering lens. We always think of protection, not marketing and empowering an individual to support themselves individually.” ~Malawi UNHCR Staff",positive
"Most UNHCR livelihood operations acknowledge the important role UNHCR has in coordination with government and development actors, including advocacy for policies at the national level.",positive
Other themes on why UNHCR should be involved in livelihoods include: UNHCR can drive policy on economic inclusion. UNHCR is positioned to be the bridge of the humanitarian- development nexus for refugee livelihoods. UNHCR should be a lead coordinator/convener around refugee livelihoods,positive
"n contexts with the ‘best’ political and economic enabling environments, UNHCR’s role is best as facilitator, linking PoC to government and private sector systems.",positive
h activities are fully consistent with the global policy framework developed by UNHCR and addressed in both the 2002 Agenda for Protection and the more recent 10-Point Plan of Action on Refugee Protection and Mixed Migration.,positive
"With few exceptions, the Branch Office has also established a firm working relationship with relevant NGOs. While UNHCR Spain cooperates effectively with relevant entities at UNHCR Headquarters",positive
"As a result of its monitoring and advocacy activities, the Branch Office has also made progress in addressing protection gaps.",positive
"It has, for example, been successful in assuring that all those who are held in detention centres receive written information regarding their right to seek asylum.",positive
"Among the major examples is the resettlement of Bhutanese refugees from Nepal, in which a multi-lateral effort with a Core Group of resettlement countries at its heart, set out over several years to change the nature of a protracted crisis by using resettlement to leverage returns to Bhutan and local integration in Nepal for those who remained.",positive
"Resettlement countries are all on board with the concept, and that is an achievement in itself.",positive
"There are few, if any, examples of SUR on which there is wide agreement that a situation started out as a case in which SUR would be applied, with specific goals, and there is agreement that those goals were achieved.",positive
SUR has been useful in bringing resettlement countries together in some situations.,positive
The international community has become more sensitized to development challenges posed by conflict and displacement; this is inter alia reflected in the Principles for Good International Engagement in Fragile States and Situations adopted in 2007.,positive
"The speed of this response, and its focus on the protection of the new arrivals, helped to prevent the crisis from becoming a humanitarian catastrophe. In this context, important contributions were also made by IOM, ICRC and the IFRC, as well as the people and institutions of the two countries concerned.",positive
UNHR subsequently distributed improved models.,positive
"As well as enabling many thousands of third country nationals to return to their homes, the evacuation programme assisted UNHCR in its efforts to secure continued access to refugees and asylum seekers in both Egypt and Tunisia.",positive
"Despite these challenging circumstances, within 72 hours of receiving requests for support from the Egyptian and Tunisian governments, UNHCR had sent appropriately skilled staff members to the field and initiated operational activities such as the pitching of 1,500 tents.",positive
"In both countries, low mortality and morbidity rates were recorded, due in large part to both the quality and quantity of assistance they received but also to the good health and nutritional status of the refugees and migrants upon arrival.",positive
Many interviewees credited the UNHCR leadership as having been instrumental to negotiate this wider humanitarian space with ARRA. UNHCR’s relationship with ARRA was complex and butted against complications of dual roles as well given that fact that ARRA was an implementing partner of UNHCR yet at the same time a governmental counterpart,positive
A hot meal was provided and efforts were made in May and June to improve the frequency and duration however it was only in early July that it became possible to extend the hot meal program for refugees for the duration of their stay in the transit centre.,positive
"Overall, the response was appropriate in terms of the package of assistance provided, with the prioritisation of providing the key lifesaving interventions.",positive
"This gap could now be usefully filled through information sharing, counseling and referrals at any stage of the procedure.",positive
"With this in mind, the evaluation finds that UNHCR ROSA has invested tremendous efforts and shown commendable commitment in trying to make a contribution towards addressing xenophobia in the country.",positive

"When High Commissioner Guterres noted in 2006 that ""Age, gender and diversity mainstreaming should really change the way we do business"", this acknowledged that the AGDM strategy implied a dramatic shift in concepts, approaches, and work methods. While some progress has been made towards this goal, in particular the reinvigoration and systematization of contact with persons of concern through Participatory Assessments (PAs),",positive
"Fifty per cent of questionnaire survey respondents felt that PAs had improved programme and protection responses to a large extent, and 32% felt that PAs have partially improved these responses. Of 170 respondents, 76% responded that PAs have led to specific targeted actions that have resulted in improvements in the protection situation for one or more groups of persons of concern",positive
"Sixty four per cent responded positively as to whether their experience of PAs had changed their own attitudes and assumptions about working with persons of concern. These positive results from the questionnaire survey were reinforced from interviews with HQ and country level staff. PAs have become the key assessment tool in UNHCR. In some environments PAs have given UNHCR staff a renewed sense of purpose, through contact with persons of concern. The importance of this should not be underestimated.",positive
Given sufficient investment it will be possible for UNHCR to keep progressing towards an organisation that can adequately mainstream AGD.,positive
AGDM was viewed as having supported capacity to take a rights and community based approach with all persons of concern.,positive
"The ACTION Plan has been a useful tool for establishing UNHCR’s organizational responsibilities, but is not a rigorous RBM document, and as such resembles plans found in many UN organizations that are transitioning to RBM.",positive
"All evaluation data sources point towards the conclusion that, given the right context, AGDM can support significant improvements in the assistance and protection situation.",positive
"Donors such as the U.S., Canada, Denmark and the UK have also placed a great deal of importance on the success of the AGDM strategy through their funding framework agreements.",positive
"Overall, the evaluation finds that the AGDM Strategy has led, in many operations, to specific targeted actions that address the heightened protection risks of specific groups, based on protection gaps identified through PA findings.",positive
The majority of respondents felt that all AGDM elements had been mainstreamed to a large extent or fully into the work of their UNHCR operations.,positive
The introduction of AGDM itself was seen by a majority of questionnaire respondents to have increased their capacity.,positive
"FPCs have performed most consistently well in their support to service delivery, in providing protection analysis and, linked to this, support to advocacy on the protection of civilians.",positive
"UNHCR has strengthened its resourcing of the cluster with more dedicated posts at field level, particularly in large, complex emergencies.",positive
The increase in UNHCR’s funding for the GPC during the period under evaluation and the associated increase in dedicated posts have considerably strengthened both the GPC’s capacity and its autonomy from UNHCR.,positive
"While UNHCR has supported the GPC in undertaking a range of advocacy initiatives in support of the centrality of protection, the support and guidance given to the drafting and publication of the IASC Policy has been the most significant achievement.",positive
his has resulted in country-level strategies and the inclusion of some specific action areas in COPs.,positive
They were considered by country offices to be relevant to national contexts and compatible with government approaches.,positive
"his was done for twelve out of thirteen piloting countries for Education, ten out of twelve for SGBV and for all seven for Child Protection.",positive
while for SGBV the inputs monitored and reported in the COP most precisely cover the activities being implemented.,positive
The process of support to adaptation was appreciated by country offices.,positive
"In relation to the inclusion of activities in COPs, the SGBV Strategy had the greatest influence, while being a SGBV Strategy pilot country increased the likelihood that Child Protection activities were incorporated in the COP.",positive
"The organization committed resources, expertise and leadership to ensure this response was successful, demonstrating what can be achieved when everyone works together.",positive
"Mortality was kept under emergency thresholds for most of the first year, and morbidity has declined significantly as has malnutrition. This was a collective effort in which UNHCR played a large role. While attribution is not precise, UNHCR has effectively managed half the camp population and responded in areas such as health, nutrition, shelter, WASH and community outreach that are correlated with those communicable diseases that have shown significant decline.",positive
"The evaluation notes that the organization rapidly increased its operations starting around 21 September 2018, airlifting supplies, opening a transit centre and eventually becoming responsible for half of the massively expanded refugee population.",positive
"It commissioned, together with IOM, a geospatial hazard mapping that made the risks and the urgency clear, convincing policymakers to act. This involved major relocations of populations at risk, and together with IOM and the World Food Programme (WFP), 3 the development of new sites, upgraded shelter and better infrastructure. The evaluation notes that only one person has died as a direct result of flooding or landslides so far, an extremely good outcome given the risks involved.",positive
"A highly experienced team was put in place in Cox’s Bazar at the beginning of the response and this continued throughout the first year of operations, despite the inevitable turnover. This led to the formulation of a well thought through and executed strategy, backed by HQ decisions that prioritized delivery and made sure that resources were available. Systems such as supply and logistics also worked well, facilitating rapid response.",positive
Two notable examples include the agreement of the Government of Bangladesh to commit to register all new births; and the advocacy within the UN community for the need of a proper assessment by a multi-agency task force and to hear the voices of the refugees before considering any potential relocation to the Bhasan Char island. The UN has used UNHCR’s expertise to ensure that this done with the welfare of the refugees in mind.,positive
"These teams are continuing to increase referrals and raise awareness on services and protection risks. Protection emergency response units also operated during the monsoon, ensuring particularly vulnerable people received care and got referrals for services like psychosocial care where available.",positive
"Notably, the March–December 2018 Joint Response Plan (JRP) demonstrates a strong emphasis on protection and a clear protection mainstreaming strategy, largely as a result of UNHCR contributions.",positive
"This can be seen both in the early involvement of the World Bank and in the statements of the High Commissioner and other senior officials, as well as in the strategic engagement of UNHCR within Myanmar, alongside UNDP, in encouraging and helping to create conditions conducive for return.",positive
"UNHCR’s thinking on solutions is also exemplified by the verification/registration exercise that was designed to support the future search for solutions based on refugees’ profile, family links, etc. as well as by the development of the Solidarity Approach for the People of Rakhine State. UNHCR has continuously reaffirmed that voluntary repatriation could be facilitated if the conditionsin Myanmar became conducive. UNHCR has insisted since the beginning of this current crisis that people have a right to return if the conditions are right, but also that this should be voluntary and on the basis of informed consent.",positive
"Recognizing early on that even if return was swift and well organized it would take time, UNHCR has invested in durable infrastructure and prioritized protection, safety and public health. This is commendable.",positive
The response of UNHCR as the UN mandated refugee agency has also been largely effective and successful in the first year.,positive
The response to the Rohingya refugee crisis saved lives and reduced suffering.,positive
The fact that such a tragedy did not occur is a testament to an effective response.,positive
UNHCR also took a leading role in the monsoon preparedness in close coordination with other agencies.,positive
UNHCR has also achieved several other protection outcomes.,positive
"Through the Protection Working Group (PWG), which it leads, UNHCR has consistently pushed for protection to be the central consideration in all aspects of the response.",positive
The evaluation notes that the protection achievements of UNHCR in the first year are encouraging and have contributed to mitigating several protection risks during a challenging period and with difficulties as noted in Section 4.3 due to the coordination structures,positive
UNHCR has had a clear focus on promoting access to durable solutions for refugees from the beginning of the Rohingya crisis.,positive
UNHCR began thinking early on about solutions.,positive
"In terms of protection, UNHCR has been able to contribute in many significant ways, especially on major advocacy fronts.",positive
"Overall, the services provided in Humenné were more comprehensive than in Timisoara. This was reflected in the level of satisfaction expressed by refugees during the focus group discussions.",positive
"The first issue was resolved in 2015 with stronger coordination taking place between the three partners: UNHCR, the US and IOM.",positive
The overwhelming majority of refugees arriving in the ETCs actually departed for resettlement. The ETCs have therefore contributed to facilitating the resettlement process of some refugees that otherwise could not have been resettled.,positive
"But they have provided a safe alternative for cases that could not be transferred directly to resettlement countries, thereby offering the only available durable solution to these refugees. For some refugees, without the ETCs, there would simply be no possibility of resettlement.",positive
"The third partner to the agreements, IOM, has taken effective care of travel logistics, medical assessments and cultural orientation training.",positive
The two ETCs have been effective to some degree considering the initial objectives established especially considering that a transfer can only be approved if a resettlement country is already identified.,positive
The main impact of the ETCs has been the provision of immediate and effective protection to refugees.,positive

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) use the AFI for high-level planning decisions and for lobbying and fundraising with donors. Although the AFI must usually be endorsed by the respective national government before it is released, government officers are less significant users. The AFI is more likely to inform government decision-making if they have an annual humanitarian response planning system in place.",neutral

Consensus building is one of the most valued yet challenging dimensions of the IPC analysis.,neutral
"The GSU has adapted its approach to quality assurance in recent years, based on experience, now giving greater emphasis to real-time technical support and less to formal quality reviews (real time or retroactive). It is trying to strike a delicate balance between playing a constructive role of technical support during the analysis process, respecting country-level ownership, and the role of guardian of the IPC as a global standard and thus ensuring, even enforcing quality standards.",neutral
Institutionalization of the IPC at country level has been a core aim of the GSP with the objective of embedding IPC processes within government institutions.,neutral
"But in the absence of a clearly articulated strategy or approach to institutionalization there is a lack of clarity within the GSP about what it means, and pragmatism prevails. Achieving the objective of national governments budgeting and paying for the whole IPC analysis is a long way off. In many countries it would not continue without external donor funding.",neutral
"his has been a large part of the GSU’s work, but as demand for capacity development grows exponentially, a more sustainable strategy for meeting this demand must be found.

"The concept of resilience speaks to a world in crisis. It starts from people’s strengths, and stresses the importance of addressing the root causes of disaster and crises rather than just their symptoms",neutral
"The resilience portfolio includes more policy work, technical advice, investment support and capacity building than in the past, with some excellent work done at regional level in Africa with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel (CILSS) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and at national level in Asia and the Middle East for the control and prevention of highly pathogenic avian influenza.",neutral
"Resilience programmes are not new to FAO. The evolution towards long-term, development- oriented crisis surveillance and response (highlighted in conclusion 2) started before SO5, under the previous Strategic Objective I1 and in some cases even earlier.

"n addition to its endemic physical and structural challenges, the agriculture sector will face dynamic challenges in the coming decade due to changes in the demographics, labour market, poverty profile and rural-urban dynamics, as well as the shrinking land area under agriculture and the impact of slow onset climate change. Public policy responses to these challenges are already considering rethinking the role of agriculture. The agricultural sector will continue to be critical in poverty reduction through the provision of livelihoods and rural employment creation, and alleviating disaster risks and climate change vulnerabilities through sustainable management of natural resources including the development of forest biodiversity. Addressing the future challenges of enhancing domestic food grain productivity, achieving food security and decreasing nutrition deficiency will continue to be important for future FAO programmes. Looking ahead, FAO should consider the dimensions that have important implications for the country’s national development agenda through new programme design and partnership modalities with the government and resource partners.",neutral
"The SDGs set new development milestones for 2030, which will require additional investments in developing countries. At the same time, the attainment of middle-income country status will affect the level of overseas development assistance to future programmes (which are balanced by a compensatory adjustment of domestic resources or concessional borrowings to fund nationally owned mainstream programmes). This will alter the modality of technical cooperation. Considering these points, FAO needs to rethink its niche and explore new partnership modalities in the new environment.",neutral
"With the government increasingly moving to national execution modalities and a larger proportion of self-financing for development priorities, the profile of technical assistance and capacity development needs will change.

"FAO has a number of unique strengths with which to address CCAM. At the same time, important shifts in the organization’s way of working are required to optimize FAO’s approach to CCAM and its impact on food security and the agriculture sector.",neutral
"However, the evaluation also found several areas that could be improved to increase the effectiveness of FAO’s own CCAM efforts, as well as its ability to assist and influence member countries and other international stakeholders. The findings on the most salient strengths and weaknesses are summarized below.",neutral
"FAO Representation engagement at country level Finding 2: It is through engaging with Government at country level that FAO can bring the greatest contributions on CCAM. However, the engagement of FAO Representations with governments and development partners on climate change as it relates to the agricultural sectors and food security has overall been modest due to capacity limitations on climate issues in FAO Country Offices.",neutral
"Many other development organizations, including those with far greater resources than FAO, have engaged directly with governments in country on climate change and the agricultural sectors much more so than FAO has, and member countries continue to develop their own capacities in these fields.",neutral
"The international engagement of FAO in the UNFCCC and the GACSA Finding 3: In the UNFCCC, FAO has brought greater attention to the role of the agricultural sectors in CCAM through the knowledge it has provided at the sessions. Negotiators, however, have not benefited as much from their brief interactions with FAO as they would from in-depth information events outside the meetings. In the Global Alliance for Climate-smart Agriculture and the UNFCCC, there have been misunderstandings among some members about FAO’s motivations behind promoting mitigation under the CSA approach and this could affect the agency’s image as a neutral technical body if left unaddressed.",neutral
"Normative work and analysis and strengthening member country data and knowledge Finding 4: The analytical support, tools and data provided to member countries by FAO have been of substantial quality and have strengthened national knowledge and data systems for CCAM. While FAO has a clear comparative advantage in this area, it has not sufficiently sought to develop the capacity of member countries in CCAM analysis and knowledge generation.",neutral
"Assistance for developing country enabling environments, including through coordinating stakeholder institutions Finding 5: One of FAO’s greatest comparative advantages lies in its expertise-based alignment of the strategies of different ministries and departments involved in CCAM and DRR in agriculture. The agency’s work in this area has brought about notable advances in the enabling environment at country level.",neutral
"While developing policies for CCAM should remain an important goal for FAO, its highest valued added lies in aligning and harmonizing the climate change and DRR strategies, policies and systems of government agencies and other partners. This is due in part to the changing global landscape on knowledge and governance on CCAM, as well as FAO’s neutrality which is valued by both member countries and development institutions. There is much need for such work at the national level in member countries and at the sub-national one (where under decentralized political systems CCAM strategies are to be developed and capacities to address the issue improved) which FAO has an opportunity to address in the future, particularly in the SIDS.",neutral
"Technical assistance and field-level interventions Finding 6: FAO’s community-level projects produced some solid contributions to CCAM and climaterelated DRR for small producers. However, overall these interventions do not reflect the agency’s comparative advantage.",neutral
"Climate-smart agriculture Finding 8: Climate-smart Agriculture has served FAO well as a high-level concept framing its work on CCAM, considering the agency’s diverse portfolio on adaptation and mitigation across the different agricultural sectors, and the clear priority that member countries place on adaptation over mitigation. At the field level, only a small set of FAO’s projects have reflected a pursuit of the Climate-smart Agriculture approach and they have done so somewhat imperfectly.",neutral
"here are also opportunities and challenges for CCAM in food systems that FAO could better address. Given their importance for producers and consumers, vulnerability to climate change and sizeable contributions to GHG emissions, there is significant scope for FAO to increase its focus on value chains and food systems rather than merely food production, if it wishes to be more effective in pursuing adaptation, mitigation, and food security.",neutral
"Mainstreaming long-term climate change adaptation into DRR and emergency programmes Finding 10: Longer-term climate change adaptation measures have been mainstreamed into FAO’s emergency response and climate-related DRR interventions to a partial degree, and the agency’s countrylevel UN cluster coordination on DRR has also promoted adaptation. A key challenge in this regard has been the lack of conceptual clarity and guidance on the differences among emergency, DRR and long-term adaptation interventions.",neutral
"The agency will need to achieve a greater understanding and consensus on climate change adaptation if it is to be more effective in supporting it. Distinguishing among interventions in terms of how much they contribute to resilience versus climate adaptation would be difficult if not unproductive, but field projects need some guidance of how the interventions are different and what the best practices are to develop effective climate adaptation interventions in specific contexts.",neutral
"Addressing gender inequalities in FAO’s climate change work Finding 11: A substantial gap in mainstreaming gender in FAO’s climate change work exists though women as project recipients have benefited in a small number of CCAM projects. FAO recognizes that globally climate change will have greater impacts on women, but this was not reflected in the agency’s operations in this area.",neutral
"Partnerships for CCAM Finding 12: FAO pursued relatively few strategic partnerships with NGOs, other knowledge organizations and the private sector for CCAM to, respectively, disseminate best practices, draw on advanced expertise and data, and influence global food systems. While its partnership with other UN entities has brought some important achievements, FAO’s relationship with development investment institutions has enabled its expertise to have a much wider impact.",neutral
Such collaboration would be useful in helping FAO beneficiaries overcome the barriers to adopting climate adaptation practices.,neutral
"Given the threat of climate change to agriculture and food security, a minimum degree of CCAM mainstreaming in FAO’s portfolio would seem to be required. Mainstreaming climate change will also help to incorporate basic design and implementation best practices into projects and programmes.",neutral
"However, CCAM can require additional measures. Sustainability is then necessary but not sufficient for adaptation",neutral
"Overall, FAO’s resources for addressing climate change – USD 440.7 million from 2009 to 2014 – were markedly smaller compared to the CCAM budgets of some other development institutions",neutral

Findings ES6 The evaluation was guided by the following evaluation questions: Evaluation question 1: How relevant was the primary focus and programme logic of FSNAU in terms of its stated four principals/priorities to Somalia’s institutional and policy framework on food security? To what extent did the design of the communication strategy in FSNAU support these four principals?,neutral
Evaluation question 2: To what extent did FSNAU succeed in linking to other technical partners at the national level?,neutral
"Evaluation question 3: To what extent have synergies been created among FSNAU, SWALIM and other partners working on food security information systems, such as FEWS NET?",neutral
"Evaluation question 4: To what extent have gender and other equity issues, including human rights, been taken into account in the design of FSNAU and during implementation?",neutral
"In the long-term, however, a portion of FSNAU management should be moved to Somalia.",neutral
"Evaluation question 6: To what extent has the food security and nutrition information and analysis produced by FSNAU been used by decision-makers (e.g. government, United Nations agencies and Clusters, NGOs and donors) and for what purposes? What are the prospects of sustaining FSNAU results after its completion?",neutral
"Despite the extensive usage of FSNAU’s data and information products, more needs to be done to ensure increased utilisation of the products. This could include, for example, more timely products, translation of key summaries into Somali, and improved programming guidelines for the Food Security Outlooks.",neutral
"Based on the information collected from stakeholders, the evaluation team feels that it is not realistic for the Somali government to take over the data analysis and database management, due to limited technical and institutional capacity. There is, however, a need for further capacity development to gradually increase government involvement (e.g. in the data analysis), and to gradually transfer other parts of the project operation to Somalia, even if this will remain under remote management from Nairobi.",neutral
"It is critical to continue strengthening the capacity development measures in the upcoming phase, in order to create Somali ownership of the process. For the next phase, the focus should be on higher level of involvement and capacitation of the Somali government in the data analysis process (for instance through the IPC)",neutral

"The three levels of capacity development (capacity development of individuals, organizations and in the enabling environment) were identified as central to the development process. Capacity development of individuals entails training and equipping the individuals with skills in specific areas through formal and informal means. Organizational capacity development implies the strengthening of knowledge and skills, beyond the individual, through a system approach. Capacity development in the enabling environment involves strengthening the broader development context for improved management of change. Although the project was not evaluated against the FAO CD framework, the findings are categorized within each level for the benefit of analysis and narrative.",neutral

"ucceeding the EVD crisis, the project started to reorganize the district coordination mechanisms. The planning for the new coordination mechanisms started in November- December 2015; in February 2016 the planning sessions with the District Councils took place. Four new districts were included: Bo, Kailahun, Koinadugu and Pujehun. Learning from the four pilot districts, the project changed the strategy of supporting the coordination mechanisms to ensure a higher level of government ownership. For all districts, including the first four districts, the coordination mechanism is now directly under the District Council. It is expected that there will still be a need for support from local partners after the phase out of the project; and in July 2016 LoAs with Implementing partners (IPs) were signed for the implementation of the District FNS Coordination Mechanism in the eight districts. As a new intervention as compared to the four pilot districts, the coordination also includes Early Warning and Disaster Management. The support to the eight districts is",neutral

"he collaboration with Njala University, which is the main national agricultural university, started in 2013 after a two weeks training of key stakeholders on the concepts of FNS and RtF. Succeeding the training, the university authorities requested the project for technical and financial support to the development and implementation of an introductory BSc course on FNS and RtF for all first year students in the School of Agriculture and related departments. After some initial steps taken by the University, it was realized that there was a need to facilitate the further process (preparation of the curriculum and training of the teachers), and the project hence contracted an international consultant. The consultant finalized the FNS and RtF Module including power point presentations and course outline in 2015.",neutral
The full time teaching is planned to start in October 2016. The estimated number of students will be around 200-500 students for each teaching session according to information from the interviewed lecturers.

"In-service training in FNS and RtF of extension workers started under the project in 2013. The project team prepared a module (Module 10) on food and nutrition security to be included in the Farmer Field School (FFS) Manual prepared by the MAFFS, SCP and Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP).",neutral
From the beginning of 2016 there was a change in the training strategy as it was decided that GAFSP should include the training in Module 10 in the general FFS Manual training.,neutral
The change of the training strategy also involved a decrease from the 12 districts targeted by the project to the 8 districts where FFS is currently operational. Extension workers from the other four districts will also be included in the GAFSP training,neutral
EQ 4: “To what extent have the projects contributed to mainstream nutrition into agricultural national policies?”,neutral
"In accordance with the third dimension of the Corporate Policy on Capacity Development, project support was provided to policy formulation.

In terms of nutrition, lactating and pregnant women are the most vulnerable (and discriminated groups), especially children. However, there are also other groups with special nutritional needs, e.g. HIV infected and AIDS affected",neutral
"In addition to the five above-mentioned Evaluation Questions, the evaluation was requested to examine the linkages between the project and the corporate RtF work based on the following question: To what extent has the project liaised with other Right to Food projects or FAOs RtF work in general?",neutral
"n order to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable national development in this regard it is crucial that gender is explicitly addressed within the various not yet finalized nutritional interventions and outputs (roll-out of the FFS Module 10, etc.). In a longer term perspective it is imperative that the special needs of other vulnerable groups (e.g. HIV/AIDS affected and infected) is included in the broader campaigning.",neutral
"t is imperative to keep up this momentum and sustain the continued delivery of the results. Considerable support and follow-up is required. It was indicated during the evaluation mission that some (limited funds) might be available for continuing parts of the outputs. As mentioned earlier, a budget revision was submitted to the donor in March 2016 due to the underutilization of funds in 2015. The project requested to transfer these funds to 2016. At the time of report writing, the project had not received any response from the donor. Other opportunities for additional funding mentioned include: funds to continue the employment of the project nutritionist in MAFFS for one more year (IFAD funds) TCP funds to support nutrition; furthermore the nutrition advisor currently placed in MAFFS might be able to continue one year on the GAFSP (supporting the FFSs) It is important that these opportunities are properly investigated in order to secure the continued support to the results of the project. As previously stated, the EU and FAO will jointly finance a nutritionist in the Strategic Advisory Board; this is very important and will secure support to nutrition at a strategic level.",neutral
"In order to be able to continue and sustain the work on FNS and RtF at FAO Country Office level, it is pivotal that these areas are also reflected and included in the upcoming CPF (2016-2019).

"The revised CPF sets out a clear strategic direction for FAOSS to 2017 and has been developed collaboratively with government. It reflects learning since December 2013, for example that FAO’s development work needs to be more ‘risk sensitive’. The CPF could be strengthened with greater attention to preparedness, building flexibility into programming appropriate to the volatile context of South Sudan, and ensuring emergency programming is more informed by the resilience paradigm. FAOSS’s strategy in the livestock sector focuses on improving animal health, and could usefully make stronger links to achieving sustainable increases in livestock production through other mechanisms. The ELRP has become the de facto strategy document guiding much of FAOSS’s work since December 2013.

"FAO distributed its fisheries kits as an emergency intervention, and must now engage with the ‘precautionary approach’ to fisheries management, mandated by the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF), and echoed by the draft fisheries policy for South Sudan. The fishery in South Sudan is open access, with no controls on numbers of fishers or entry. It would therefore be prudent to calculate the overall annual catch from the emergency kits, in view of the paucity of data on fishery resources in the country.",neutral

This is an opportunity to learn from their practices and organisational culture that has fostered this, as well as from other L3 responses where AAP has been better integrated, such as the Typhoon Haiyan response in the Philippines.",neutral
"FAO has the foundations of a more resilience-oriented programme, for example the FFS and seed multiplication instead of importing large quantities of seed. It is still at an early stage of working this through to programme design and implementation, which will require rethinking its approach to the provision of animal health services to consider cost- recovery in all but the worst conflict-affected states. Resilience thinking is more evident in the 2016 ELRP. Senior managers in FAOSS have come together to draft a resilience strategy since the fieldwork for this evaluation was completed",neutral

"This is fundamentally a contractual relationship of service provision rather than a genuine partnership. FAOSS should now identify which of its IPs it wants to develop a more strategic partnership with, to reflect a more equal relationship, drawing on the knowledge and comparative advantage of each organization.",neutral
"Two years into the conflict is a good time to take stock. It is also time to inject a more analytical and differentiated approach to programming that is better nuanced to the particular context of different states and different livelihood groups. The evaluation encourages greater differentiation between the most conflict-affected states and the less conflict-affected states where more developmental approaches can be applied. The recently completed conflict and livestock study is an example of how more in-depth research and analysis can either confirm or challenge programming assumptions, ultimately resulting in more effective livelihoods work, at both programme and policy levels. Strategic investment in impact assessment of interventions that have been at the heart of FAOSS’s work will further contribute to effective programming, and will reinforce and inform FAOSS’s strategic leadership role in the agricultural sector.",neutral

"The prevention and management of transboundary animal and plant pests and diseases and food safety threats has been, remains and will continue to be highly relevant to the livelihoods and food security of farmers and traders everywhere. Furthermore, the prevention, detection and control of food safety threats are highly relevant, and increasingly so, not only to food producers and traders, but to the society as a whole, in particular the consumers",neutral
here is considerable evidence that through the EMPRES approach FAO has played and must continue to play a key role at multiple levels in addressing TPDs and FSTs.,neutral
"EMPRES has been FAO’s flagship response to TPDs since 1994. The original EMPRES pillars of Early Warning, Early Reaction, Enabling Research and Coordination remain relevant. The pillars, though refined over the years, are now encompassed in the four outcome areas of SO5, and are designed to build resilience to food chain crises caused by TPDs and FSTs",neutral
Results were found at all levels and are described from global to regional to national level. The evaluation notes that many of the results identified (in food safety and support to standard setting and regulatory frameworks) fall under the remit of Strategic Objective 4.,neutral
"e latter is designed to consolidate forecasting information while providing comprehensive risk analyses. Concurrently, the SO5 evaluation highlighted the need for stronger integration of FAO’s early warning tools, both internally and with the ones operated by external partners. This evaluation confirmed the need for improved integration.",neutral
"Considering the current capacity limitations, however, continued vigilance is needed to ensure that optimal capacity and appropriate systems are maintained within FAO. The evaluation acknowledges that these types of crises have a high and very diverse degree of specificities, requiring significant technical knowledge and a case-by-case response. At the",neutral
"same time, coordination and operational capacity at all levels (from global to community) are also key elements, and FAO needs to support member countries to respond to these types of crises.

"In practice, at any given time, most technical work has been on one aspect or another of social protection, not on broad integrative approaches.",neutral
"Cases studies also provided concrete examples (e.g., Ghana and Nepal) of where the ILO was providing both traditional, actuarial advice as well as advising on extending social protection through universal approaches. In Jordan, where concrete impacts were mostly in the vertical dimension (maternity), the ILO nonetheless advised on extending social protection to the informal sector.",neutral
"As interest grows in the social protection floor, and integrated approaches to generate employment while extending social protection, the pressure to mobilise resources will also intensify.",neutral

"The Governing Body and the Director-General have emphasized the need for a renewed emphasis on the Office’s activities in migration: it is recognized as a critical pillar to decent work, job growth, and development in general. The ILO views migration as a labour market and decent work issue within the overarching framework of the Decent Work agenda. Labour migration can alleviate labour market pressures and make a significant contribution to the economic development of source countries through the considerable foreign exchange flows and acquired skills. The World Bank’s newly released data indicate that remittance flows to developing countries reached $251 billion in 2007 - an 11 percent growth compared to 2006, and an",neutral

"Skills development is an important part of the ILO’s work. It raises the value and output of labour, empowers workers and enriches their lives and improves the productivity, sustainability and compet- itiveness of enterprises.

Skills development is a fundamental enabler of decent work.",neutral
"The considerable scope and complexity of the ILO’s work in skills make any broad judgement of performance in this area very difficult. For example, work in national training system reform is hard to compare with projects that build skills to improve livelihoods in rural communities.

"The Programme coordinates research, promotional activities and the provision of policy advice and technical assistance to support ILO constituents in their endeavours to improve the quantity and quality of jobs for young people. As far as possible, YEP also supports implementation of the youth employment priorities specified in over half of the current 67 Decent Work Country Programmes (DWCPs) (see figure 1), and facilitates learning and knowledge-sharing for 43 technical cooperation projects implemented since 2005 totalling US$88,734,443 in allocated funds excluding MDG allocations of $10.5 million (see table 1 and figure 2). The Programme has one coordinator who is supported by two Geneva-based project staff and a technical specialist identified from each of the three departments in the Employment Sector, as well as extra-budgetary funded staff in three regions. In Africa, some $3 million in regular budget supplementary account (RBSA) resources were programmed in late 2008 to support youth employment initiatives in the region.",neutral
"Findings of the ILO youth employment strategy evaluation For this evaluation, seven evaluation criteria were adopted, namely: (i) relevance, responsiveness and ILO added value; (ii) coherence and complementarity; (iii) effectiveness; (iv) efficiency; (v) internal coordination and management; (vi) impact; (vii) sustainability. The main findings related to the above criteria are described below. 1. Relevance, responsiveness and ILO added value",neutral
"The intertwining of youth development policies, employment and other social policies is a priority when addressing youth employment at national level.",neutral
"ILO calls for mutually reinforcing action to promote gender equality in staffing, substance and structure in the policy.",neutral
"what the implementation of ILO initiatives matters. In this regard, evaluation is really important to demonstrate results.",neutral
he formulation of gender equality and non-discrimination markers for the 2016-17 P&B is important and requires in-house collaboration as well as a review of good practices from other UN agencies.,neutral
An Action Plan is necessary as it reminds and convinces ILO staff that gender equality is an inherent value of ILO and should remain high up on all agendas.,neutral
"ILO probably requires an updated vision on gender equality, outlining where the ILO is going with gender equality and what is expected and why.",neutral
ore sharing of relevant information on innovative initiatives and new publications/tools is a cost efficient measure that could be improved via the ILO electronic gateway particularly through the gateway policy section.,neutral
The next Action Plan should be deeply ingrained in and linked to the ten P&B outcomes.,neutral
"The Organization could play a much more important role in the humanitarian response, given its specificity and uniqueness in compa- rison with other UN agencies.",neutral
"These interventions target key actors at every level, ranging from high-level decision-makers at national and international levels (i.e. legislators, policy-makers, national tripartite structures) to key labour market intermediaries (i.e. trade unions, employers’ organizations, labour inspectorates) to beneficiaries and target groups at local level (i.e. workers, employers, training organizations). For high-level decision-makers, the principal interventions in the field of labour protection include high- level policy-oriented advice and the establishment of appropriate national-level social dialogue mechanisms relating to negotiations on the ratification of Conventions and Recommendations, and to the introduction of new legislation. At the intermediate level, ILO interventions include the provision of expert analysis and reports, the collation of evidence in databases, the delivery of training and the development of guidance materials. At local level, ILO direct interventions include information and awareness-raising activities, and training and technical advice. Key factors influencing trends in ILO interventions in the field of labour protection in the period under review include the Great Recession, increased migration, and the accelerating pace of globalization and technological change. Interventions in the field of labour protection have clear links to interventions in other fields, and often benefit from synergies with other organizations, projects and topics.",neutral

The world of work is changing and young people are likely to be at the forefront of these changes. How the ILO responds to the emergence of new forms of work – and the opportunities and risks they present to young people – will require some difficult strategic choices,neutral
Findings A. Relevance,neutral
Fragmentation of effort in youth employment development needs to be minimized.,neutral
"The ILO itself needs to be careful not to reinforce piecemeal approaches, mainly by focusing on the use of single tools instead of promoting holistic solutions.",neutral
"such as the Youth Employment in North Africa activities, a partnership intended to develop a regional and systematic approach to youth employment.",neutral
"Apprenticeships are attracting global interest as a means of enhancing youth employability and meeting employers’ skills needs. The ILO has supported institutional capacity to deliver “Quality Apprenticeships” in a number of countries, and has supported the Global Apprenticeship Network (GAN), a business-driven initiative, in its promotional efforts. Apprenticeships have proven their effectiveness in some countries, but local context needs to be considered. Policy intent is also a consideration. Many quality apprenticeship systems are founded on their ability to provide employers with highly skilled workers. While they can fa- cilitate school-to-work transition for many young people, they are not a panacea for youth unemployment.",neutral

"eparations are underway for ILO participation in the next UN High Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, to be held in New York on 3-4 October 2013, and an ILO Tripartite Technical Meeting on Labour Migration, scheduled for 4-8 November 2013, will provide the opportunity for discussing follow-up to this Dialogue.",neutral
The ILO takes the Chair at a moment of reform of the GMG and in the midst of worldwide discussions regarding the post 2015 development agenda.,neutral
"A number of good practices related to capacity building, viii knowledge, and the development of the competences of social partners and labour ministries, have also been highlighted in evaluation reports.",neutral
"Thus, intervention design and scope are crucial. The best project management does not compensate for poor design.",neutral
"Social dialogue interventions can also be influenced, both positively and negatively, by a number of external factors.",neutral
"A dilemma emerged regarding whether to focus on developing social dialogue per se, or by trying to simultaneously develop social dialogue along with other objectives, such as health and safety, combating HIV/AIDS, and dealing with gender issues, immigration and human trafficking.",neutral
The designs of SF interventions differ with the scope.,neutral
The inclusion of social finance into DWCP designs naturally differs according to the national contexts.,neutral
"The effectiveness of social finance interventions should be seen as the extent to which they together contribute to the achievement of the 2005 GB mandate: more employment, less vulnerability, and stronger constituents. The interventions fall in three categories: capacity building of constituents and other partners; mainstreaming social finance in the ILO; and activities originating directly from the SFP as the Focal Point, especially the MF4DW and MIIF.",neutral
They are often better placed to generate capacity than the ILO itself as the implementer of training.,neutral
"The momentum resulting from the financial and microfinance crises points to two complementary approaches, one upstream and one downstream. Upstream is the need for governments to provide better protection for their citizens vis-à-vis the financial sector, be it large, medium or micro-scale. ILO has a role to play in this as the advocate for the working poor. Downstream, the losses faced by many workers and employers were related to their limited knowledge of the financial contracts they entered into",neutral
"Key conclusions and recommendations The results from this study provide an additional lens through which to view the ILO‟s operational performance during the 2009-10 period. Notably, this insight is limited to the area of technical cooperation and has a time lag of several years. The approach can only partially align with the current P&B strategies during a given biennium. Nonetheless, independent project evaluation findings provide useful insights into where and how the ILO has performed, and also help to answer the critical question of why. If repeated, the methodology could support systematic reporting of such performance results each biennium.",neutral
The introduction of a country programme approach is of relatively recent origin.,neutral
"For most countries, the adjustment process initially involved reformulating a set of individual interventions, often funded individually by different donors, into a more focused programme based on agreed Decent Work outcomes. For those countries that had already been using a country programme approach before it was formally required, such as the Philippines, or were starting from a clean slate, as in Argentina, the adoption of a country programme approach was somewhat conceptually smoother",neutral
"his is evident in case studies Philippines, Argentina Tanzania1 that cover evaluations for the whole of the 2006 to 2010 assessment period.",neutral
"At the time the DWCP evaluations took place, this transition process was still underway.",neutral
It is also required at the public sector level amongst those agencies whose mandate is to oversee Decent Work issues.,neutral
Such findings have some general implications for future programming.,neutral
"Major disruptions occurred in the economies of countries evaluated during the 2001-2010 decade in which the nine DWCPs were evaluated. In particular, Argentina faced an economic crisis; Indonesia faced a major earthquake and tsunami; and Honduras faced intensive political upheaval. All countries were affected by the financial crisis occurring in the later part of the decade. These disruptions had implications for the evaluative processes, both the logical framework/results framework and related M&E frameworks",neutral
"When countries encounter disruptions, even if sound logical framework/results frameworks help generate desirable performance information, they cannot be static given the changing environment. This implies that the logical framework/results frameworks must be dynamic as well as sound. When addressing Decent Work challenges, they should be periodically reviewed to ensure they adequately reflect the needs and priorities of the countries concerned. In order to capture the consequences of this dynamism and disruption, more regular assessment mechanisms are needed to complement the ex-post evaluation effort. ILO began conducting Country Program Reviews (CPR) in 2008. In the light of this report's findings, it is recommended that increased attention be given to CPRs with a view ensuring relevant lessons learnt from this meta-analysis are taken on board - such as constituent engagement, changes to relevance and coherence, efficiency, effectiveness and potential sustainability.",neutral
"The challenges faced in some countries, such as Honduras, present considerable risks in the achievement of DWCP objectives. The Honduras DWCP evaluation called for a risk mitigation strategy to be included in the DWCP, particularly in relation to political and economic risks.",neutral

"owever this evaluation notes (as did the mid-term and evaluability assessment) that projects which have an ambitious task (changing attitudes and mind frames towards MDW, not to mention examining laws and working with so many actors), require longer time frames. Attribution is difficult to measure, and in many cases, incremental changes can only be noted in the policy sphere.",neutral
"Most interviewees made the point that with more human resources and better coordination with national strategies from the start, pilot initiatives would have made better progress and be more sustainable.",neutral
The need for a focus on MDWs themselves has been fully recognised as the most sustainable approach for collective action to build advocacy approaches. Organising domestic workers is no easy task and requires further support.,neutral
"Almost without exception, political leaders and government officials in countries visited during the evaluation cite the challenges of youth employment as one of, if not the most, pressing challenge.",neutral
"These totals do not reflect the use of the W4Y products (and underlying data) by The MasterCard Foundation for advocacy, decision making, programme development and in its work with partners.",neutral
"The project curates the cleaned SWTS micro data from all of the country surveys as they are completed. Access to these data sources is provided upon request and is accompanied by the instruments. Two research symposia were organized to encourage use of SWTS data in research. A scan of the major academic/professional bibliographic databases for additional publications (2012- 2016) yields a number of publications using the search term, “school to work transition survey”",neutral
"The initial project design was ambitious, with 56 surveys in 28 countries to be implemented, analysed, and disseminated within the five-year period (later modified to 53 surveys in 34 countries). In eight countries an employer survey accompanied the first round of SWTS.",neutral
"In contrast, strategic investment would have the potential to increase the value (impact) of the resources already produced through the W4Y project.",neutral
"When assessing impact at the country level, it cannot be overemphasized that the evaluation team is drawing on the experiences of six (out of 34) countries. As is the case for global impact, much of the potential country level impact of W4Y in terms of supporting improved policy and programme responses is yet unrealized.",neutral
"Extracting more value (impact) from the W4Y investment at the country level would require more – and strategic – investment in countries where the potential to use SWTS information to inform policy and programme responses was greatest. These investments would focus on deepening and contextualizing the analysis of SWTS – possibly combined with other information gathering exercises – and using collaborative analysis as a means of building stronger partnerships among the key stakeholders. Criteria for identifying the countries where the potential for impact would be greater would include: how recent was the latest survey completed, the existence of a relevant policy process to support and analytical capacity (or opportunity to develop capacity) of key stakeholders. These complementary investments would improve the value for money of W4Y.",neutral
"far, 26 African countries, in the Americas and the Caribbean in 14 countries, for Asia and Pacific in 11 and in five European/Central Asian countries have done so.",neutral
"The extent to which this is possible is, however, influenced by the limited amount of financial and other resources allocated by the different stakeholders. National policies thus need to be linked to concrete planning on implementation and strategies for resource allocation.",neutral
"While ILO/AIDS has been the source from which most of the ILO work on HIV in the world of work emanated, other ILO sectors also implemented actions and contributed to HIV policy development. The ILO work on migration, child labour and the informal economy has already integrated issues on non-discrimination, support for orphans and economic empowerment, for example. There is still a need to ensure that HIV in the world of work is more thoroughly embedded in social and employment protection, with special emphasis on occupational safety and health",neutral
This situation is likely to improve given that the UN joint strategy now explicitly calls for institutionalizing HIV support within existing programmes and systems.,neutral
"The evaluators have concerns that the overall situation for funding world of work and HIV strategies is uncertain. Donors are increasingly funding at country level, and to some extent through joint UN strategies. The UN approach to HIV is also likely to be affected by changes in donor resource allocations while the ILO‗s place within this changing system is uncertain. Due to resource constraints and the disparate needs of countries, the ILO can prioritise its focus on countries meeting criteria such as high HIV prevalence, high overall numbers of people affected by HIV, availability and commitment of local resources to addressing HIV through the world of work. Evidence suggests that this is already somewhat the case though coverage remains broad.",neutral

The challenge of sustainability is for capacity development to be built into programmes/projects, so that constituents are sufficiently engaged in order to enable their own capacity to be strengthened as part of a broader strategy of organizational development.",neutral
High-level evaluations include ratings for each of the evaluation criteria. These are not global ratings of the ILO’s capacity development work. Their purpose is to highlight areas where the evaluations located strengths and weaknesses.,neutral
There are challenges in integrating capacity development priorities into broader priorities and into much of the DC that donors wish to fund.,neutral
"The evaluation identified areas of lessons learned, such as: the need for comprehensive and coherent support, and the continuous presence of the ILO; the need to assess and analyse capacity needs and con- straints in the wider context, for example, both the overall political, economic, and social environment and organizational context of the constituents; capacity development as both a means and an end to the ILO’s results; the specific approaches required for measuring and evaluating capacity development; and the importance of accounting for linkages and partnerships so as to position the particular ILO effort in ways that demonstrate attribution.",neutral
"While the evaluation attempts to bring forth lessons and recommendations with regards to DW mainstreaming, it is imperative to stress that the ILO’s efforts towards policy coherence, especially at national level cannot solely be assessed under Outcome 19. The evaluation report also reflects advancements made by the Office in the countries under review, to the overall agenda of policy coherence under different outcomes in: developing comprehensive and inclusive Decent Work Country Programmes (DWCPs); expanding relationships with UN partners; building constituents’ capacity to contribute to policy and programme frameworks, including to the United Nations",neutral

"On the second area, the report notes the increasing interest in diasporas considered as agents of development through remittances and investments in countries of origin. An effective implementation of programmes in that area also requires an appropriate assessment of the diasporas, of their capacity to invest, and of the investment climate and opportunities in the country of origin.",neutral

"Concerning labour migration, the report suggests a continuing focus on the management of organized labour migration and to include a development component in activities when relevant, as is the case with the labour migration projects being implemented between Guatemala and Canada. But labour migration does not systematically require a strong link with development prospects; as the recently adopted strategy document says: The primary goal of IOM is to facilitate the orderly and humane management of international migration.",neutral
The fourth area includes capacity building projects and researches where IOM has gained a recognized expertise.

"For this reason, this Evaluation has explored the potential for Transition Management as an approach to help achieve these changes, since its concept and application have a strong focus on sustainability topics. This choice does not intend to exlude any other innovation approaches that can be relevant for the Sub-Programme.",neutral
"Transition Management advocates a disruptive strategy for change in which a new concept destabilizes the existing socio-technical regime, followed by an ‘evolutionary stabilization’ and impact strategy. This fits in the UN Environment Business Model in the sense that UN Environment catalyses effort at the beginning of a proverbial ‘steep learning curve’ and stewards the work until a ‘take-off’ stage is reached, at which point further implementation is handed over to partners who have previously been engaged in ‘walking-the-walk’. These aspirational business models involving more disruptive innovation are likely to be met by resistance since they will also intend, in part, to disrupt business-as-usual strategies by governments and corporations. Therefore, they can also be taken up by other stakeholders with conceptual and scientific support from UN Environment. A Transition Management approach provides useful insights for the evaluation of the Resource Efficiency Sub-Programme",neutral

"With respect to the key questions posed in the Terms of Reference for this evaluation, the following broad conclusions have been synthesized from the detailed analysis and findings presented in the evaluation report.",neutral
UNEP monitoring and reporting to CPR should be revised to focus on progress towards the delivery of PoW Outputs and Expected Accomplishments. This would require monitoring of objectively verifiable milestones that track progress ‘along’ causal pathways to PoW Outputs and Expected Accomplishments.,neutral
"If collections of project concepts were presented in an EA Framework this collaborative planning benefit could be retained, and the frameworks could be used as a design tool to strengthen the causal logic, and plan for greater synergy, among collections of projects in relation to the achievement of Expected Accomplishments. The casual logic, upon which the PoW should be built, should be examined early in the MTS and PoW preparation process before higher results levels are formalized (and thereby fixed) in the broader UN work planning approvals process.",neutral
"The PoW planning documents specify a range of roles and responsibilities for Divisions in subprogramme implementation. These responsibilities were defined in terms such as; Lead Division, Coordinating Division, Programme Framework Coordinating Division, PoW Output Managing Division and Project Level Managing Division. From a design perspective this seems overly complex.",neutral

"During the biennium 2008/09, UNEP’s climate change initiatives were dispersed across different divisions/sub- programmes. From 2010 onwards the biennial UNEP Programmes of Work (POWs) were arranged along thematic sub- progammes, including one for Climate Change, that cut across divisions. Sub-programme objectives were based on, inter alia, a prioritization of global, regional and national needs identified through various processes while taking into account UNEP’s comparative advantage and menu of services",neutral
"Generally, the “how” of UNEP’s objectives is defined at the project level; i.e. the project is the modality for how activities and outputs will contribute to high-level objectives. Projects are delivered through a variety of products and services, in the form of technical assistance, policy advice, workshops/trainings, papers/reports, assessments, scientific research, etc. UNEP’s work is largely normative and focuses on supporting the uptake of scientific information and best practices in policies, strategies and their implementation. Interventions of a more operational nature are usually limited to developing, testing and demonstrating tools and approaches in a restricted geographical area, that are expected to be scaled up at the national level through much larger, national programmes often supported by other development agencies.",neutral

"Each POW Output (for both 2010/11 and 2012/13) has been assigned to one Division accountable for its delivery. Only for the Mitigation component have all POW Outputs been assigned to a single Division – DTIE – while the outputs under EA(a), EA(d) and EA(e) are dispersed among the 5 other UNEP divisions. This dispersion has been reduced dramatically for POW 2012/13 with DEPI managing now 4 out of 5 Adaptation outputs and all 3 REDD+ outputs, and DEWA being accountable for 2 out of 4 Science and Outreach outputs. While DRC managed two CC outputs under POW 2010/11 it retained none for POW 2012/13.

"The portfolio considered by the evaluation1 is comprised of about 89 projects with EF and/or XB funding.

At least one third (about 35) of the 89 projects, 25 of which are under mitigation, are sub-projects or initiatives that are under umbrella projects for budgetary and administrative purposes. This brings the “actual” count in PIMS (where sub-projects under the umbrella projects are not listed separately unless they went through PRC) to about 57 project",neutral
"Rough estimates indicate that, for the portfolio considered by the evaluation, DTIE was responsible for approximately 40 per cent of the planned financial volume of CCSP work but 61 per cent of the programmed (mobilised) volume. DEPI is responsible for 45 per cent of the planned funding, but only 36 per cent of the programmed funding. Other divisions, mainly DEWA and DCPI, shared the remainder.",neutral

The UNEP climate change strategy explicitly notes the significance of partnerships to drive the work.,neutral
"nce UNEP is a non-resident agency, it must rely on operating through partners at the country level, with collaboration between ROs and other UNEP Offices.

Local partners also often bring complementary technical skills, as is the case for the global/regional partners. Its closest country-level relationships are usually government counterparts or UNDP, though sometimes UNEP might operate through another development agency, national institution, et",neutral

"The evaluation reaches a number of conclusions and makes a series of recommendations to further enhance UNEP planning documents and processes with the goal of improving organisational performance. Conscious that UNEP planning processes are already perceived as rather cumbersome and time-consuming, the proposed recommendations do not add additional requirements, procedures or processes but aim to strengthen those already in place. There are generally fewer recommendations for the higher level planning processes and documents (MTS and PoWs), whilst more opportunities for improvement have been identified at the Programme Framework and Project Document level.

While ratifications of the already existing chemicals Conventions grew, it is not clear how this is attributable to the efforts of the Sub-programme as opposed to the work of the Secretariat to the Convention CoPs.

The evaluation identified three drivers and three assumptions that are required for enhanced country capacity (on the dimensions discussed above) to effectively lead to changes in environmental governance and management for better crisis prevention and preparedness and more sustainable recovery from disasters and conflicts. These drivers and assumptions are highlighted in italic and discussed in the following paragraphs.,neutral
"Integration of environmental considerations into UN and other international organisations is considered a crucial outcome driver because these organisations often provide support to countries that goes beyond capacity building, directly supporting government agencies and other stakeholders with environmental management for recovery and improved resilience from disasters and conflicts. Certain organisations also play a major role in replication and up‐scaling of UNEP capacity building efforts beyond the relatively limited geographical areas where UNEP is directly active. On the other hand, integration of environmental considerations into DRR, peacebuilding and recovery efforts led or executed by other international organisations also has a direct bearing on the environment and by making these organisations aware of their own environmental impact it is likely that they pay greater attention to the environment in their own programming",neutral
"Another important driver for more sustainable and equitable environmental governance is adequate interaction, alignment and complementarity between groups and organisations involved in environmental management. UNEP has directly and indirectly contributed to environmental cooperation at the supra‐national level (between two or more countries), in particular through the Environment and Security Initiative (ENVSEC) partnership and the ECP programme. At the national level, UNEP’s support has been focussed so far on relationships between government institutions, and in particular on bringing the environmental agencies – which received the lion’s share of UNEP’s capacity building support – out of isolation and obtain stronger cooperation from sector ministries such as agriculture, forestry, water and mining. In the field of DRR, the APELL approach is also very conducive to building relationships between government, the private sector and communities living and working close to industrial areas",neutral

In addition, UNEP was to focus its activities on a limited number of countries requesting its support (emphasis on least developed countries and small island developing states) to achieve more tangible results and greater impact, rather than spreading effort too thinly, particularly where there was clear potential for results and transfer of knowledge or to build synergies with other UNEP subprogrammes, UN agencies and other partners, or where opportunities existed to build on past work.",neutral

"In 2000, UNHCR’s Evaluation and Policy Analysis Unit (EPAU) published a case study of urban refugees in New Delhi as part of a larger evaluation of the implementation of the 1997 UNHCR policy on refugees in urban areas.

The new policy is a marked reversal of the 1997 policy, a document that focused more on reducing assistance and security issues for urban refugees and less on protection.",neutral

"At the invitation of the UNHCR Chief of Mission in India, PDES decided to revisit New Delhi in January 2013 to examine to what extent the new policy is being implemented and how deeply ingrained the philosophical shift of the new policy is in the mindsets of UNHCR staff and partners.",neutral
"A return to New Delhi was especially interesting since the author of the new policy had been on the earlier evaluation team and noted that the earlier mission seeded many elements of the new policy. Two-thirds of the 2000 evaluation made explicit suggestions for amending the 1997 policy and laid considerable groundwork for the 2009 policy. Thus, a return to New Delhi in January 2013 to evaluate the viability of the new, more progressive policy toward urban refugees and the applicability of the twelve protection strategies was perhaps an overdue analysis. Both the city and the refugee population have expanded in the intervening years. Over this timespan, the refugees and asylum seekers diversified from an almost all Afghan demographic to now include people from Myanmar, Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Eritrea, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and other African, Middle Eastern and Eastern European countries. Now, New Delhi is a bustling national capital with a beautiful new airport, elevated highways, and metro lines to keep people moving around its ballooning spaces. The city’s teeming economy has a lot to offer refugees especially in comparison to the situations reviewed in other recent evaluations of urban refugees. Yet, India’s recent and much touted burgeoning economy sits in paradox to its other source of notoriety: poverty. In response to the juxtaposition of an economic boom and a persistently high poverty rate, India has spent billions of dollars on poverty alleviation schemes in the past decade. Even though many Indians continue to be mired in poverty, the government provides access to health, education and potentially to selected poverty alleviation schemes to refugees. This is all the more significant since India is neither a signatory to the 1951 Convention nor does it have a national refugee law. 2 Despite India’s ad hoc approach to their legal status, there is no tradition of refoulement, discrimination or detention of refugees. Moreover, India has recently agreed to allow mandate refugees to apply for long-term visas that would provide them with the legal right to work and access to all academic institutions. Taking all this into consideration, New Delhi appears to be a city with distinct advantages for today’s refugees",neutral
"Even so, many of the refugees in New Delhi would like to move on to a third country and recently the UNHCR Office has spent considerable resources in discouraging unrealistic aspirations for resettlement. It is gradually becoming clear to these refugees that India may not be a way-station but a destination. And at this destination, refugees need to navigate how to live amongst the multitudes of the indigenous poor. For the most part, refugees are only accessing entry-level jobs and they are competing with Indian nationals for them. The compensation from these jobs is so meager that most households need to have two or more people working full-time to cover rent and food. Children are dropping out of school or only attending partially in order to supplement the family income. There can be security risks in traveling to and from work especially the occasional and lucrative catering jobs at large night time parties. Sexual gender-based violence (SGBV) is prevalent in New Delhi and refugee women are victimized because they look different. . African refugees are the target of racist attacks.",neutral
"In trying to avail themselves of services, refugees have learned they must navigate a slow paced bureaucracy. This is of particular concern in the face of the promises of the long stay visas.",neutral
"With those visas, and the accorded rights to work and enroll in any academic institutions, refugees in Delhi could break the cycle of poverty and begin to establish a higher degree of income security. Thus far, the Myanmarese refugees are obtaining the long stay visas easily and the Government of India has agreed to waive the associated fees. It is hoped that all other refugee communities will acquire these visas with the same facility. With the work opportunities this visa affords in an up and coming city, it can open doors to a better socio- economic status. Thus, it is understandable that refugees dream of resettlement to a more developed nation while they are confronting the paradoxes of modern India. However, poverty is not grounds for resettlement. The very limited spaces for resettlement to Australia, Canada, and the USA are reserved for refugees with protection needs that cannot be met in India and the limited spaces may be subject to resettlement countries preferences for particular nationalities.",neutral
"For the existent refugees in New Delhi, there is not much connection with families for reunification claims in Australia, Canada and the USA. Most of the family reunification opportunities would be in Europe. Thus, the UNHCR Office has a two-fold challenge in implementing the new policy for refugees in urban areas: 1) shifting the mindset of refugees from leaving India to staying and exploiting the opportunities offered, and, 2) advocating with the Government of India to make the lives of refugees tenable by actualizing their promises of widely recognized documents that would enable refugees to compete for more than slum-based opportunities.",neutral

"When a UNHCR evaluation team visited a Somali refugee school and community centre in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, it found that all of the children and young people there had large pieces of paper pinned to their clothing, bearing a variety of different messages. One of them read: “Thanks UNHCR for visiting our refugee education centre. But when will our turn come?” Another stated: “We are Somali refugee children. We have very few opportunities here. Please help us resettle in a third country. Thanks UNHCR, thanks UNHCR, thanks UNHCR.” These brief slogans provide an appropriate starting point for this report, as they capture very graphically the main preoccupations of refugees who are living in urban areas of Malaysia: first, their inability to establish a secure and long-term future for themselves there; second, their eager quest to be admitted to another country where such opportunities would be available to them; and third, a firm belief that UNHCR is the only organization that can deliver such outcomes. Somalis represent just a small proportion of the 100,000 refugees and asylum seekers living in Malaysia. The majority of this number originate from Myanmar and most have taken up residence in urban areas such as Kuala Lumpur and Penang. The situation of this substantial urban refugee population is in all respects a very difficult one. Malaysia does not have a legal framework governing refugee and asylum issues.

Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations 23. This section on conclusions begins with an overall statement on UNHCR’s interventions during the L3 emergency in DRC. This statement is followed by summary versions of conclusions and recommendations linked to a specific conclusion.,neutral
The formulation of a responsible transition strategy with policies and additional tools should enable UNHCR to strengthen its support and help States to meet the challenges involved in individual RSD. The ability to influence matters is predicated on a government’s willingness to involve UNHCR and will often also depend on the context specific motives behind the new procedur,neutral
The review recommends (1) the identification of a limited set of global indicators for continued mandate RSD to capture these situations.,neutral
"Based on such assessment, the review recommends (2) the identification of “benchmarks” as an agreed, country specific road map towards the creation or reform of RSD in a number of areas such as legislation, organisation of RSD, reception services, transfer arrangements and operational support.",neutral
"For strategic planning purposes a further useful category would be that of country specific “foundations” towards a sustainable, quality RSD system which is fully integrated in national structures and embedded in national checks and balances. These foundations require a much longer perspective and should fit in agendas for development, good governance and the rule of law.",neutral
the report recommends (5) that UNHCR clarifies the minimum procedural requirements for RSD based on a realistic appreciation of the challenges involved. Especially in the area of independent appeals and legal assistance international standards and practice have evolved.,neutral
"Much will depend on the wishes of the government, possible protection gaps, the risk of national structures becoming overwhelmed from the start, and standards of fairness. The report recommends (6) that different options for continued processing are considered in a future strategy on transition.",neutral
"For the purpose of greater consistency, the preliminary report recommends (8) policy formulation on principles, considerations and criteria, based on a residual accountability in the context of UNHCR’s supervisory responsibility. It should include the development of model SOPs for such mandate RSD procedures.",neutral
"Although funding may provide general leverage, its use as a tool for encouraging concrete improvements in RSD appears to be difficult and limited. The preliminary report recommends (9) a closer look at the funding of national RSD structures, including the possibility of gradual phasing out schedules and ways to improve the accessibility and analysis of data in the context of results based management where funding continues.",neutral
"t is recommended (10) to either review the Results Framework in this regard to provide for clearer planning, reporting and information gathering or to provide for a separate more detailed monitoring and reporting tool.",neutral
"Adequate resources are not only necessary to support authorities when they start the new procedure but throughout the transition process, from assessment and planning to transfer, implementation and consolidation.",neutral
Resource inputs are also necessary to work on the foundations for a sustainable protection environment at same time.,neutral
The report recommends (11) that UNHCR considers establishing benchmarks for protection staffing in situations of transition. They could serve as a useful complement to those formulated in 2010 for mandate RSD operations.,neutral
"The answers to the questionnaire and additional research have resulted in a historical graph, which is contained in annex III to the report. Although information can be retrieved from different sources, the report recommends (12) the creation of a consolidated historical database on the relevant phases (adoption of legislation, establishment of procedure, actual functioning of RSD).",neutral
"Ultimately, the political willingness to invest in an adequate system and the humanitarian spirit with which it is operated will be decisive for the proper identification of refugees.",neutral
"In addition, it is proposed (vi) to complement the findings with a more strategic inquiry into recent alternative, protection sensitive strategies which have helped to relieve pressures on individual RSD systems. In order to put RSD transition policy and practice in a broader perspective, it is finally recommended (vii) to review the functioning and resourcing of mandate RSD in selected countries that are engaged in RSD transition. In the proposed methodology, it is foreseen to pay attention to the views of asylum-seekers and refugees and to make good use of the expertise of experts from governments and NGO partners.",neutral
"As convener for the shelter cluster for conflict situations, UNHCR has an important role to play in resource mobilisation and there has been a steady increase in UNHCR’s share of shelter funding over time, a significant majority received through the CERF RR window.",neutral
There is a lack of evidence to show that CERF has been successful in leveraging additional income for UNHCR and there was some suggestion that the opposite may be true.,neutral
mplementing the recommendations of the review will help ensure that UNHCR is able to maximise the effectiveness of CERF funding in the future.,neutral
"tatistics as of end of December 2014 indicated that the number of persons whose claims were awaiting determination was 34,011, comprising 2,696 in Dadaab and 769 in Alinjugur; 24,120 in Kakuma and 6,426 in Nairobi. The number of pending claims in Kakuma remains substantial, and will require concerted efforts to address it and ensure that decision-making can continue to keep pace with new claims. In other locations, claim numbers of the current order in the other locations are likely to be manageable only if decision-making rates increase progressively beyond those seen in the first six months of the transition process, from July to December 2014, and planned measures are implemented to use simplified processing and other streamlined approaches to claims where appropriate, as well as improving efficiency in regular RSD. The efficacy of decision-making will need to be monitored continuously, and the capacity of the system to manage its caseload may come into question if claims were to increase substantially, current and planned streamlining and efficiency measures cannot be implemented, or significant further backlogs were to build up. In such cases, the possibility of further extension of the transition period, along with other measures to reinforce and expedite claim processing, would need further to be considered.",neutral
"Planned cooperation between DRA and UNHCR aims at joint registration and data-sharing in all RSD locations in Kenya, but these arrangements need to foresee the ultimate establishment of a comprehensive, cost-effective registration system in DRA which can support RSD and other protection activities Kenya-wide. Plans for future use and eventual handover of information in UNHCR’s ProGres database will need to ensure that safeguards to guarantee data protection and limitations on the use of data are developed and maintained, as well as regulating ongoing access for UNHCR to data on asylum seekers and refugees to enable it to carry out its protection and assistance activities.",neutral
"It will also be important to ensure that refugees granted status by UNHCR pursuant to its mandate prior to 1 July 2014 are recognised, and the entitled people granted status, under national law, as has occurred in other contexts. This will be crucial to ensure legal certainty and continued respect of those peoples’ rights, without overloading the system with a further large caseload.",neutral
"A mechanism for on-going self-evaluation and quality assurance by DRA will also be needed in the future. It will be important to clarify the role of UNHCR in supporting RSD after the transition process, as well as other aspects of its supervisory role under the Geneva Convention, along with that of civil society and other partners. A potential role for UNHCR as an observer in the RSD process post-transition, at least for an initial period, should be considered by DRA and UNHCR.",neutral
"This is particularly the case in camps, where both asylum-seekers and refugees (although in principle not those whose claims are rejected) are entitled to services and support. Further efforts are needed in working with the Kenyan authorities to ensure that the RSD process can lead to accessible, viable durable solutions; in particular rights to work, greater free movement and potential prospects of citizenship in line with Kenyan law.",neutral
"The passing of the Refugees Act 2006 has led a process of ‘constitutionalisation’ in respect of RSD, reception and treatment of refugees and asylum seekers in Kenya. The Act establishes DRA and sets out a comprehensive institutional RSD framework, yet its implementation proves problematic in practice. Among other outstanding steps still required under the legislation, along with the establishment of the Refugee Appeal Board, the appointment of the Commissioner for Refugee Affairs, and the new form for Notification of Recognition of Refugee Status, have not to date been published in the official Gazette.",neutral
"National security actions taken in 2012-13 and 2014 with regard to encampment.– including measures to enforce encampment rules in the 2006 Act, have highlighted the vulnerability of undocumented urban asylum seekers and refugees in Kenya. Recently- adopted legislative changes under the Security Laws (Amendment) Act 2014, which would compel refugees to relocate in refugee camps and limit the number of refugees in the country to 150,000, would have worsened their situation considerably. While these provisions were annulled by a High Court judgment in early 2015, they demonstrate the level of political sensitivity around the presence of urban refugees, and around refugee issues in Kenya more broadly.",neutral
"The findings of a survey of a small sample of persons of concern selected by UNHCR, conducted in Nairobi and Dadaab, seek to provide some individual expressions of the perspectives of asylum seekers and refugees regarding the ongoing transition process.",neutral
"In order to achieve an efficient and sustainable national RSD system, as part of an effective refugee protection framework in Kenya more broadly, it is imperative that the political will on the part of the authorities to take charge of registration and refugee status determination is translated into a commitment to allocate sufficient and sustained resources (both human and financial) in the coming years. Other essential steps include establishment of the relevant institutions and civil service posts, and allocation of national resources to the process. As Kenya continues to be exposed to the serious threat of terrorist acts, there is an evident interest for the country in enhancing oversight and control over who legally resides on Kenyan soil. However, there is also a risk of excessive politicisation of refugee issues in Kenya, which could undermine the RSD process and pose risks for the institution of international protection more broadly, as political rhetoric aimed at forcing Somali refugees to return to their country has increased in volume and intensity. The establishment and ongoing operation of a well-functioning RSD process needs to be clearly separated from political discussions and purely based on legal, technical and practical considerations. Any political pressure disproportionately to curtail the rights of refugees, contrary to national and international law, should be resisted in favour of measured responses that respect the rule of law.",neutral
"Clarifying the role of UNHCR before, during and after transition, and enshrining it in clear agreements with national authorities, is also an important priority for current and future transition processes. UNHCR is encouraged to take account of the insights and lessons derived from the experience in Kenya and reflect them in guidance, advice and support provide to RSD transitions in other countries and regions worldwide",neutral
"Given this context, UNHCR’s role in Turkey is quite unlike its role in a “classic” refugee emergency. Arguably it is different than its role in Jordan or Lebanon, and closer to what might be expected whenever UNHCR is engaged in a large-scale refugee influx in an advanced economy with a strong government. Most of the established mechanisms of humanitarian coordination, models of assistance, and conventions of donor relations are irrelevant in the Turkey context – and in response UNHCR has needed to configure itself quite differently from the norm. Characteristics of UNHCR’s approach in Turkey are: a major emphasis on policy and advocacy for protection over programming; a primary role in supporting government rather than providing direct assistance to refugees; a strong reliance on senior national staff to provide effective liaison with senior government counterparts; and maintaining a low profile – occasionally to the consternation of donors and rights advocates.",neutral
"rom the outset in April 2011, coordination of the Syrian refugee response in Turkey has been firmly managed by the Government of Turkey. Initially the Government declined offers of assistance from UNHCR, so UN agencies and INGOs mainly organized themselves in parallel to the Government. This led to a situation that continues today, consisting of three loosely connected communities of coordination: (a) a Government mechanism that has itself evolved over the five year period, and where the Government primarily coordinates its own substantial programs, involving some NNGOs and occasionally UNHCR; (b) a UN system that coordinates UN agencies and IOM; an",neutral
"From the outset, protection was UNHCR’s top priority in Turkey. Its two key objectives were supporting the Government’s revision of the regulatory framework, and supporting the Government’s machinery for Syrian refugee registration.

"However, it will not significantly reduce the population of Syrians in Turkey, whose birth rate alone is greater than any likely resettlement rate.",neutral
The evaluation team strongly recommends that gathering required data and then addressing these risks through coherent interagency action plans become an immediate protection priority.,neutral
"he Turkish Government provides unprecedented access for Syrian children to Government schools, but the attendance levels are still very low for many reasons including the Arabic-Turkish language barrier. Furthermore, there is no reliable data on educational achievement.",neutral
"Looking ahead, the evaluation team concluded that the education sector is the single most important priority for significant further programming investment by UNHCR. Education is more than a right in itself; in the Turkey context, it is clear that education is key to reducing the incidence of early marriage and child labour, to social cohesion, and to sustainable livelihoods, as well as preparing",neutral
"To be efficient in this context, UNHCR first needs to increase its education staff in-country, both in Ankara and in the field offices. Secondly UNHCR should focus upon its agreed operating space within the negotiated division of labour: notably higher education, non-formal education and Turkish language training - aspects of education that are not being covered by other UN agencies. This is an area where UNHCR should identify specific institutional and policy bottlenecks, pin down a few areas where a strategic investment can leverage greater returns, and then deliver on those specific activities at scale.",neutral
"While Syrian refugees currently benefit from an exceptional welcome from both the Turkish Government and the Turkish people, this cannot be taken for granted as both the political and economic contexts of Turkey could change rapidly and at any time. The refugee welcome is wearing thin as it becomes increasingly evident that refugees are going to stay for some time in Turkey, and more visibly compete with Turkish nationals for jobs, housing and public services, especially in hotspots where refugee concentrations are high and the local economy is stressed.",neutral
"Anticipating and managing the social cohesion challenges ahead will require active engagement with local governments, stronger refugee representation, proactive strategic communications (with social cohesion and not UNHCR fundraising as the goal), more effective outreach from existing community centres, as well as large-scale and visible investment by development actors and INGOs in Turkish communities that are heavily affected by Syrian refugees.",neutral
"To consolidate this progress and address some remaining critical gaps, UNHCR needs to increase management emphasis on coordination and on strategic communications, and focus policy and advocacy work specifically on the exceptional vulnerabilities to SGBV, early marriage and child labour experienced by Syrian women and children in Turkey.",neutral
"The Ukraine programme also provides an important opportunity to test an integrated refugee and IDP programme, as refugees and IDPs distributed across the country have similar needs met by similar UNHCR responses that could be combined into an integrated programme. The government recovery plan, the Multi‐Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) and the new UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) also provide an opportunity for UNHCR to do business differently in Ukraine in terms of advancing durable solutions in a joined‐up way, and acting as a facilitator rather than an implementer of development programming in IDP‐affected regions.",neutral
"As a result, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Bureau and the Executive Office of the High Commissioner tasked the UNHCR Policy Development and Evaluation Service to carry out an evaluation mission to review UNHCR’s Confidence Building Measures with special emphasis on the following aspects:  Management and operational issues: are the CBM activities implemented by UNHCR cost-effective and have other alternatives been considered? Is there adequate fund- raising for this operation? Is the UNHCR configuration in the field, including staffing, suited to the needs? Is the MINURSO and CIVPOL support achieving synergies with the CBM activities implemented by UNHCR? 2  Humanitarian impact on beneficiaries: what is the impact, if any, on the lives on Saharawi families who have been separated for decades and on their prospects of finding durable solutions?  Impact on the confidence among the parties: to what extent did the CBM activities implemented by UNHCR contribute to improve the confidence among the concerned parties? Do they complement UNHCR’s core mandate and the efforts of the Secretary General to seek reconciliation and to find a political solution? 7. After the evaluation mission, a high-level delegation from UNHCR’s Executive Office and the MENA Bureau undertook a regional mission to Algeria, including the refugee camps near Tindouf, Morocco, the Western Sahara Territory and Mauritania.",neutral
"In December 2008, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees launched a Special Initiative on Protracted Refugee Situations, intended to promote durable solutions and improvements in living standards for the world’s growing number of long-term refugees. Several refugee situations were identified for particular attention in the context of this initiative, including Afghan refugees in Iran and Pakistan, refugees in Croatia and Serbia, Eritrean refugees in eastern Sudan, Burundian refugees in Tanzania and Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in Bangladesh. UNHCR’s Policy Development and Evaluation Service (PDES) is currently reviewing the progress that has been made in the implementation of the special initiative, focusing on the extent to which UNHCR has been able to (a) exercise its mandate for durable solutions; (b) play a catalytic role in relation to the engagement of other actors; and (c) improve the quality of life for refugees while the search for solutions continues.",neutral
"In the recent past, Bangladesh has experienced two influxes of refugees from Myanmar, the first in 1978 and the second in 1991-92. Around 250,000 people were involved both times. Both influxes were followed by large-scale repatriation exercises whose voluntariness was seriously questioned. Some of those who were repatriated subsequently fled again to Bangladesh, but many were unable to recover their former and government-acknowledged refugee status. Bangladesh is currently host to some 29,000 recognized refugees who are accommodated in camps and an estimated 36,000 unrecognized refugees who have congregated in makeshift sites to which UNHCR and other international and national humanitarian actors have limited access. In addition, there are thought to be at least 200,000 undocumented Rohingya living in host communities and who are also considered to be of concern to UNHCR. Bangladesh is not well placed to cope with this protracted refugee situation. The country is confronted with extreme poverty and high rates of population growth, and is increasingly affected by natural disasters and climate change. The refugees are to be found primarily in remote and impoverished areas of Bangladesh which have not benefited from the modest economic growth that has recently taken place in some other parts of the country. From the government’s perspective, there has been a lack of concerted international action to address the circumstances that forced the Rohingya to leave Myanmar and which now obstruct their repatriation. Bangladesh also considers there has been inadequate international understanding and support with respect to the refugee impact on host communities. The presence and general tolerance of such large numbers of Rohingya in Bangladesh derives in part from the social, ethnic, linguistic and religious characteristics that they share with the host community, particularly their common adherence to Islam. Even so, political 2 and public opinion in Bangladesh is generally not well disposed towards the refugees. And although",neutral
"Unsurprisingly in these circumstances, the operational environment is a very challenging one.",neutral
"A number of the administrative practices which caused the Rohingya to leave Myanmar – including restrictions on movement, secondary education, marriage, livelihoods and the acquisition of skills – are mirrored by the restrictions placed upon them in their country of asylum. In areas such as health and education, as well as the supply of food, water and fuel, the refugees are poorly served. Refugee self-reliance initiatives have not attained their intended goals. Without freedom of movement and the ability to pursue educational and livelihoods opportunities outside the camps, it has proved very difficult for the Rohingya to generate additional income. As a result, refugees are increasingly driven to adopt negative coping mechanisms. The absence of any durable solution adds to the frustration of the refugees and the demoralization of the humanitarian personnel who work on their behalf.",neutral
"First, as the three traditional durable solutions appear so elusive, alternative approaches should be considered. More specifically, there may be scope to advocate on behalf of a framework which provides refugees with a formal status that would allow them access to employment opportunities and government services. The fact that Bangladesh is itself highly dependent on income from migrant labour, and has recently signed the International Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers, is relevant in this respect. Second, while the country’s principal political parties have tended to vie with each other in arguing for tough refugee and asylum policies, there is scope for other voices to be heard in this discourse. Bangladesh, for example, has an educated elite, a vigorous civil society, NGO and human rights movement, as well as a strong corps of journalists and media representatives, all of whom could be mobilized on behalf of the effort to address this protracted refugee situation",neutral
"Third, it should be recalled that the Rohingya refugee situation is now a truly regional one, affecting not only Bangladesh but also countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia as well as India and the Middle East. This argues very strongly in favour of an Asia-Pacific approach to the issue, involving not only those states that are hosting refugees, but also countries such as China and India that have considerable influence throughout the region, as well as resettlement countries outside the region. A comprehensive plan of action",neutral
"The organization should immediately capitalize on this renewed interest, reminding the international community that the Rohingya are trapped not only in a protracted refugee situation, but also in a protracted situation of statelessness. The former problem will not be resolved without a resolution of the latter.",neutral
"In this respect, it should be noted that Bangladeshi nationality law is based on the principle of jus solis, allowing all persons born in Bangladesh to acquire citizenship at birth. Refugee children currently represent 59 per cent of the camp population, more than half of them born in Bangladesh. An Action Plan with detailed recommendations is presented in Annex 1 of this report and should be used by the UNHCR office in Bangladesh to introduce and report on new activities, to measure progress towards the organization’s objectives and to maintain institutional memory. Finally, the Annex should also be a useful complement to the compendium of operational assessments and mission reports compiled by UNHCR in Bangladesh, and which captures all of the assessments made between January 2007 and January 2011.",neutral
"UNHCR should continue to look for opportunities to implement projects that other agencies have avoided or neglected, even if this means implementing in remote communities. UNHCR should avoid beginning projects, such as microfinance, that require on-going assistance and training provisions, unless this can be secured for the future.",neutral
"Many papers have discussed UNHCR’s return and reintegration programmes, what the organization does in countries of origin, and how it seeks to bridge the gap between immediate humanitarian assistance and longer-term development. This gap in particular – often called the humanitarian-development nexus – is increasingly the subject of study, as UNHCR intensifies its search for better strategies and methods.",neutral
"The true test of any reintegration programme is this: did it work in the eyes of the local population? But how and when do we measure this effectiveness? A 2001 UNHCR paper pointed out that many evaluations tended to take place while UNHCR still had a significant presence in the country, rather than after its phase-out, thus, the organization was unable to assess the longer-term consequences of its interventions. Important learning opportunities might therefore have been missed. What can be done about this?",neutral
"Eastern Sudan has hosted refugees from neighbouring Eritrea since the late 1960s, making this refugee situation one of the most protracted in the world. Peaking at around 800,000 in 1990, the refugee population currently stands in the region of 80,000, the majority of them living in camps",neutral
"The Eritreans are not prepared to repatriate in view of the human rights situation in Eritrea and their opposition to the country’s government. While there is a growing interest in resettlement, few of the refugees have access to this solution.",neutral
"In such circumstances, the only viable solution is that of local integration.",neutral
"nd in that respect, the environment is in several respects a favourable one. Most of the refugees who arrived before 2001 have the same ethnicity, language, culture and religion as their Sudanese hosts. Many were born or brought up in Sudan and consider it to be their home",neutral
"While the refugees are under no pressure to return to their country of origin, and while Sudan has kept its borders open to a significant influx of new arrivals from Eritrea, the government in Khartoum has not been prepared to offer the long-term refugees the option of naturalization and citizenship. At the same time, the Eritreans are confronted with legal obstacles that prevent them from owning land and property, which place constraints on their freedom of movement and which make it difficult for them to enter the formal labour market.",neutral
"This review suggests that UNHCR should pursue a three-pronged approach to the refugee situation in eastern Sudan. First, the organization should advocate on behalf of refugee rights, so as to limit and ideally remove the restrictions that are currently placed on the Eritreans. As a longer-term objective, UNHCR should encourage the government to provide refugees with access to Sudanese citizenship.",neutral

"A few years later, in 1999, I was in Mozambique to evaluate the impacts of a Canadian-German community participation and development project. I was taken to a small village, some miles from the city of Beira to interview community members. The project mangers expressed dismay that they had not succeeded in enlisting the participation of an important number of community residents and they were unable to determine the reason. I was told that the community consisted entirely of people who had fled as refugees to Malawi and returned after the war to resume their lives. I was assured that the community, minus the many who had been killed, was intact. The people who left returned to the same place. In talking to the assembled village residents, however, I asked the question that anyone who has worked over the years with migrant populations would ask: “Were all of you who returned here from Malawi born in this community?” That question had never been asked. It turned out that approximately a third of the population originated from other parts of Mozambique but had chosen to relocate to this community because of its good land and favourable location. The village leaders confirmed that there was land available because of the high death toll and due to out migration. But, the newcomers were from different places and different tribes and had to be vetted before being accepted as community members. This process was still ongoing, hence the non-participation of certain residents. This experience has stayed with me as a clear demonstration of war-induced mobility in a traditional society.",neutral
"In El Salvador and Mozambique as in almost all countries that have experienced years of conflict, families and individuals are likely to lose - or choose to forget - the ties than have bound them for generations to a particular place. In every country where I have been privileged to evaluate the impacts of international assistance and post-conflict programmes, I have seen that conflicts are followed by accelerated rural-urban migration. The uprooted IDPs and refugees who desperately longed to return to their homes are living a few years later, in urban slums, and they are no longer differentiated by international donors or their own governments from poor people generally. Colombia, one of the two cases in this study, is somewhat exceptional in this regard in its designation of forcibly uprooted people in the category of victims of conflict in need of restitution. This study offers what I hope will be useful observations on the implications of Colombia’s policies and, on the Liberian side, the validity of seeking solutions for those forcibly displaced by means of a strategy intended to give priority to addressing poverty. Outsiders still have much to learn about how wars affect traditional societies and produce important changes in priorities, decision making, local authorities and local economies. I have remained particularly interested in the ongoing and difficult debates within UNHCR because it is the organization on the front line of response to refugees and IDPs.",neutral

"Operational challenges 13. The survey highlighted the significant degree of education that characterizes the Colombian refugee community in San Jose, with 39.7per cent having tertiary education qualifications and 42.7per cent having completed secondary school. However, the discrepancy between the level of education and the level of employment clearly shows the significant problems in obtaining employment, such that only 11.6per cent of the target groups were formally employed and a further 23.5per cent were self employed. The remainder was overwhelmingly unemployed. 14. Local integration programmes have therefore prioritised livelihoods and self- reliance. However, these efforts are often hampered by a lack of public awareness about the nature of refugee status. There has also been increased discrimination and xenophobia against Colombians, who are often perceived as a potential security threat. In recent years, a very restrictive immigration policy towards Colombians has resulted in a decrease in the number of visas issued and an increase in the number of unauthorized entries at the Panama border. 3 15. The changes in the government during this year and the implementation of new immigration legislation have also posed challenges.

Even so, a degree of tension has emerged in relation to the refugees’ presence, with the Afghans increasingly being perceived as undeserving migrants rather than as people who are in need of protection and solutions. A fragile legal system, coupled with stringent restrictions on the movement and residence of refugees, which bars all refugees and asylum seekers who arrived after the year 2000 from living in the main cities of Tajikistan including the capital Dushanbe, has contributed to the challenge of implementing UNHCR’s new urban refugee policy. The situation has been exacerbated by the organization’s very modest presence and resources in Tajikistan and its need to cooperate with a state which does not regard the refugee issue as a high priority.",neutral
"In these difficult circumstances, UNHCR’s Dushanbe Office, supported by the Regional Office for Central Asia and the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, should formulate an urban refugee strategy for Tajikistan that is based on four principal components of the new policy: • undertaking high-level advocacy with the Tajik authorities so as to gain acceptance of the notion of state responsibility and respect for international refugee protection principles; • establishing effective partnerships with governmental and non-governmental partners that can contribute to the task of providing refugees with adequate protection and durable solutions; • mobilizing additional human and financial resources for the organization’s activities in Tajikistan; and, • ensuring that refugees and other persons of concern to UNHCR are included in the programmes of other UN Country Team members, donor states and international financial institutions.

"Anecdotal evidence and some limited studies have shown that artistic activity is playing an important, though often overlooked, role in the lives of refugee camp residents. Despite the challenging conditions which most refugee camps present, many of them are nevertheless sites for artistic activity, according to reports from across the globe. Professional performers and artistic exhibits have made tours to camps to entertain residents and raise international awareness about the ongoing international refugee crisis.1 Other artists have come to camps to draw artistic inspiration from the lives of refugees.2 2. Among the most intriguing phenomena, however, are the artistic activities in camps in which refugees themselves have been actively engaged as initiators, participants and/or participatory audience members. Such activities may provide useful tools for improving the quality of life for camp residents: principally, as a vehicle to address psychosocial issues; as an educational tool; and as an effective medium for behavior change communication. 3. Such activities are in harmony with the trend in humanitarian policy-making toward finding holistic approaches to refugee crises. Policies are gradually reflecting an increased emphasis on the psychosocial dimension of humanitarian need.3",neutral
"Artistic activity, especially that which involves active participation, may provide tools to address the holistic wellbeing of refugees in camps. The healing properties of the arts are well known on an anecdotal basis, and arts therapists have explored the practical implications for treatment of patients in a wide range of situations, from domestic violence to war-related trauma.5 Moreover, artistic activity addresses psychosocial wellness not only in ways that can treat each individual not only as an individual but also as an integral participant in a larger cultural context. 5. The very range of levels of formality, from ad hoc private performance to official public presentations, may help counteract the artificial and potentially intrusive nature of humanitarian interventions, necessary and life-saving though they may be. Artistic activity can provide an air of ―real life‖ amidst the mundanely surreal ethos of a camp, a reminder of a multifaceted human identity beyond that of ―refugee.‖ 6. Creative activity devised and enacted by refugees themselves may also help restore agency injured along the journey of flight and acceptance of refugee status. In some cases, at least, the many benefits of artistic activity may be enjoyed at significantly less financial cost than alternative programs aimed at similar ends, making such programs more widely accessible in areas in which funds are already stretch to their limit covering the basic needs of physical survival.",neutral
"This real-time evaluation (RTE) was undertaken to review UNHCR’s emergency response to the population displacement occurring within Cote d’Ivoire and across the border into Liberia as a result of the Ivorian election crisis from late November 2010 onwards. This was a slow-onset emergency, characterised in the early stages by largely pre- emptive displacement which began to increase in pace by the third week of December after a series of clashes in north-western Côte d’Ivoire. The RTE captures the situation as it was at the end of February 2011, a moment when the overall humanitarian situation was deteriorating, as the political and security crisis deepened. Some 40,000 refugees had already crossed the border into Liberia, and some 38,500 were believed to be internally displaced in western Côte d’Ivoire. In Liberia, the refugees were being hosted in more than 70 villages along the border, and the first camp had just opened. In Côte d’Ivoire, IDPs had sought refuge with host families and in schools and other temporary sites in the west of the country. Owing in part to the public perception that the UN mission (ONUCI) was politically aligned with President-elect Alassane Ouattara, UN staff had been withdrawn from western Côte d’Ivoire for several weeks for security reasons, and had only recently returned to the field",neutral
"The response was also shaped by the institutional architecture of the UN presence in Liberia, structured around the presence of an integrated peacekeeping mission and a ‘Delivering as One’ model, which aims to draw on the technical capacities of individual agencies in pursuit of common objectives. The refugee emergency was regarded as politically significant, coming in an election year and amid concerns that a major conflict in Côte d’Ivoire might have a destabilising effect in Liberia. The refugee crisis therefore attracted a higher level of attention from the UN system and the Government of Liberia than it might otherwise have done.",neutral
What can be learned from this experience for future emergencies? Three key findings emerge:,neutral
"irst, in a refugee emergency, a rapid and effective operational response by UNHCR must be matched by strong leadership which draws effectively on the network of partners available in country, clearly identifies roles and responsibilities based on a realistic assessment of capacities, and provides partners with the services they need in order to be able to deliver effectively, including information management and a fund- raising platform. It should also draw on UNHCR’s institutional expertise in defining the protection and solutions framework which should shape the collective response, and should situate it within a cross-border and regional perspective. The process of defining responsibilities and mobilising capacities must start in the contingency planning phase. It also needs to be facilitated by a clearer understanding with key partner agencies at a global level as to how inter-agency coordination of refugee emergencies should be managed, and the reinforcement of technical services in fundraising and information management. Second, contingency planning and preparedness measures have both an inter-agency and an internal UNHCR dimension. Plans developed together with partners need to be matched with internal preparedness measures, and a clear identification of the thresholds beyond which regional and country offices will require additional 5 reinforcement.",neutral
"Third, a defining feature of an effective emergency response is an early and rapid situation analysis, coupled with an assessment of existing capacity within the country office, and identification of additional resources needed in order to support effective leadership and coordination and at the same time to deliver the response in the field. In a situation which is already moving into the response (as opposed to the preparedness) phase, this would normally call for the deployment of an emergency coordinator to provide support to the office in making this assessment, and determining, based on the situation on the ground, the shape that additional support should take, including the profiles of additional staff required. This process should form part of a standard operating mechanism for the corporate management of emergencies.",neutral
"Executive summary This literature review aims to synthesise what is currently known about labour market integration of resettled refugees. One aspect, widely acknowledged in the literature, is that a ‘refugee gap’ appears when comparing resettled refugees to other immigrants in terms of labour market integration. Analyses in multiple countries have shown that resettled refugees perform worse in measures of labour market integration compared to other immigrants and individuals in the short-term, even when controlling for differences in demographics such as age, education level, and level of host country language acquisition. This is alarming given the centrality of employment in the metrics of governments and refugees themselves. Yet, in the longer term, resettled refugee groups have been shown to be closing this gap, and some promising practices for further narrowing the gap can be identified. This review examines, given the available evidence, the extent to which resettled refugees have been able to integrate into the labour market of the host country, the barriers and resilience factors to labour market integration, and promising practices for improving labour market integration",neutral
"n Uganda, UNHCR worked with the over 60 partners including the Department of Refugees within the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), UN bodies, local and international NGOs. Refugees in Uganda have, in principle, access to public services and facilities at the same level as the nationals.

Education programming for refugees focused on pre-primary and primary schooling and investments in physical infrastructure, teacher recruitment and training and provision of 200 learning and training materials expanded access to education.",neutral
"Six months after the response, the primary school and early childhood enrolment was around 60% in Adjumani.",neutral

"In Ethiopia, UNHCR worked with over 40 partners among governmental entities, UN bodies, local and international NGOs. The main institutional partner is ARRA (Administration for Refugee and Returnee Affairs), the de facto responsible body for the protection of refugees, including registration, refugee status determination, camp management, security and protection, but also some other sectorial activities such as health and food distribution. South Sudanese refugees are formally required to reside in designated camps, but informally they are allowed to move outside the camps and to work in the informal sector. The camps do not 260 have enough land for cultivation except for very small-scale vegetable gardening.",neutral

As a result, standards for reception conditions at entry/transit points remained low. After the flooding in Leitchuor and some delays owing to the difficulty in finding suitable land and security concerns , the relocation of approximately 48,000 refugees from 350 Leitchuor to the newly opened camps was conducted expediently (in less than one month), under time pressure with national elections in Ethiopia and the rainy season approaching.",neutral

"Reliable mortality data was however extremely challenging in the first months of the response, community reporting on mortality was low, and dead were buried on the South Sudan side of the border. Anecdotal reports of high mortality in the first stages of the influx could not be confirmed and to date there continues to be limitations with accurate collection of mortality data.",neutral
"A substantial portion of the general dry food ration provided in the camps was sold or bartered in order to cover other unmet needs, and the ration did not last the full month for most families5 . A lack of income to purchase food prevented refugees from diversifying their diet.",neutral

Such potential risks are flagged by the Evaluation but obviously it is premature to draw conclusions.,neutral
"The Evaluation was told that there are economic benefits of repatriation to the receiving communities in Burundi. The returnees are described as an injection of a productive, skilled and self-sufficient agricultural and trading labour force into a depressed and re- source scarce society. At the same time, the group of 1972 returnees to Burundi appears, as mentioned, to struggle themselves because of the considerable problems they face in setting up sustainable livelihood",neutral

"The expectations of Pillar 3 are based on the interviews with NNTs, who did not have much information on what was going to happen. Their views were that relocation and local integration could lead to loss of family ties, traditions and culture and have negative economic consequences, if they were not able to access adequate land in the new loca- tion. For some people relocation was seen as an opportunity to move on, with UNHCR staff mentioning that young persons expected to leave farming and go to town once they have relocated and received their certificates.",neutral

"Other humanitarian organizations such as the ICRC and IFRC have shown that a centralized fleet management model is economical and sustainable. Instituting such a model take time and requires strong commitments at the highest level of the organization, as well as significant investments to ensure the institutionalization of strong processes and staff capacity building.",neutral
"The close association of the PoC with UN multidimensional peacekeeping missions, and more particularly with integrated missions, could partly explain why the engagement of UNHCR with PoC as a theme (as distinct from its actual involvement in a range of activities aimed at ensuring the protection of refugees and IDPs in the context of conflict) has not been so prominent. It is also explained by the fact that OCHA has come to assume a key role in briefings of the Security Council on PoC issues. On the other hand, UNHCR, in its capacity as Lead of the Global Cluster for Protection, has been involved closely with the PoC agenda, especially as it relates to peacekeeping",neutral
"The main actors in relation to PoC as a theme are obviously the Security Council, the Secretary-General with his related reports, the General Assembly‟s Special Committee on Peacekeeping and OCHA. If one looks at PoC from an operational viewpoint, then the main actors are the relevant parties to a conflict, including states and non-state actors, ICRC, the three protection-mandated UN agencies (OHCHR, UNHCR, UNICEF), UN peacekeeping missions and humanitarian NGOs",neutral
"The underlying objective of UNHCR‟s work with refugees, IDPs and stateless persons is to work to overcome their vulnerability through the creation of an effective protection regime, be it international or national. Perhaps in the concepts of vulnerability and the establishment of effective protection, there might be the nucleus of an integrating theme for the Office‟s work.",neutral
"The right to participate in political decision-making processes is recognized by the international community as a fundamental human right: “everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives... the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government.” This paper considers the importance of refugee participation in country of origin political processes, and the extent to which UNHCR should seek to facilitate or promote refugee engagement in such activities. The framing of contemporary international political order rests upon the notion that the liberal-democratic nation-state, personified by a government chosen by and accountable to its citizens, is a just and inclusive order that can protect fundamental rights. Yet refugee flight, by definition, indicates the failure of this model. Refugees, whether persecuted as a result of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, are excluded (sometimes in a very deliberate manner) from the structures of political power in their country of origin. The search for solutions to refugee situations is thus in part a struggle of the politically excluded for political inclusion. Researchers have frequently focused on the political identity of the refugee. However, previous studies have often tended to focus on the activities of so-called “refugee warriors“, the “spoilers” of regional peace-building initiatives who turn to violence in order to assert their demands for political inclusion. This paper does not look at that much discussed issue, but focuses instead on the development of UNHCR‟s role in facilitating or promoting the engagement of refugees in non-violent and civic country of origin political processes, including out- of-country voting. This paper consists of five parts. In the first section, the nature and dynamics of political participation are considered. The importance of political activity in general to democratic ideals of government is examined, as is the specific importance of political participation – both symbolic and substantive – to displaced populations. The second part of the paper looks briefly at UNHCR‟s past and present engagement with refugee politics. In the following section, the political and logistical challenges of refugee participation in country of origin elections are considered. The fourth section looks at other forms of peaceful political engagement, including emerging transnational political activities. These analyzes draw on material from a number of case studies, including but not limited to Eritrea (1993), Bosnia (1996), Liberia (1997 and 2002) Kosovo (1999), East Timor (1999), Afghanistan (2004, 2009), Iraqi (2005, 2010) and Southern Sudan (2010, 2011). The fifth and final part of the paper offers a number of conclusions and recommendations on how UNHCR might further develop its role in relation to refugee participation in country of origin politic",neutral
"This principle should, however, be applied flexibly, taking into consideration the capacities and strengths of humanitarian organizations already operating in the country or region concerned.” Moreover, UNHCR as Global Cluster Lead for Protection already has certain responsibilities for the protection of those affected by natural disasters, not least of all obligations arising from the principle of “provider of last resor",neutral
"The recently drafted Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) for the designation of the Protection Cluster Lead at the country-level take into account UNHCR‟s responsibilities as Global Cluster Lead. This draft, elaborated under the auspices of the Protection Cluster Working Group by the three protection-mandated agencies, with the participation of OCHA and the Office of the Representative of the Secretary- General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, was tabled at the IASC Working Group Meeting in April 2010",neutral
"For the three UN agencies involved, it is considered to be more of a clarification of existing policy rather than a new policy. For others in the IASC Working Group, especially the NGOs, and in the light of the Protection Cluster‟s performance in the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, they wanted a more fundamental review of the Lead Agency designation. It will be recalled that in a recent study of the international response to the Haiti Earthquake, Refugees International has proposed that in future natural disasters involving significant displacement, UNHCR should be the Lead of the Protection Cluster at the country-leve",neutral
"The SOPs, in their present draft form, are intended to more expeditiously assure that the protection needs of those affected by a natural disaster are taken care of. It should be noted that neither the High Commissioner‟s offer to EXCOM, nor the draft SOPs mean that UNHCR will automatically be the Lead of the Protection Cluster at the country-level in every future natural disaster. The SOPs provide a range of options for the Cluster Leadership role. Although they are oriented to UNHCR assuming such a role in specific circumstances, they do not lock UNHCR into this role. Their merit lies in designating the Lead Agency in a more prompt manner than is currently the case. Today, UNHCR is engaged in some twenty IDP operations related to conflict situations as Lead of the Protection Cluster and in eight of these it exercises the Lead Role for Emergency Shelter and in five a similar role for Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM). Funding patterns of UNHCR, as a whole, would suggest that the Office‟s increased involvement in IDP situations has not been to its financial detriment.",neutral
"Addressing these gaps calls for separate initiatives (currently under consideration), and these require different protection capacities to those required for IDP situations, especially for coordinating and leading the Protection Cluster at the country level.",neutral
"Given the systemic linkages between UNDAC disaster assessments, CERF Rapid Response Grants and Flash Appeals, UNHCR should give serious consideration to becoming an integral member of UNDAC teams, along with OCHA, UNDP, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. To ensure a holistic response by the international community in a natural disaster, it is important that there be a protection component in UNDAC assessments.",neutral
"It will be recalled that the proposed amendments to the Financial Rules (EC/60/SC/CRP.24) would have allowed such transfers pending receipt of funds from appeals. Even if these amendments had been accepted, there would still be a problem in that the contributions from the envisaged appeals have not eventuated.",neutral
"contribute to effective protection. Similarly, the range of other actors working in the Protection Cluster means that the type of protection activities making up this Cluster in a Flash Appeal can be quite diverse.",neutral
"The issue is also raised in the recent IASC-sponsored Cluster Approach Evaluation Phase 2. Most importantly, there should be a shared appreciation of the need for a broad, comprehensive, but operationally-oriented concept of protection by the three key potential Cluster Leads, so as to ensure coherence of approach should any of the three agencies be called upon to assume the Cluster Lead role in the Field.",neutral
The first relates to an intervention by UNHCR limited to the provision of Non-Food Items (NFIs). The second scenario focuses on an intervention where UNHCR‟s involvement is limited to the Protection Cluster. Here the concrete case of the Philippines Hurricanes was studied (2009). This choice of the Philippines was also dictated by the fact that UNHCR saw this as a prototype of future such interventions in natural disasters.,neutral
"The third scenario was a more generic calculation for a hypothetical intervention of UNHCR as Protection Cluster Lead in any natural disaster; this concluded that any such involvement for a 6 month period would cost in the order of $1 million. The fourth and fifth scenarios looked at the concrete interventions in Myanmar (2008) and Haiti (2010) as examples of a more general involvement in natural disasters, either with responsibility for particular Clusters (Myanmar) or without having a lead role in relation to any sector (Haiti). This latter operation was chosen as the UN response has been somewhat criticized and, on the basis of the UN performance to date in the Protection Cluster, some have called for UNHCR to be the lead agency in any future natural disaster involving significant displacement.",neutral
"Related to the costs of intervention is the question of the duration of a given operation. The work of the PCWG at the country-level, like that of all clusters, should be time-limited on the basis of the preliminary needs assessment. The work of the Cluster needs to be seen in the context of the ongoing work of the UN Country Team (UNCT) and various coordinating frameworks, such as United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), and be focused on protection issues arising from the natural disaster and not long-standing ones aggravated by the natural disaster; the latter are important but should be the focus of the ongoing work programme of the relevant UN members of the UNCT.",neutral
"For this reason, it would seem that the normal timeframe for the Protection Cluster‟s work in a given natural disaster should initially be planned for 6 months. The IASC needs to establish guidelines for the winding up of clusters, and for ensuring that Strategic Operational Frameworks for each Cluster in a given operation include an exit strategy. Otherwise, one will be confronted with open-ended engagements similar to protracted refugee situations.",neutral
"Partnerships are essential for effective protection delivery, be it in refugee or IDP situations. The key partner is the State with which rests the primary responsibility for protection, especially in IDP situations. Cluster interventions when called for by a State should primarily be about enhancing support to national structures. This is why the Protection Cluster might better be described as the Protection Support Cluster. A key actor at the country level for the effectiveness of the work of the Protection Support Cluster is the Resident Coordinator (RC)/Humanitarian Coordinator (HC). Often, many of the issues identified by the Protection Cluster are such that they need an input by a range of clusters which only the HC can assure.",neutral
"Furthermore, there needs to be close cooperation between all the Clusters in a given operation, especially between the Shelter, CCCM and Education Clusters. In regard to the last mentioned cluster, evacuation centres are invariably set up in schools. The return to normal life as expressed in schooling is often complicated by the use of school facilities for emergency accommodation. Above all, the leadership of the various clusters needs to be in the hands of experienced agency staff, and the rules for the functioning of the various clusters, especially the determination of who may participate in their work, should be looked into.",neutral
"Natural disasters will require a further gearing up, as the first response in the form of the UNDAC team is within a time frame of 24 hours.",neutral
"Moreover, given overall limited resources, the issue of prioritization of assistance for those affected in natural disasters becomes essential, and in this context, profiling of IDPs in natural disaster contexts, and registration of those in evacuation and relocation centres, are not just a management issue but a protection issue.",neutral
"It is in this perspective that UNHCR should seek to become part of the UNDAC. It should also seek to ensure that through the IASC, issues related to profiling of IDPs become the recognized responsibility of Protection Cluster Working Group (PCWG).",neutral
t is for this reason that any significant involvement of UNHCR in natural disaster-related IDP situations should be a regular subject of reporting in the document on programmes and funding presented to each session of the Standing Committee.,neutral
"The question has been raised about the possible impact of this further protection engagement on the Office‟s work with refugees, especially as UNHCR has recognized that there are protection capacity issues (urban refugees, asylum/migration and protracted refugee situations) still to be addressed by the Office.",neutral
"It is suggested that any further involvement in this new type of IDP operations by UNHCR should take place in an incremental manner with an involvement in 2010 limited initially to a specified number of natural disasters. Such a cautious approach (not dissimilar to the choice of the limited number of IDP conflict-related IDP pilot operations in 2006) would not necessarily be at variance with the draft SOPs under consideration, nor the High Commissioner‟s proposal to EXCOM. Nor does it jeopardize the need for greater clarity and speed in designating the Lead Agency of the Protection Cluster at the country level.",neutral
"It does imply, however, that the other two protection-mandated agencies will also need to develop, along the lines of the UNICEF study considered below, their capacity to coordinate and deliver a comprehensive form of protection in an operationally effective manner in natural disaster situations.",neutral
"Hopefully, this study may help in this regard.",neutral
"The High Commissioner, in the light of the likely significant demands flowing from any UNHCR involvement in natural disasters, may need to review the staffing implications of such involvement; as a minimum, two parts of UNHCR Headquarters will require strengthening, namely the Emergency Preparedness and Response Section (EPRS), and the second pillar in the revised DIP structure which will be dealing with the Protection Cluster. It is suggested that each of these be strengthened by the creation of two posts at the P-4 level.",neutral
"This study has mainly been based on a review of relevant documents and interviews with relevant UNHCR staff; it has benefited particularly from mission reports on UNHCR‟s involvement in recent natural disasters, and from the IASC evaluations (first and second) of the Cluster Approach.",neutral
The principal findings and recommendations of the evaluation can be summarized as follows.,neutral
"The context within which the project operated changed significantly in the course of 2009. Early in the year, there was a shift away from the model of rapid onward transfer, and at the time of the evaluation mission, a new government policy of enhanced cooperation with the Libyan authorities on preventing irregular departures, together with the interception of boats outside Italian territorial waters and the return of those on board to Libya, had resulted in a sharp drop in the number of arrivals in Sicily and Lampedusa. A more restrictive approach was also adopted in relation to the disembarkation of those rescued at sea in Italy",neutral
"Only a limited number of the refugees can expect to be accepted for resettlement, and yet those who remain in the three countries of asylum have almost no prospect of 2 local integration or gaining secure residency rights, both of which have been effectively ruled out by the authorities.",neutral
KEY FINDINGS: Effectiveness and impact.,neutral
Strengthening resilience to shocks.,neutral
"This study has found that PoC face high levels of shocks and stressors, inhibiting their livelihood development and progress toward self-reliance. On average, PoC in urban areas have faced 2.9 different types of shocks or stressors (out of five) in the past five years, and camp-based PoC have faced an average of 3.4 (out of five). The most common types of stressors facing PoC are economic/political shocks and protection shocks",neutral
A resilience approach is important to support PoC to not lose gains made from participating in livelihoods programmes when faced with shocks.,neutral
"Considering the dynamic contexts and high level of shocks UNHCR is operating in, a resilience strategy helps programmes pivot from humanitarian to development approaches in areas with protracted crises and chronic stressors. For example, UNHCR may support livelihood beneficiaries with cash transfers in the midst of a shock to prevent distress sales of their productive assets until regular livelihood programming can resume",neutral
External factors affecting results.,neutral
Strengthening monitoring systems to measure impact and resilience.,neutral
"Recognizing these challenges with the Focus Data, it is important that UNHCR began monitoring livelihoods outside of Focus through the revised monitoring indicators. These indicators provide crucial evidence to the organization on achievements beyond output level indicators",neutral
"UNHCR first released the Minimum Criteria for Livelihoods Programming in February 2015 to bring greater accountability and quality assurance in livelihoods programming, but has recognized the need to shift and adapt these guidelines since their initiation.",neutral
"Recognizing this, many operations are shifting to development-oriented and systems-level approaches. Joint programming with United Nations agencies and other development, government, and private sector actors appears to be growing among operations. The ET finds there is opportunity for learning from and expanding these partnerships. UNHCR has an important role to play as a convener of the livelihoods sector coordination as it relates to refugees. It is critical that UNHCR is at the table in conversations that involve the humanitarian-development nexus and refugee contexts because UNHCR knows refugees. UNHCR should be part of the conversation not only about refugee protection but also about refugee livelihoods and economic inclusion.",neutral
"Given that most UNHCR programmes are operating in contexts of protracted displacement, shocks will be a mainstay of the operational context, which is why a resilience framework is key.",neutral
"TANGO recognizes that a fundamental question for the livelihood strategy moving forward is not only how to do livelihoods, but if UNHCR should do livelihoods. The ET concludes that yes, UNHCR should be involved in livelihoods, but in a strategic role",neutral
"In all, these roles build the foundation of refugee access to basic services and systems on which economic and development activities will depend.",neutral

"owever, UNHCR should be ensuring the protection aspects are included by the partners who take on these activities. UNHCR can build bridges with development organizations and private or financial sector partners, giving them ‘access’ to refugees and data while continuing with the protection focus.

"For UNHCR, the issue of involving development actors in the search for durable solutions for persons displaced by conflict, namely refugees, has a long history stretching back to the early 1980s, in particular the International Conference on Assistance to Refugees in Africa (ICARA) in 1984. More recently, especially after the UN Humanitarian Response Review of 2005, internally displaced persons have also become a regular, though distinct, feature of the search for durable solution. In addition, since late 2008, protracted refugee situations have become a focus of attention in the work of UNHCR, not only in terms of durable solutions, but also in promoting, with the help of development actors, a degree of self-reliance through livelihood activities. An overview of UNHCR’s initiatives to involve development actors from their beginnings up to the Brookings Roundtable in 1999 was the subject of a UNHCR study in 2001. This present paper complements that work by studying the same subject during the period 2001- 2012. The integration/reintegration of conflict-affected populations in their country of origin is recognized as one of the more important aspects of the transition from relief to development and as an integral part of peacebuilding.",neutral

The unanticipated emergency generated a massive influx of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in Tunisia and Egypt, two countries which themselves had only recently experienced major political upheavals. As a result of these considerations, little contingency planning had taken place. In the first few weeks of the emergency, the majority of the new arrivals were third-country nationals, that is, citizens of neither Libya nor the countries to which they moved. Altogether, more than 120 nationalities were represented in the exodus, not to mention hundreds of thousands of Libyans who enjoyed de facto temporary protection on Egyptian and Tunisian soil, as well as access to public services.",neutral
"The border camps established in Tunisia and Egypt to accommodate the new arrivals presented UNHCR with the challenge of having to deal with a very diverse group of people in terms of both their nationality and their legal status. The migrant workers, asylum seekers, rejected asylum seekers and recognized refugees who took up residence in the camps had some common humanitarian needs, but their protection needs and ability to find durable solutions differed significantly.",neutral

"By any standards the scale of the refugee influx in a relatively short period of time in Dollo Ado, with 24,000 arriving in one month alone was very challenging. By all accounts the refugees arrived “at death’s door” in an extremely harsh environment where scorching heat, arid and rocky grounds, limited fauna and strong winds made surviving challenging in any circumstances. The existing refugee camps were full to capacity by the first months of 2011 and costly operations needed to be undertaken to establish the third, then forth and then fifth camps. These new camps had to be constructed within a short period of time",neutral
The refugee population was entirely dependent on food aid and by October 2011 the food collected from the general food distribution lasted for an average of just 23.5 days,neutral
"In fact, the most common source of cash income was reported to be the sale of food aid.",neutral
By March 2011 the annual UNHCR planning figures for new arrivals had been exceeded in just three months. Preliminary findings from a nutrition survey carried out in late March “indicated that the nutritional status of the refugees require urgent intervention”5.,neutral
"The transit centre space was designed for 3,900 individuals for a maximum of 3 days however starting from the end of April 2011, the transit centre population exceeded the intended capacity and it remained over capacity for the next 8 months7.

"ey call upon UNHCR to develop a level of strategic thinking and planning that, while uncommon in many international public sector organisations, benefits from over 50 years of academic research and practice. None of the strategic planning approaches that UNHCR may consider are new. There are a range of techniques and models that can be used in complex, humanitarian crises. In addition to strategy, the Evaluation calls upon UNHCR to move away from the budget-based financial management—again common in public sector organisations but out-dated elsewhere—and towards reflective, adaptive and strategic financial management to ensure that money is used for what works best. It calls upon UNHCR to hone and strengthen its coordination skills, ensuring a balance between directive and consultative approaches, while committing all to a strict focus on short- and medium-term strategic objectives. It calls upon all of these in direct relation to UNHCR’s responsibility to ensure refugees’ protection and assistance needs, amongst issues directly related to the refugees who so desperately need UNHCR’s help. These do not fit tidily into clearly actionable recommendations. This approach requires organisation-wide changes, in some cases, and a shift in the way people conceive of their roles and responsibilities in a humanitarian organisation. The response demands it. The refugees demand it. The international community that looks to UNHCR’s leadership on behalf of refugees demands it. If not now, when?",neutral

It implied a change from a model in which UNHCR's work was divided between two somewhat distinct sectors: those of ""Assistance"" and ""Protection"", to an understanding that Protection itself has material, social, economic, political and legal dimensions. The AGDM strategy highlights the importance of focusing not only on the legal aspects of protection, but also the social and, economic aspects, as these are the spheres in which most rights violations of persons of concern occur.",neutral

III. Findings,neutral
"The response to the sudden influx of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya into Bangladesh in August 2017 has been complex and challenging. The generosity of the Bangladesh Government and people, who have treated this population as refugees and made available land and resources to give them safety and sanctuary, should be praised at the outset of this evaluation.",neutral
"The next phase will be equally challenging, albeit in a different way. UNHCR now needs to make sure it has the right leadership, strategy and expertise to supportthe Government to find solutions and to assume policy leadership to ensure the refugees’ ongoing protection.",neutral
"This outcome was not guaranteed. There were multiple risk factors at play at the beginning of the crisis. The refugees had been walking for several days, fleeing trauma and violence, and were in poor shape on arrival. Even before their flight the health of this population was poor, with some of the highest malnutrition rates and lowest vaccination rates to be found in Myanmar, South East Asia’s poorest country. In 1978, 10,000 people died in the camps because of poor public health; cholera in particular is a major risk in such large camp situations. Other mass movements of refugees in the past decades have seen mass casualties from diseases such as measles, and the diphtheria outbreak in November 2017 could have killed many more people had swift action not been taken.",neutral
"A Prime Ministerial directive in mid-September enabled UNHCR to work at scale throughout the affected region. On 12 September, the first two aid flights each carrying 91 metric tonnes of core relief items took off and on 19 September, the first distribution of hygiene kits (to 1,900 people) took place.",neutral
"The protection of refugees is UNHCR’s core mandate. In practice, this translates to undertaking activities aimed at obtaining full respect for the rights of individuals, in accordance with international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law. Humanitarian action should also support community-based protection mechanisms, in line with the principles of partnership and accountability.",neutral
"UNHCR’s ability to offer protection to refugees in accordance with its mandate for this response is correlated with the overall coordination structure that was in place prior to the August 2017 influx, and as it evolved in the first year. As a result, it should be examined together with the findings in the next section. Prior to the August 2017 influx, the Government of Bangladesh had been reluctant to grant refugee status to the Rohingya population outside of two registered camps, classifying them as Undocumented Myanmar Nationals (UMNs). IOM had been in the lead outside these small registered camps, which covered only around 34,000 refugees, and in the early days this arrangement continued. UNHCR was initially not favoured as the Government was reluctant to designate this influx as a refugee crisis.",neutral
"curing these identification cards for the Rohingya required considerable tenacity, skills and tactical acumen. Unfortunately, its launch coincided with the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between UNHCR, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of Myanmar, the contents of which have not been made public, leading to suspicion among the Rohingya refugees as to the true purpose for the registration, and concurrently, a slow uptake.",neutral
"Many of the agencies in the refugee response do not have refugee protection expertise or backgrounds in protection, and mainstreaming protection seems rather abstract.",neutral
"Already some refugees reportedly resort to hazardous and exploitative illegal work to get by, including within the drugs trade and the sex industry. Domestic violence, child marriage and polygamy have emerged as significant problems during the period of encampment. There are also unconfirmed rumours of organized violence by some groups.",neutral
"The scale of these problems is unknown given limited security at night, no access to justice, a culture of impunity and cultural barriers. As the situation continues to stagnate, securing rights and preventing exploitation and violence will become increasingly important but also challenging. The refugee situation will likely grow more complex as long as solutions remain elusive. If any restrictive policies are adopted, it may make preventing exploitation and other abuses within the refugee community more challenging.",neutral
"Coordination for the Rohingya refugee response has been complex, evolving and a reflection of inter-agency dynamics and Government of Bangladesh policies and priorities. It can be examined at three different levels:",neutral
"at the Dhaka level, the Cox’s Bazar level, and the camp level. In Dhaka, a tripartite Strategic Executive Group (SEG) leads the international response, and is jointly led by the Resident Coordinator, UNHCR and IOM. At the national level, the Government has led through the National Task Force established for Rohingya migration and headed by the Foreign Secretary. Currently, operational humanitarian coordination for the Rohingya refugee response is undertaken through the Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) at the level of Cox’s Bazar, reporting to the SEG. In Cox’s Bazar the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner has led the response, with the Deputy Commissioner also responsible for major areas",neutral
"In the camps, a government official called ‘Camp-in-Charge’ (CiC) has been appointed. In terms of the international response, a different coordination approach exists, with roughly half the population living in camps managed by IOM and the other half living in camps managed by UNHCR based on a geographic division of responsibility.",neutral
"The ISCG was initially led by IOM and in place prior to the August 2017 influx through Government directives provided between 2013 and 2017. The ISCG was established to lead operational humanitarian coordination at the level of Cox’s Bazar, including facilitating the work of sectoral technical groups. With the pace and scale of the influx in the initial months, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) staff were seconded to the coordination efforts associated with the response, with an OCHA- deployed Senior Coordinator at the Cox’s Bazar level reporting to IOM and then to the Resident Coordinator. Starting in January 2018, the tripartite SEG structure was functional in Dhaka, and the Senior Coordinator, seconded by UNHCR, headed an ISCG Secretariat in Cox’s Bazar. This Secretariat was expanded to include staff from various agencies, and sectoral technical groups were further strengthened, headed by UN agencies and co-led by NGOs. Protection was constructed as a technical sector with UNHCR in the lead, and included two sub-sectors, one on gender-based violence led by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the other for child protection led by UNICEF",neutral
A coordination review to examine how the current system can be improved and streamlined was commissioned in September 2018. 5 The outcome of this review was still pending as this evaluation was finalized,neutral

"The context in the country of asylum is challenging, given that the Rohingya are increasingly unpopular locally as a result of labour competition, environmental destruction and perceived criminality. Nationally, there is a fear that development resources will be diverted to refugee welfare. Myanmar has not yet created the conditionsthat UNHCR believes to be conducive for return. Faced with this Hobson’s choice, the Government of Bangladesh is open to creative solutions, but it rightly sees Myanmar as the party that should provide these solutions.",neutral
"The current situation presents an opportunity for dialogue, and especially for UNHCR expertise, but with a lack of consistent leadership in Dhaka in the first year of the response and an already strong and exclusive bilateral approach by the two governments, this has not yet happened.",neutral

"As this evaluation was being finalized, the first attempt by the Government of Bangladesh to start the repatriation process was taking place. In line with their MoU, UNHCR agreed to interview refugees in order to ascertain their intent to return or not at this time, but not to facilitate this return because UNHCR did not believe conditions were conducive.",neutral
"The organization will need to continue explaining its position to concerned stakeholders, to dialogue and advocate with the Government, and to build allies within the strong local NGO community.",neutral
"It is nothing short of remarkable that Bangladesh and its international partners have managed to give refuge to almost a million Rohingya refugees without mass casualties from epidemic or natural hazards. The fact that the condition of the more than 730,000 people who fled extreme violence since August 2017 has gradually stabilized is even more remarkable given the challenges posed to this response by the limited land, the risks of natural disasters, and the difficult terrain",neutral
"Government commitment has been made to not forcibly return the refugees. These protection achievements have taken longer and are less thorough than if UNHCR had been in the lead, or in a stronger leadership position.",neutral
"The history of the Rohingya is one of extreme suffering and precariousness. For the last half a century, they have been pushed backwards and forwards across the Myanmar–Bangladesh border, denied rights, and living a cowed and perilous existence. This cycle of violence, expulsion and persecution will continue without a solution.",neutral
"UNHCR has a significant role to play in determining that solution and the international community must continue to do everything it can to work with both governments to find an acceptable future for the Rohingya. This means sticking to principles but speaking determinedly and forcefully for the rights of refugees, and acceptable international standards surrounding solutions",neutral
"UNHCR should lend its expertise, at the peril of entering a challenging political arena, to press for sustainable return in Rakhine State, and resolution of the question of citizenship for Rohingya people. It is ultimately the regional and international powers that will be decisive though; it will be their interventions with the Government of Myanmar that will enable progress on a just solution. UNHCR must use all its artistry on behalf of this population to ensure the cycle of history is not continued",neutral
"The ETCs offer a mechanism to UNHCR to provide a safe environment for refugees pending resettlement processing, including those classified under emergency or urgent priority, and to realize the durable solution of resettlement.",neutral
"the evaluation period from the beginning of 2012 until 30 September, 2015 a total of 1,568 refugees were resettled through the two ETCs. The life-saving 2 dimension in compelling protection cases is seen as vital even if there are very few emergency cases. ",neutral
"The centre in Humenné has gradually expanded into one which solely caters to US-government processing, while only Timisoara has received emergency cases due to the shorter Romanian government clearance, and the absence of visa requirements. For the ETC-hosting governments, Romania and the Slovak Republic, the centres provided an opportunity to show their solidarity with countries hosting large refugee case-loads, while neither providing a permanent home to larger groups of refugees nor carrying all the operational costs of these centres.",neutral
"While the coverage of the ETCs is in principle global, only refugees of some nationalities and countries of first asylum have been accommodated in the centres. Ad hoc planning and the obstacles experienced by some resettlement countries in the process of adjudication or completion of resettlement procedures, including selecting municipalities, has generally driven the use of ETCs. Most of the refugees transferred to the ETCs were resettled to the USA or the UK.",neutral
"As the host countries’ contributions are different in each of the ETCs, the contribution of UNHCR also differs, the biggest difference being that UNHCR pays the food costs in Timisoara, which amounted to between 40-49% of total expenditures in the period 2012-2014. The overall expenditures for Timisoara, excluding food costs ranged from USD 621,700 in 2012, USD 654,900 in 2013 to USD 657,000 in 2014. If food costs are included, the annual costs are USD 1,031,000 in 2012, USD 1,278,100 in 2013, USD 1,195,800 in 2014 and USD 1,157,000 in 2015. The ETC requires 51% (2015) to 60% (2012, 2013) of the total budget for the Romania operation. The overall expenditure for Humenné was USD 406,700 in 2012, USD 747,800 in 2013, USD 979,900 in 2014, and USD 666,700 in 2015 (first 11 months).",neutral
"The average daily occupancy rate for Timisoara is between one third to one half, and for Humenné approximately half of its capacity. Considering the nature of emergency case handling, and the flexibility this requires, the ETCs must always have space available to receive cases with serious protection needs.",neutral
he overwhelming majority of refugees stay an average of four to five months. Capacity has generally been viewed in terms of the available number of beds instead of in relation to site and shelter space available.,neutral
These standards should be based for example on the Sphere minimum humanitarian standards for shelter and non-food items.1 The standards should also take into account the objectives of preparing refugees for life in a resettlement country.,neutral
"The Romanian government has received funds from the EU to upgrade an existing facility to house the ETC. Work is expected to begin in 2016 so that refugees could be accommodated in 2017. It is imperative that UNHCR seize the opportunity to be involved at the planning stage of this process in order to ensure that the physical set-up is conducive to providing adequate assistance and protection, and to preparing refugees for resettlement. Some input into planning would also allow cost-savings if, for example, kitchens were included so that refugees could cook for themselves.",neutral
"The utilization of the ETCs has also been viewed in connection with the selection of refugees, and the process of obtaining clearances and organizing the transfer to one of the centres. The ETCs are directly linked to UNHCR’s global resettlement operation through the ETC focal point in the Resettlement Service, UNHCR headquarters. UNHCR Field Offices and Regional Resettlement Hubs are vital in identifying refugees for whom transfer to the ETC is an appropriate solution.",neutral
There are some differences in the provision of protection and assistance in the two ETCs.,neutral
Article 2 (2) of the Tri-Partite Agreement states that refugees “shall be required to reside in the ETC facility designated by the Romanian government.”,neutral
Resettlement is by definition a partnership activity.,neutral
Only the centre in Timisoara was used for emergency priority cases in 2013 and 2014. An overall reduction of this function is visible during the period 2012-2015,neutral
"The majority of refugees were transferred to the ETCs to support either the processing of resettlement cases by means of interviews, biometrics or to find municipalities in the resettlement country.",neutral
"Moreover, as a tangible form of responsibility-sharing, the centres have given Romania and the Slovak Republic the opportunity to present their contribution to the international protection regime in international fora. Romania established a resettlement programme with a quota of 40 refugees per year, with the first group of 38 refugees arriving in 2010, and the second group in 2014. The Slovak Republic also pledged, on a voluntary basis, 100 resettlement places in the period 2015-2017 towards the Council of the European Conclusions on Resettlement of 20 July 2015.",neutral
"Given the current situation in Europe it could be argued that more responsibility-sharing could be expected, and the existence of the ETCs should not absolve these governments of the obligation to provide durable solutions to a greater number of refugees. The host governments might also be persuaded to contribute more resources to the running of the ETCs.",neutral
"n conclusion, the evolution in the operation of the ETCs shows a move away from their original vision. In the words of one interlocutor “there is nothing emergency about this process.” This has resulted in a situation whereby the policies and practices of resettlement countries to a large extent actually determine the use of the ETCs. Internal factors further impact upon the efficiency and effectiveness of the centres. Thus, replacing the first word of the acronym “ETC” with resettlement (“Resettlement Transit Centres”) would actually give a clearer indication of the main purpose of these centres, namely to support the realization of this durable solution. This could then also cover possible shifts or changes in their functions as RTCs continue to respond to the needs of different stakeholders. The sustainability of these centres must also be viewed in relation to UNHCR’s responsibility to manage the “pipeline” in cooperation with resettlement states.",neutral
