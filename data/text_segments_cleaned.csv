1740,There are several reasons for this: a professional and cultural divide between the development staff implementing programmes and the lawyers in the NORMES Department with weak incentives to work together more coherently; an almost total preoccupation in terms of work load with the supervisory system by staff in the NORMES Department; difficulties by staff in other technical areas in understanding the legal processes of ILS; and continued difficulties (in some programme areas more than others) in integrating ILS into Technical Cooperation.,negative,True

11273,The formulation of a responsible transition strategy with policies and additional tools should enable UNHCR to strengthen its support and help States to meet the challenges involved in individual RSD.,neutral,True
11274,Political willingness is on the other hand not a safeguard for correct RSD decision-making in compliance with international norms.,neutral,True
11275,The review recommends (1) the identification of a limited set of global indicators for continued mandate RSD to capture these situations.,neutral,True
11277,"These foundations require a much longer perspective and should fit in agendas for development, good governance and the rule of law.",neutral,True
11280,Especially in the area of independent appeals and legal assistance international standards and practice have evolved.,neutral,True
11282,"Much will depend on the wishes of the government, possible protection gaps, the risk of national structures becoming overwhelmed from the start, and standards of fairness.",neutral,True

11291,"The answers to the questionnaire and additional research have resulted in a historical graph, which is contained in annex III to the report.",neutral,True
11293,"Ultimately, the political willingness to invest in an adequate system and the humanitarian spirit with which it is operated will be decisive for the proper identification of refugees.",neutral,True
11296,"In addition, it is proposed (vi) to complement the findings with a more strategic inquiry into recent alternative, protection sensitive strategies which have helped to relieve pressures on individual RSD systems.",neutral,True

11325,"In order to achieve an efficient and sustainable national RSD system, as part of an effective refugee protection framework in Kenya more broadly, it is imperative that the political will on the part of the authorities to take charge of registration and refugee status determination is translated into a commitment to allocate sufficient and sustained resources (both human and financial) in the coming years.",neutral,True

11350,"Key components of such a strategy could be advocacy for refugees to increase their access to the formal labour market inter alia by gaining access to formal vocational training, to regularise informal work, and to permit refugees to re-register where they are currently living and working (but without access to social services that are tied to their province of registration).",neutral,True

11541,The issue is also raised in the recent IASC-sponsored Cluster Approach Evaluation Phase 2.,neutral,True
11542,A Cluster Lead has to ensure that all facets of protection are covered in a coherent fashion in any given situation; this approach to protection is more than the sum of the contributions of participating agencies working in a particular Cluster- coordinated operation.,neutral,True

11554,The protection needs that present themselves in a natural disaster situation are not dissimilar to those found in refugee or IDP conflict-related situations: risk of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) due to overcrowding in evacuation centres; unequal access to relief; unaccompanied and separated children; lack of a system to identify and assist persons with special needs; limited information and consultation of communities on relief and rehabilitation measures; loss of personal identification documents; loss of housing and land for irregular slum dwellers with no avenues for compensation.,neutral,True

11854,"Moreover, these projects did not collaborate with larger programmes on related issues.",negative,True
11855,"As a result, some of the achievements (e.g. strategic plans and policies developed) were isolated and disconnected from the programme as a whole.",negative,True
11856,"This was especially the case for field-oriented programmes, such as cattle production, watershed management and home-based nurseries, where the activities were developed around community organizations.",negative,True

11861,"With the private sector playing a significant role in financing the 2030 development agenda, FAO will also need to step up its private-sector engagement.",negative,True
11862,The main shortcoming affecting the relevance of the projects evaluated was the decision to fund a large number of projects through two different funding windows at the same time.,negative,True
11863,"This contributed to atomized funding, increased the risk of overlaps and affected the possibility of building mutually reinforcing synergies.",negative,True
11864,"Furthermore, the vast majority of immediate action projects did not monitor the adaptability and productivity performance of PGRFA.",negative,True

11872,"In the majority of cases observed (handicrafts, dyeing of wool, etc.), the indications are that the beneficiaries still require training on topics such as quality control and the sale and marketing of their products and services",negative,True
11873,"In particular, the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources was mainly focused on the harvesting of water resources in the upper paramo basins and sub-basins and the optimization of their use, the application of a pilot model of compensation mechanisms for the Payment for Environmental Services (PSA).",negative,True
11874,"In contrast, the conservation of biodiversity and agrobiodiversity in the paramos was much less evident, partly because there was not enough awareness and recognition of their use and function.",negative,True
11875,"Consequently, for example, it was observed that adaptation to climate change using local resistant crops in order to consolidate the food sovereignty and security of the communities involved in accordance with project objectives and the current legal framework (particularly the Law on Agrobiodiversity and Seeds) was not promoted.",negative,True
11876,FAO therefore needs to more loudly share lessons from pilot projects and from its experience and expertise.,negative,True
11877,"This requires a centralized monitoring and evaluation function, better knowledge management and outreach to make sure the lessons learned from TCPs and pilots are integrated into larger donor-funded projects, even if they will not be implemented by FAO.",negative,True
11878,The Technical Working Group for Agriculture and Water (for which FAO is the lead development partner facilitator) could perhaps be utilized more for this purpose.,negative,True

11886,"However, the design was not well balanced to ensure the adoption of a multisectoral approach in all JRP villages and throughout the duration of the project: the WASH component covered a limited number of villages in a single locality.",negative,True
11887,A dramatic increase in the number of villages to correct an initial wrong estimate of the population catchment led to a postponement of food security and livelihood activities in about half the targeted villages.,negative,True
11888,This reduced the integrated dimension of JRP and compromised the quality of some interventions.,negative,True
11889,"Moreover, some Output 4 and 5 activities were monitored as a package through aggregated indicators that could not provide quantifiable evidence of what exactly was implemented.",negative,True
11890,Results and effects of activities that just started at the end of 2016 could not be measured through the last follow-up survey in 2016.,negative,True
11891,These are weak points of the M&E system that constrained the assessment of the scope and effects of the intervention.,negative,True
11892,The revision of the CAP by technical experts reduced potential ownership and buy-in of the process by the communities.,negative,True
11893,"However, targets had been discussed at the initial stage, so the CAP created expectations which could in turn generate frustration if targets were laterconsidered not to have been achieved by communities.",negative,True
11894,This provides lessons on the involvement of communities in the design of future community-based resilience intervention (see Recommendation 3).,negative,True

11896,"As far as possible, multisectoral programme should address the issue of national institutional mechanisms to implement a multisectoral approach.",negative,True
11897,"WASH components raised an issue of sustainability, considering there was no effective water management committee, no fees were systematically collected for most water sources and locality services were weak.",negative,True
11898,"A clear strategy to ensure some sustainability, relying on investment of the communities and included in the CAP should have been defined at design stage.",negative,True

11900,"The choice of villages should have been documented in detail to clarify the various criteria used to select villages, the decision-making process and the roles of different actors involved.",negative,True
11901,There was also a lack of clarity regarding the way project resources were shared between the 75 villages.,negative,True
11902,"The selection of beneficiaries was left to the to the VDCs who have their own perception of equity, in practice often centred exclusively on balancing support to different tribal components of the community.",negative,True

11904,"An obvious concentration of benefits towards certain individuals who did not necessarily belong to the most vulnerable segments of the population appeared as a risk, besides countering the stated JRP goal of reducing vulnerability.",negative,True
11905,"Effectiveness at global level suffers from the lack of agreed managerial processes in the Management Committee (MC), limited resources, lack of staff, a lack of implementation of strategic planning and limited review of progress and activities being undertaken.",negative,True
11906,The MC and the GSC are critical for the functioning of GF-TADs at global and regional level.,negative,True

11911,Multi-phased programme is needed in the areas requiring a long-term holistic capacity development while Training of Trainers helped utilize small training budgets effectively.,negative,True
11912,Plans to hand over the field-tested prototype technology to the private sector for commercial distribution was underway as an exit strategy.,negative,True
11913,A confounding finding (from analysis of CASU monitoring data) is that the amount of land put under legumes with conventional practices increased during the project period.,negative,True
11914,"Hence, while the overall proportion of land used for CA cultivation of maize increased, the CA production of legumes decreased in comparison to the land farmed using conventional farming (CF) for legume production.2",negative,True
11915,The late start-up of the activity meant that there was insufficient time to remedy these problems.,negative,True
11916,This reflects the difficulties encountered throughout the region in identifying practical and sustainable mechanization solutions and finance solutions for small-scale farmers.,negative,True
11917,The monitoring data has indicated that there has been considerable variation of application of CA techniques year to year and between crops.,negative,True

11922,"In particular, it can be observed that INIAP did not manage to pledge all of the cofinancing intended, particularly since 2016 due to budget restrictions and political changes that reduced its role in agricultural extension, particularly with regard to the transfer of technology.",negative,True
11923,"It was also difficult to sign the LoA with the Heifer Foundation that, on the one hand, could not take on the role of service provider without prior training by FAO-EC and, on the other hand, continued in the Steering Committee subsequent to the decision to apply the DIM by FAO-EC which, in effect, resulted in the Foundation playing the role of both judge and defendant when it came to decision-making.",negative,True
11924,"In addition, the internal monitoring system and the management of risks did not contribute to improving the efficiency of planning and implementation.",negative,True
11925,"On the one hand, the monitoring and management of risks were focused on pursuing targets to fulfil the bureaucratic needs of the GEF and FAO.",negative,True

12288,"At the time of project approval, a significant number of projects had mobilized none, or very small proportions, of the required project funds.",negative,True
12289,The single most important deficiency is the absence of any quantification of Environment Fund financial or staff resources that will be required for project implementation.,negative,True
12290,This deficiency is because the UN accounting systems (IMIS) cannot handle allocating Environment Fund (EF) resources to projects.,negative,True
12291,The idea of allocating EF in projects was part of the original plan but had to be abandoned.,negative,True
12292,"Replication of project results is most often expected to happen simply through communication and awareness raising (websites, policy briefs, lessons learned papers etc.).",negative,True

12323,"Also, the lack of staff funded by reliable sources (both extra-budgetary funding and Environment Fund funding appear unreliable) has meant relatively high rates of fluctuation of team sizes and turnover in some units, many of whom have lost more than half their original number since 2010.",negative,True

12370,"Generally, the projects do not include baseline studies mainly because there is no funding for project design.",negative,True
12371,The reports reviewed for this evaluation show that Sub-programme performance reporting is done mostly at the output level because output monitoring was an easier task and the achievement of outputs became a proxy for the achievement of EAs.,negative,True

13490,"For many, it is a key that enables them to access the labour market, escape from poverty and gives them the opportunity to adapt to a changing world.",neutral,True
13491,Skills development is a fundamental enabler of decent work.,neutral,True
13492,"For example, work in national training system reform is hard to compare with projects that build skills to improve livelihoods in rural communities.",neutral,True
13493,"Moreover, success in one type of work in one country might be counter-balanced by relative failure in a similar field in another.",neutral,True
13494,"It draws on interdepartmental and inter-sectoral initiatives, field and headquarters collaboration, the involvement of constituents, and the development of external partnerships.",neutral,True

13515,The approach can only partially align with the current P&B strategies during a given biennium.,neutral,True
13516,"Nonetheless, independent project evaluation findings provide useful insights into where and how the ILO has performed, and also help to answer the critical question of why.",neutral,True
13517,"If repeated, the methodology could support systematic reporting of such performance results each biennium.",neutral,True
13518,Major disruptions occurred in the economies of countries evaluated during the 2001-2010 decade in which the nine DWCPs were evaluated.,neutral,True
13519,"In particular, Argentina faced an economic crisis; Indonesia faced a major earthquake and tsunami; and Honduras faced intensive political upheaval.",neutral,True
13520,All countries were affected by the financial crisis occurring in the later part of the decade.,neutral,True
13521,"When addressing Decent Work challenges, they should be periodically reviewed to ensure they adequately reflect the needs and priorities of the countries concerned.",neutral,True

13523,ILO began conducting Country Program Reviews (CPR) in 2008.,neutral,True
13524,"In the light of this report's findings, it is recommended that increased attention be given to CPRs with a view ensuring relevant lessons learnt from this meta-analysis are taken on board - such as constituent engagement, changes to relevance and coherence, efficiency, effectiveness and potential sustainability.",neutral,True
13525,"The challenges faced in some countries, such as Honduras, present considerable risks in the achievement of DWCP objectives.",neutral,True
13526,"The Honduras DWCP evaluation called for a risk mitigation strategy to be included in the DWCP, particularly in relation to political and economic risks.",neutral,True
13527,"Primarily the project sought to make linkages in sending and receiving countries, and amongst various stakeholders within countries, but linking to a global rights agenda.",neutral,True

13531,"Research commissioned examined the different needs of MDWs throughout the migration cycle (pre- employment, at work, and on return).",neutral,True
13532,"Reviewing the 11 baseline and five thematic studies; the 7 policy briefs and the labour force study conducted (in Zimbabwe, with one ready to go in Nepal), the Global Flagship on MDW summarises many of the key lessons learned on the rights of migrant domestic workers through the GAP-MDW project.",neutral,True
13533,The need for a focus on MDWs themselves has been fully recognised as the most sustainable approach for collective action to build advocacy approaches.,neutral,True
13534,Organising domestic workers is no easy task and requires further support.,neutral,True
13535,The project curates the cleaned SWTS micro data from all of the country surveys as they are completed.,neutral,True
13536,Access to these data sources is provided upon request and is accompanied by the instruments.,neutral,True
13537,Two research symposia were organized to encourage use of SWTS data in research.,neutral,True

13539,In eight countries an employer survey accompanied the first round of SWTS.,neutral,True
13540,"When assessing impact at the country level, it cannot be overemphasized that the evaluation team is drawing on the experiences of six (out of 34) countries.",neutral,True
13541,"As is the case for global impact, much of the potential country level impact of W4Y in terms of supporting improved policy and programme responses is yet unrealized.",neutral,True
13542,"Criteria for identifying the countries where the potential for impact would be greater would include: how recent was the latest survey completed, the existence of a relevant policy process to support and analytical capacity (or opportunity to develop capacity) of key stakeholders.",neutral,True
13543,These complementary investments would improve the value for money of W4Y.,neutral,True
13544,"The extent to which this is possible is, however, influenced by the limited amount of financial and other resources allocated by the different stakeholders.",neutral,True
13545,National policies thus need to be linked to concrete planning on implementation and strategies for resource allocation.,neutral,True
13546,HIV strategies is uncertain.,neutral,True
13547,"Donors are increasingly funding at country level, and to some extent through joint UN strategies.",neutral,True
13548,"Due to resource constraints and the disparate needs of countries, the ILO can prioritise its focus on countries meeting criteria such as high HIV prevalence, high overall numbers of people affected by HIV, availability and commitment of local resources to addressing HIV through the world of work.",neutral,True
13549,Evidence suggests that this is already somewhat the case though coverage remains broad.,neutral,True
13550,Capacity development is most effective when organizations can review their overall strategy and assess the development needs that flow from it.,neutral,True
13551,Selectivity is required to avoid fragmentation and dilution of effort.,neutral,True
13552,High-level evaluations include ratings for each of the evaluation criteria.,neutral,True
13553,Their purpose is to highlight areas where the evaluations located strengths and weaknesses.,neutral,True
13554,"Limited financial resource data make it virtually impossible to assess the extent to which the Organization gives it overall priority: whether there is an increase or decrease over time, and where the strategic focus is in relation to the results framework.",neutral,True
13555,It appears that capacity-related outcomes and indicators attract a higher proportion of Regular Budget Supplementary Account (RBSA) funding (nine per cent as opposed to six per cent).,neutral,True
13556,"Concerning coherence and synergies, it was found that a more comprehensive strategic framework for Outcome 17 would permit better coordination among the different prongs of the strategy.",neutral,True
13557,This would provide clearer guidance for implementation at the country level.,neutral,True
13558,"Most IOM staff at Headquarters (HQ) that participated in the evaluation exercise reported IOM policies, frameworks, strategies, SOPs, programmes and fundraising efforts as promoting the MCOF as a reference tool for crisis management and post-crisis transition and recovery.",neutral,True
13559,Figure 1 provides an overview of the institutional and strategic relevance of the MCOF.,neutral,True
13560,"Three databases were developed by IOM Rome, the main one listing African communities and associations in Italy and used for promotional activities.",neutral,True
13561,"A second database records all the investment projects submitted by the African nationals interested in MIDA and a third, with a more restricted scope, was set up to create the MIDA Italy Club.",neutral,True
13562,"On the second area, the report notes the increasing interest in diasporas considered as agents of development through remittances and investments in countries of origin.",neutral,True
13563,"An effective implementation of programmes in that area also requires an appropriate assessment of the diasporas, of their capacity to invest, and of the investment climate and opportunities in the country of origin.",neutral,True
13564,"Concerning labour migration, the report suggests a continuing focus on the management of organized labour migration and to include a development component in activities when relevant, as is the case with the labour migration projects being implemented between Guatemala and Canada.",neutral,True
13565,But labour migration does not systematically require a strong link with development prospects; as the recently adopted strategy document says: The primary goal of IOM is to facilitate the orderly and humane management of international migration.,neutral,True
13566,The fourth area includes capacity building projects and researches where IOM has gained a recognized expertise.,neutral,True
13567,A new area that deserves special attention within MIDA is the active promotion of the inclusion of migration into the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers of developing countries.,neutral,True
13568,The evaluation strongly recommends increasing efforts at such levels of capacity building activities.,neutral,True
13569,"Reasons were not specified, except for a few cases, e.g. government changes affecting the entity in charge of the 1035-funded project and therefore its sustainability.",neutral,True
13570,"Contrary to outcome and impact, sustainability is not necessarily a major indicator for measuring the success of a project, even if it is a sign of positive achievement.",neutral,True
13571,"Regardless of what is decided, one of the key questions is that of how to replenish the Mechanism.",neutral,True
13572,"Any discussion on changing the nature of the Mechanism would also require an assessment of the relevance of the current criteria, in particular whether they must be strictly applied or based on a broad interpretation of Resolution No. 1229, taking into account the historical background and experiences of this initial phase.",neutral,True
13573,"There are other elements which could be considered by IOM such as developing a clear exit strategy and phase of transition for the communities, ensuring that all plans and communities fully understand who is responsible for tracking the implementation of the plans which may include strengthening the local DRM committees within each community.",neutral,True
13574,A summary of all key findings and recommendations is found in Section C.,neutral,True
13575,"For this reason, this Evaluation has explored the potential for Transition Management as an approach to help achieve these changes, since its concept and application have a strong focus on sustainability topics.",neutral,True
13576,This choice does not intend to exlude any other innovation approaches that can be relevant for the Sub-Programme.,neutral,True
13577,"These aspirational business models involving more disruptive innovation are likely to be met by resistance since they will also intend, in part, to disrupt business-as-usual strategies by governments and corporations.",neutral,True

13586,"The next upgrade of Umoja is scheduled for September 2018, (Umoja 2.0) and will integrate the administrative and financial features of the current Umoja system with the project information and management system.",neutral,True
13587,It is deemed important that all existing project data quickly become available in the new system.,neutral,True
13588,"It is also important that staff are adequately trained in a timely manner, both in the Headquarters as well as in the Paris and Geneva sites and in Regional Offices.",neutral,True

13590,"Core areas linked to delivery of the Convention and Protocols are Governance, Integrated Coastal Zone Management, Biodiversity, Pollution Prevention and Control.",neutral,True
13591,"If collections of project concepts were presented in an EA Framework this collaborative planning benefit could be retained, and the frameworks could be used as a design tool to strengthen the causal logic, and plan for greater synergy, among collections of projects in relation to the achievement of Expected Accomplishments.",neutral,True
13592,"The casual logic, upon which the PoW should be built, should be examined early in the MTS and PoW preparation process before higher results levels are formalized (and thereby fixed) in the broader UN work planning approvals process.",neutral,True
13593,The PoW planning documents specify a range of roles and responsibilities for Divisions in subprogramme implementation.,neutral,True
13594,"These responsibilities were defined in terms such as; Lead Division, Coordinating Division, Programme Framework Coordinating Division, PoW Output Managing Division and Project Level Managing Division.",neutral,True
13595,From a design perspective this seems overly complex.,neutral,True
13596,Leveraging of UNEP products and services could benefit from better tracking of uptake and leveraging of UNEP products across networks and by other development partners.,neutral,True
13597,"In addition, the nature and level of engagement required with stakeholders is dependent on a clear assessment of partner capacities, willingness, and expected roles.",neutral,True

13606,"Besides the GEF, the main donors for the CCSP are Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Spain and Italy.",neutral,True
13607,The evaluation reaches a number of conclusions and makes a series of recommendations to further enhance UNEP planning documents and processes with the goal of improving organisational performance.,neutral,True
13608,"Conscious that UNEP planning processes are already perceived as rather cumbersome and time-consuming, the proposed recommendations do not add additional requirements, procedures or processes but aim to strengthen those already in place.",neutral,True
13609,"There are generally fewer recommendations for the higher level planning processes and documents (MTS and PoWs), whilst more opportunities for improvement have been identified at the Programme Framework and Project Document level.",neutral,True
13610,It is at these latter levels that the greatest potential for improvement coincides with the highest likelihood of translation into improved UNEP strategic focus and operational performance.,neutral,True
13611,Human and financial resource needs estimates are presented in the PoWs for all elements of the work plan.,neutral,True
13612,"Human and financial resource needs were initially estimated by OfO for the corporate functions and the SPCs for each sub-programme, but the sub-programme allocations of the Environment Fund were re-negotiated by the Division Directors to avoid disruption of the existing resource allocation patterns.",neutral,True

13627,"C&W. The success of the Sub- programme in supporting countries to reach the desired transition to sound management of C&W (the intermediate state towards impact) depended, to a very large degree, on the extent to which the various dimensions of national capacity have been developed coupled with the presence of drivers and validity of assumptions made during sub-programme design.",neutral,True
13628,"As is the case in most of UNEP‘s activities, the degree to which the stated direct outcomes can be achieved in the targeted countries with the associated changes in state, corporate and individual behaviours determines how progress is being made towards impact.",neutral,True
13629,"A sustained effort in capacity building, information and awareness is likely to result in the attitudinal changes likely to promote higher level results.",neutral,True

13646,A coherent Subprogramme logic and framework with clear selection criteria for choice of projects would help better define and limit the EMSP to areas where it can be most effective and have most impact.,neutral,True
13647,"However, several project managers suggested that many projects will need to be continued in order to achieve intended impacts and will need additional support, particularly with regards to policy level activities.",neutral,True
13648,"On the other hand, projects should factor in adequate project scoping and inception phases to allow adaptations based on consultations with partners.",neutral,True
13649,"Another important issue raised was that some projects (including GEF projects) could only be modified to a limited extent following PRC advice as they had, sometimes, already been approved by donors prior to PRC review.",neutral,True
13650,"However, attention would need to be given to ensure that this did not cause fragmentation of projects into small components.",neutral,True
13651,An inception phase for activities such as hiring staff and negotiating partner agreements should be considered for larger or more complex (multi-partner) projects.,neutral,True
13652,"Many of the EMSP projects are complex combining normative work (such as technical guidelines and policy work) with field interventions (pilot or demonstration projects), operate at multiple geographical scales (e.g. local, national and regional), and/or involve large multi-stakeholder or intergovernmental processes.",neutral,True
13653,Components in larger projects are sometimes interdependent and sequential in nature.,neutral,True
13654,"The overall lead Division for the EMSP is DEPI, with other Divisions accountable for specified outputs in each of the two PoW periods.",neutral,True
13655,The day-to-day work of programme coordination was the responsibly of a sub- programme coordinator (SPC) reporting to the Division Director.,neutral,True
13656,"There were three EMSPCs during the evaluation period, typically supported by one administrative or junior professional officer.",neutral,True
13657,"A wide cross-section of interviewees indicated that earlier and more comprehensive involvement of ROs and linkage to UNEP regional assessments would result in design of a PoW that better responds to the needs of countries, and that joint planning and implementation arrangements need to be put in place.",neutral,True
13658,"There is a need for more clarity and agreement on modalities on how to develop, implement and resource the PoW through and with the ROs and the countries, and ROs need to be seen as part of the overall team.",neutral,True
13659,"ROs could also play a more important role at the country level, even taking over the coordination of the longer- term projects, as has happened with the Iraq Marshlands Project which is now managed by ROWA.",neutral,True
13660,"But for the ROs to run longer-term projects efficiently, their operational capacity, funding and delegated authority need to be improved.",neutral,True
13661,"The EMSP was the second largest recipient of EF amongst the Subprogrammes during 2010-2013 after the EGSP but only the fourth largest in terms of attracting extra-budgetary funding after the CCSP, EGSP and RESP.",neutral,True
13662,"Norway, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Netherlands and Japan have been the most significant donors of extra-budgetary funding to the EMSP (not listed in the order of significance).",neutral,True
13663,"During the period dovered by the MTS 2010-2013, 78% of the EMSP EF funds were allocated for posts and the remaining staff positions were funded through extra-budgetary and RB resources.",neutral,True
13664,"The MTE of the MTS recommended basing resource allocation on formally approved Divisional workplans, and allocating EF resources foremost to core functions of UNEP.",neutral,True
13665,These recommendations are further reinforced by the findings of this evaluation.,neutral,True
13666,"During 2010-2013, the actual EF budget was lower than that envisaged but financial resources received through Trust Funds and Earmarked Contributions were higher.",neutral,True
13667,"However, in general, EMSP projects were over optimistic when it came to their aims and budgets during the MTS 2010-2013.",neutral,True
13668,Improving reporting on linkages with relevant MEAs and how individual projects can help meet Aichi Targets as part of their 6-monthly reporting commitments would be desirable and help focus more attention on this issue.,neutral,True
13669,"Linkage and reporting related to MEA priorities will be strengthened to some extent through the new (draft) UNEP project document produced in September 2014, under the EGSP, which requires identification of any potential impacts or opportunities that could result from projects related to the development, implementation and advancement of MEAs.",neutral,True
13670,The entry point for UNEP has to some extent been opportunistic: to concentrate on those areas of governance where the greatest impact can be achieved.,neutral,True
13671,"Hence it has worked on policy dialogue, advocacy, exchange visits, training and providing some basic resources for key government departments, notably in the Ministry of Environment and Physical Development (MEFPD), the Ministry of Water Resources and Electricity (MWRE), the Forestry National Corporation (FNC) and the Higher Council for Environment and Natural Resources (HCNER).",neutral,True
13672,The financial climate and opportunities for new funding in Sudan will remain limited in the absence of a durable peace agreement in Darfur.,neutral,True
13673,"In relation to this, raising the ability (and expectations) of communities to seek funds directly rests on an assumption that the private sector will be able to respond to demands for inputs and environmental infrastructure and technology.",neutral,True
13674,This is far from realities at present.,neutral,True
13675,"No radical changes need to be made to core programme activities, but some resources within these should be redirected.",neutral,True
13676,"In particular, a more holistic integration of programmes in forestry and water is required.",neutral,True
13677,The cumulative benefits that lend themselves to conflict prevention would be better served if resources were concentrated in designated geographical areas.,neutral,True
13678,"The obvious unit would be the catchment area (such as Wadi El Ku), not least because UNEP has managed to leverage additional interest and funding for these.",neutral,True
13679,A measure of policy commitment and sustainability will be the leveraging of environmental funds from federal and state budgets.,neutral,True
13680,Ownership should then be demonstrated and reinforced with government strategy and budget lines assigned to sustaining these activities.,neutral,True
13681,What is the likelihood that the National Action Plan developed through the project will succeed in bridging the gap between Russia and developed countries in its overall prevention and control of mercury pollution?,neutral,True
13682,What are the key factors which need to be taken into account in achieving the desired impact?,neutral,True
13683,"Especially when this Project started in 2012, there was a strong interest to cooperate with the international community on the issue of mercury among key governmental stakeholders, NGOs, academia and the business sector.",neutral,True
13684,Continuation of GEF funding is seen by Project stakeholders as an important mechanism to enable this cooperation.,neutral,True
13685,"The SDGs have set the goal (8) to “Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.”",neutral,True
13686,"The Paris Agreement provides the world with increased thrust to achieve low carbon, climate-resilient and sustainable development while recognizing the need to enhance capacity-building worldwide and support collaborative research and development, and technology transfer to developing countries.",neutral,True
13687,"In order to demonstrate the extent of validity for the proposed theory of change, a series of lines of inquiry were developed.",neutral,True
13688,Their main purpose of these questions is to explore the effectiveness of CBI.,neutral,True
13689,How does the provision of UNHCR cash affect the overall expenditure patterns of Syrian refugees?,neutral,True
13690,"Specifically, do the expenditure patterns of recipients (versus non-recipients) evolve over time to favour a higher proportion of financial resources spent in health, education, savings and repaying debt?",neutral,True
13691,"Third, NSAAs for their part will sit at the negotiating table for a variety of reasons.",neutral,True
13692,The acquisition of legitimacy is almost invariably a key objective for cooperative NSAAs.,neutral,True
13693,"Fifth, relationships with NSAAs are invariably delicate, balancing questions of perception and trust, with the fluidity and volatility of complex operating environments.",neutral,True
13694,"While the host government and individual NSAAs may both hold the power to sever or obstruct UNHCR engagement, the organization itself is also constantly forced to re- evaluate the cost-benefit analysis of operating in areas outside state control.",neutral,True
13695,"Since then, UNHCR has promulgated a very different policy document on urban refugees.",neutral,True
13696,"The new policy is a marked reversal of the 1997 policy, a document that focused more on reducing assistance and security issues for urban refugees and less on protection.",neutral,True
13697,A return to New Delhi was especially interesting since the author of the new policy had been on the earlier evaluation team and noted that the earlier mission seeded many elements of the new policy.,neutral,True
13698,Two-thirds of the 2000 evaluation made explicit suggestions for amending the 1997 policy and laid considerable groundwork for the 2009 policy.,neutral,True
13699,"Thus, a return to New Delhi in January 2013 to evaluate the viability of the new, more progressive policy toward urban refugees and the applicability of the twelve protection strategies was perhaps an overdue analysis.",neutral,True
13700,Both the city and the refugee population have expanded in the intervening years.,neutral,True
13701,"Over this timespan, the refugees and asylum seekers diversified from an almost all Afghan demographic to now include people from Myanmar, Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Eritrea, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and other African, Middle Eastern and Eastern European countries.",neutral,True
13702,"Now, New Delhi is a bustling national capital with a beautiful new airport, elevated highways, and metro lines to keep people moving around its ballooning spaces.",neutral,True
13703,"In response to the juxtaposition of an economic boom and a persistently high poverty rate, India has spent billions of dollars on poverty alleviation schemes in the past decade.",neutral,True
13704,"Even though many Indians continue to be mired in poverty, the government provides access to health, education and potentially to selected poverty alleviation schemes to refugees.",neutral,True
13705,This is all the more significant since India is neither a signatory to the 1951 Convention nor does it have a national refugee law.,neutral,True
13706,"Moreover, India has recently agreed to allow mandate refugees to apply for long-term visas that would provide them with the legal right to work and access to all academic institutions.",neutral,True
13707,"Even so, many of the refugees in New Delhi would like to move on to a third country and recently the UNHCR Office has spent considerable resources in discouraging unrealistic aspirations for resettlement.",neutral,True
13708,It is gradually becoming clear to these refugees that India may not be a way-station but a destination.,neutral,True
13709,"And at this destination, refugees need to navigate how to live amongst the multitudes of the indigenous poor.",neutral,True
13710,"For the most part, refugees are only accessing entry-level jobs and they are competing with Indian nationals for them.",neutral,True
13711,The compensation from these jobs is so meager that most households need to have two or more people working full-time to cover rent and food.,neutral,True
13712,Children are dropping out of school or only attending partially in order to supplement the family income.,neutral,True
13713,There can be security risks in traveling to and from work especially the occasional and lucrative catering jobs at large night time parties.,neutral,True
13714,Sexual gender-based violence (SGBV) is prevalent in New Delhi and refugee women are victimized because they look different. .,neutral,True
13715,African refugees are the target of racist attacks.,neutral,True
13716,"In trying to avail themselves of services, refugees have learned they must navigate a slow paced bureaucracy.",neutral,True
13717,This is of particular concern in the face of the promises of the long stay visas.,neutral,True
13718,"With those visas, and the accorded rights to work and enroll in any academic institutions, refugees in Delhi could break the cycle of poverty and begin to establish a higher degree of income security.",neutral,True
13719,"Thus far, the Myanmarese refugees are obtaining the long stay visas easily and the Government of India has agreed to waive the associated fees.",neutral,True
13720,It is hoped that all other refugee communities will acquire these visas with the same facility.,neutral,True
13721,"With the work opportunities this visa affords in an up and coming city, it can open doors to a better socio- economic status.",neutral,True
13722,"Thus, it is understandable that refugees dream of resettlement to a more developed nation while they are confronting the paradoxes of modern India.",neutral,True
13723,"However, poverty is not grounds for resettlement.",neutral,True
13724,"The very limited spaces for resettlement to Australia, Canada, and the USA are reserved for refugees with protection needs that cannot be met in India and the limited spaces may be subject to resettlement countries preferences for particular nationalities.",neutral,True
13725,"For the existent refugees in New Delhi, there is not much connection with families for reunification claims in Australia, Canada and the USA.",neutral,True
13726,Most of the family reunification opportunities would be in Europe.,neutral,True
13727,"Thus, the UNHCR Office has a two-fold challenge in implementing the new policy for refugees in urban areas: 1) shifting the mindset of refugees from leaving India to staying and exploiting the opportunities offered, and, 2) advocating with the Government of India to make the lives of refugees tenable by actualizing their promises of widely recognized documents that would enable refugees to compete for more than slum-based opportunities.",neutral,True
13728,There are two decisive elements in the ability of the QIP to make positive change in the UK asylum system.,neutral,True
13729,One is the HO acceptance of the recommendations made by the QIP.,neutral,True
13730,The other is the effective implementation of the accepted recommendations.,neutral,True
13731,"While the QIP and the HO have stated their commitment to these components, ultimately, both the acceptance of the recommendations and their effective implementation reside with the HO as well as with UNHCR and the QIP.",neutral,True
13732,This underscores the importance of the QIP to continue to use its engagement with the HO and its access to staff to influence the implementation of the recommendations accepted by the HO.,neutral,True
13733,"When a UNHCR evaluation team visited a Somali refugee school and community centre in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, it found that all of the children and young people there had large pieces of paper pinned to their clothing, bearing a variety of different messages.",neutral,True

13739,"Thanks UNHCR, thanks UNHCR, thanks UNHCR.”",neutral,True
13740,"These brief slogans provide an appropriate starting point for this report, as they capture very graphically the main preoccupations of refugees who are living in urban areas of Malaysia: first, their inability to establish a secure and long-term future for themselves there; second, their eager quest to be admitted to another country where such opportunities would be available to them; and third, a firm belief that UNHCR is the only organization that can deliver such outcomes.",neutral,True
13741,"Somalis represent just a small proportion of the 100,000 refugees and asylum seekers living in Malaysia.",neutral,True
13742,The majority of this number originate from Myanmar and most have taken up residence in urban areas such as Kuala Lumpur and Penang.,neutral,True
13743,The situation of this substantial urban refugee population is in all respects a very difficult one.,neutral,True
13744,Malaysia does not have a legal framework governing refugee and asylum issues.,neutral,True
13745,"Persons of concern to UNHCR are technically considered to be irregular migrants, an even larger number of whom are also to be found in the country.",neutral,True
13746,"Protection gaps While they are generally not at risk of refoulement or deportation, refugees in Malaysia have been and continue to be at risk of arrest, detention, extortion and corporal punishment, although the frequency of such incidents has diminished in recent times.",neutral,True
13747,"Official restrictions prevent refugees from working in the formal sector of the economy, accessing healthcare on the same basis as nationals and attending Malaysian schools.",neutral,True
13748,"First, that policy is based on the principle of state responsibility.",neutral,True
13749,UNHCR will encourage all states to exercise this responsibility through its advocacy efforts.”,neutral,True
13750,"The local integration of refugees in Malaysia has been ruled out by the authorities, leaving refugees with only two real options: first, to wait for a resettlement place, while doing the best to make ends meet and to access the limited services provided by UNHCR, its local partners and their own community associations; or second, to move on from Malaysia in an irregular manner in the hope of being admitted to another country.",neutral,True
13751,"While the first of these options can take several years, the latter is extremely hazardous.",neutral,True
13752,The Malaysian government says the deaths of at least nine asylum seekers who drowned while trying to make it to Australia highlights the need for international cooperation in combating people smuggling.,neutral,True
13753,"The authorities have recovered the bodies of nine asylum seekers who drowned when the vessel, which was carrying Afghan and Iraqi men, capsized off the coast of southern Malaysia.",neutral,True
13754,Another 18 people were rescued but it remains unclear how many were aboard the vessel when it sank.,neutral,True
13755,"Sadly, further tragedies of this type cannot be ruled out.",neutral,True
13756,"For refugees who are living in Malaysia with very limited rights, who are prevented from remaining there on a legal basis, who are unable to return to their country of origin and who are confronted with the prospect of waiting several years for resettlement, then embarking on an overcrowded boat provided by unscrupulous human smugglers might be a risk worth taking.",neutral,True

13758,This statement is followed by summary versions of conclusions and recommendations linked to a specific conclusion.,neutral,True
13759,"Much will depend on the wishes of the government, possible protection gaps, the risk of national structures becoming overwhelmed from the start, and standards of fairness.",neutral,True
13760,The report recommends (6) that different options for continued processing are considered in a future strategy on transition.,neutral,True
13761,"Although funding may provide general leverage, its use as a tool for encouraging concrete improvements in RSD appears to be difficult and limited.",neutral,True
13762,"The preliminary report recommends (9) a closer look at the funding of national RSD structures, including the possibility of gradual phasing out schedules and ways to improve the accessibility and analysis of data in the context of results based management where funding continues.",neutral,True
13763,The report recommends (11) that UNHCR considers establishing benchmarks for protection staffing in situations of transition.,neutral,True
13764,They could serve as a useful complement to those formulated in 2010 for mandate RSD operations.,neutral,True
13765,"In addition, it is proposed (vi) to complement the findings with a more strategic inquiry into recent alternative, protection sensitive strategies which have helped to relieve pressures on individual RSD systems.",neutral,True
13766,"In order to put RSD transition policy and practice in a broader perspective, it is finally recommended (vii) to review the functioning and resourcing of mandate RSD in selected countries that are engaged in RSD transition.",neutral,True
13767,"In the proposed methodology, it is foreseen to pay attention to the views of asylum-seekers and refugees and to make good use of the expertise of experts from governments and NGO partners.",neutral,True
13768,"Somalis comprised the largest nationality group among asylum-seekers and refugees, at some 427,311.",neutral,True
13769,"Of the total number of refugees and asylum-seekers in 2014, 34,011 were asylum-seekers with pending claims, while 551,352 were refugees.",neutral,True
13770,"This number represents a slight decrease compared to the total number of refugees in Kenya at the beginning of 2014, which was 587,223; with 608,113 registered at the beginning of 2013.",neutral,True
13771,"The number of pending claims in Kakuma remains substantial, and will require concerted efforts to address it and ensure that decision-making can continue to keep pace with new claims.",neutral,True
13772,"In other locations, claim numbers of the current order in the other locations are likely to be manageable only if decision-making rates increase progressively beyond those seen in the first six months of the transition process, from July to December 2014, and planned measures are implemented to use simplified processing and other streamlined approaches to claims where appropriate, as well as improving efficiency in regular RSD.",neutral,True
13773,"The efficacy of decision-making will need to be monitored continuously, and the capacity of the system to manage its caseload may come into question if claims were to increase substantially, current and planned streamlining and efficiency measures cannot be implemented, or significant further backlogs were to build up.",neutral,True
13774,"In such cases, the possibility of further extension of the transition period, along with other measures to reinforce and expedite claim processing, would need further to be considered.",neutral,True
13775,A mechanism for on-going self-evaluation and quality assurance by DRA will also be needed in the future.,neutral,True
13776,"It will be important to clarify the role of UNHCR in supporting RSD after the transition process, as well as other aspects of its supervisory role under the Geneva Convention, along with that of civil society and other partners.",neutral,True
13777,"A potential role for UNHCR as an observer in the RSD process post-transition, at least for an initial period, should be considered by DRA and UNHCR.",neutral,True
13778,"This is particularly the case in camps, where both asylum-seekers and refugees (although in principle not those whose claims are rejected) are entitled to services and support.",neutral,True
13779,"Further efforts are needed in working with the Kenyan authorities to ensure that the RSD process can lead to accessible, viable durable solutions; in particular rights to work, greater free movement and potential prospects of citizenship in line with Kenyan law.",neutral,True
13780,"The Act establishes DRA and sets out a comprehensive institutional RSD framework, yet its implementation proves problematic in practice.",neutral,True

13782,"National security actions taken in 2012-13 and 2014 with regard to encampment.– including measures to enforce encampment rules in the 2006 Act, have highlighted the vulnerability of undocumented urban asylum seekers and refugees in Kenya.",neutral,True
13783,"Recently- adopted legislative changes under the Security Laws (Amendment) Act 2014, which would compel refugees to relocate in refugee camps and limit the number of refugees in the country to 150,000, would have worsened their situation considerably.",neutral,True
13784,"While these provisions were annulled by a High Court judgment in early 2015, they demonstrate the level of political sensitivity around the presence of urban refugees, and around refugee issues in Kenya more broadly.",neutral,True
13785,"In order to achieve an efficient and sustainable national RSD system, as part of an effective refugee protection framework in Kenya more broadly, it is imperative that the political will on the part of the authorities to take charge of registration and refugee status determination is translated into a commitment to allocate sufficient and sustained resources (both human and financial) in the coming years.",neutral,True
13786,"Other essential steps include establishment of the relevant institutions and civil service posts, and allocation of national resources to the process.",neutral,True
13787,"As Kenya continues to be exposed to the serious threat of terrorist acts, there is an evident interest for the country in enhancing oversight and control over who legally resides on Kenyan soil.",neutral,True
13788,"However, there is also a risk of excessive politicisation of refugee issues in Kenya, which could undermine the RSD process and pose risks for the institution of international protection more broadly, as political rhetoric aimed at forcing Somali refugees to return to their country has increased in volume and intensity.",neutral,True
13789,"The establishment and ongoing operation of a well-functioning RSD process needs to be clearly separated from political discussions and purely based on legal, technical and practical considerations.",neutral,True
13790,"Any political pressure disproportionately to curtail the rights of refugees, contrary to national and international law, should be resisted in favour of measured responses that respect the rule of law.",neutral,True
13791,"To be efficient in this context, UNHCR first needs to increase its education staff in-country, both in Ankara and in the field offices.",neutral,True
13792,"Secondly UNHCR should focus upon its agreed operating space within the negotiated division of labour: notably higher education, non-formal education and Turkish language training - aspects of education that are not being covered by other UN agencies.",neutral,True
13793,"This is an area where UNHCR should identify specific institutional and policy bottlenecks, pin down a few areas where a strategic investment can leverage greater returns, and then deliver on those specific activities at scale.",neutral,True

13808,The refugees are to be found primarily in remote and impoverished areas of Bangladesh which have not benefited from the modest economic growth that has recently taken place in some other parts of the country.,neutral,True
13809,Bangladesh also considers there has been inadequate international understanding and support with respect to the refugee impact on host communities.,neutral,True
13810,"The presence and general tolerance of such large numbers of Rohingya in Bangladesh derives in part from the social, ethnic, linguistic and religious characteristics that they share with the host community, particularly their common adherence to Islam.",neutral,True
13811,"Even so, political 2 and public opinion in Bangladesh is generally not well disposed towards the refugees.",neutral,True

13818,"More specifically, there may be scope to advocate on behalf of a framework which provides refugees with a formal status that would allow them access to employment opportunities and government services.",neutral,True
13819,"The fact that Bangladesh is itself highly dependent on income from migrant labour, and has recently signed the International Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers, is relevant in this respect.",neutral,True
13820,"Third, it should be recalled that the Rohingya refugee situation is now a truly regional one, affecting not only Bangladesh but also countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia as well as India and the Middle East.",neutral,True
13821,"This argues very strongly in favour of an Asia-Pacific approach to the issue, involving not only those states that are hosting refugees, but also countries such as China and India that have considerable influence throughout the region, as well as resettlement countries outside the region.",neutral,True
13822,"The organization should immediately capitalize on this renewed interest, reminding the international community that the Rohingya are trapped not only in a protracted refugee situation, but also in a protracted situation of statelessness.",neutral,True
13823,The former problem will not be resolved without a resolution of the latter.,neutral,True

13960,"Most importantly, there should be a shared appreciation of the need for a broad, comprehensive, but operationally-oriented concept of protection by the three key potential Cluster Leads, so as to ensure coherence of approach should any of the three agencies be called upon to assume the Cluster Lead role in the Field.",neutral,True
13961,The first relates to an intervention by UNHCR limited to the provision of Non-Food Items (NFIs).,neutral,True
13962,Here the concrete case of the Philippines Hurricanes was studied (2009).,neutral,True
13963,This choice of the Philippines was also dictated by the fact that UNHCR saw this as a prototype of future such interventions in natural disasters.,neutral,True
13964,"The fourth and fifth scenarios looked at the concrete interventions in Myanmar (2008) and Haiti (2010) as examples of a more general involvement in natural disasters, either with responsibility for particular Clusters (Myanmar) or without having a lead role in relation to any sector (Haiti).",neutral,True
13965,"This latter operation was chosen as the UN response has been somewhat criticized and, on the basis of the UN performance to date in the Protection Cluster, some have called for UNHCR to be the lead agency in any future natural disaster involving significant displacement.",neutral,True

13980,It is in this perspective that UNHCR should seek to become part of the UNDAC.,neutral,True
13981,"It should also seek to ensure that through the IASC, issues related to profiling of IDPs become the recognized responsibility of Protection Cluster Working Group (PCWG).",neutral,True
13982,It is suggested that any further involvement in this new type of IDP operations by UNHCR should take place in an incremental manner with an involvement in 2010 limited initially to a specified number of natural disasters.,neutral,True

13984,"The High Commissioner, in the light of the likely significant demands flowing from any UNHCR involvement in natural disasters, may need to review the staffing implications of such involvement; as a minimum, two parts of UNHCR Headquarters will require strengthening, namely the Emergency Preparedness and Response Section (EPRS), and the second pillar in the revised DIP structure which will be dealing with the Protection Cluster.",neutral,True
