through the steps required putting those recommendations into effect and the capacities  
that the programme (and/or the ILO) would have needed to do so. The impact of this  
programme at this stage at national level therefore remains potential rather than actual.  
Furthermore, there seems to have been less than optimal communication and exchange

been collected, analysed, used and made accessible to interested parties, iii) the policy

published work that was exploratory and innovative, but that did not represent ILO

UNHCR,UNHCR_13_2013_Eval,"A return to New Delhi was especially interesting since the author of the new policy had  
been on the earlier evaluation team and noted that the earlier mission seeded many elements  
of the new policy. Two-thirds of the 2000 evaluation made explicit suggestions for amending  
the 1997 policy and laid considerable groundwork for the 2009 policy. Thus, a return to  
New Delhi in January 2013 to evaluate the viability of the new, more progressive policy  
toward urban refugees and the applicability of the twelve protection strategies was perhaps  
an overdue analysis.  
Both the city and the refugee population have expanded in the intervening years. Over this  
timespan, the refugees and asylum seekers diversified from an almost all Afghan  
demographic to now include people from Myanmar, Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Eritrea,  
Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and other African, Middle Eastern and Eastern  
European countries. Now, New Delhi is a bustling national capital with a beautiful new  
airport, elevated highways, and metro lines to keep people moving around its ballooning  
spaces. 
The city’s teeming economy has a lot to offer refugees especially in comparison to the  
situations reviewed in other recent evaluations of urban refugees. Yet, India’s recent and  
much touted burgeoning economy sits in paradox to its other source of notoriety: poverty.  
In response to the juxtaposition of an economic boom and a persistently high poverty rate,  
India has spent billions of dollars on poverty alleviation schemes in the past decade. 
Even though many Indians continue to be mired in poverty, the government provides access  
to health, education and potentially to selected poverty alleviation schemes to refugees. This  
is all the more significant since India is neither a signatory to the 1951 Convention nor does  
it have a national refugee law.

Despite India’s ad hoc approach to their legal status, there is no tradition of refoulement,  
discrimination or detention of refugees. Moreover, India has recently agreed to allow  
mandate refugees to apply for long-term visas that would provide them with the legal right  
to work and access to all academic institutions. Taking all this into consideration, New Delhi  
appears to be a city with distinct advantages for today’s refugees",tommilson,26.06.2019 10:37:00,2309,3.620314,neutral
UNHCR,UNHCR_13_2013_Eval,"Even so, many of the refugees in New Delhi would like to move on to a third country and  
recently the UNHCR Office has spent considerable resources in discouraging unrealistic  
aspirations for resettlement. It is gradually becoming clear to these refugees that India may  
not be a way-station but a destination. And at this destination, refugees need to navigate

Bangladesh is currently host to some 29,000 recognized refugees who are accommodated in  
camps and an estimated 36,000 unrecognized refugees who have congregated in makeshift  
sites to which UNHCR and other international and national humanitarian actors have  
limited access. In addition, there are thought to be at least 200,000 undocumented Rohingya  
living in host communities and who are also considered to be of concern to UNHCR.  
Bangladesh is not well placed to cope with this protracted refugee situation. The country is  
confronted with extreme poverty and high rates of population growth, and is increasingly  
affected by natural disasters and climate change. The refugees are to be found primarily in  
remote and impoverished areas of Bangladesh which have not benefited from the modest  
economic growth that has recently taken place in some other parts of the country.  
From the government’s perspective, there has been a lack of concerted international action  
to address the circumstances that forced the Rohingya to leave Myanmar and which now  
obstruct their repatriation. Bangladesh also considers there has been inadequate  
international understanding and support with respect to the refugee impact on host  
communities.  
The presence and general tolerance of such large numbers of Rohingya in Bangladesh  
derives in part from the social, ethnic, linguistic and religious characteristics that they share  
with the host community, particularly their common adherence to Islam. Even so, political

the refugees are poorly served.  
Refugee self-reliance initiatives have not attained their intended goals. Without freedom of  
movement and the ability to pursue educational and livelihoods opportunities outside the  
camps, it has proved very difficult for the Rohingya to generate additional income. As a  
result, refugees are increasingly driven to adopt negative coping mechanisms. The absence  
of any durable solution adds to the frustration of the refugees and the demoralization of the

that approximately a third of the population originated from other parts of Mozambique but

The village leaders confirmed that there was land available because of the high death toll and  
due to out migration. But, the newcomers were from different places and different tribes and  
had to be vetted before being accepted as community members. This process was still ongoing,

response to the population displacement occurring within Cote d’Ivoire and across the

This was a slow-onset emergency, characterised in the early stages by largely pre- 
emptive displacement which began to increase in pace by the third week of December 
after a series of clashes in north-western Côte d’Ivoire. The RTE captures the situation as  
it was at the end of February 2011, a moment when the overall humanitarian situation  
was deteriorating, as the political and security crisis deepened. Some 40,000 refugees  
had already crossed the border into Liberia, and some 38,500 were believed to be  
internally displaced in western Côte d’Ivoire. 
In Liberia, the refugees were being hosted in more than 70 villages along the border, and  
the first camp had just opened. In Côte d’Ivoire, IDPs had sought refuge with host  
families and in schools and other temporary sites in the west of the country. Owing in  
part to the public perception that the UN mission (ONUCI) was politically aligned with  
President-elect Alassane Ouattara, UN staff had been withdrawn from western Côte

protection and solutions framework which should shape the collective response, and

contingency planning phase. It also needs to be facilitated by a clearer understanding  
with key partner agencies at a global level as to how inter-agency coordination of  
refugee emergencies should be managed, and the reinforcement of technical services in  
fundraising and information management.  
Second, contingency planning and preparedness measures have both an inter-agency

This literature review aims to synthesise what is currently known about labour market  
integration of resettled refugees. One aspect, widely acknowledged in the literature, is that a  
‘refugee gap’ appears when comparing resettled refugees to other immigrants in terms of labour  
market integration. Analyses in multiple countries have shown that resettled refugees perform  
worse in measures of labour market integration compared to other immigrants and individuals  
in the short-term, even when controlling for differences in demographics such as age, education  
level, and level of host country language acquisition. This is alarming given the centrality of  
employment in the metrics of governments and refugees themselves. Yet, in the longer term,  
resettled refugee groups have been shown to be closing this gap, and some promising practices  
for further narrowing the gap can be identified. This review examines, given the available  
evidence, the extent to which resettled refugees have been able to integrate into the labour  
market of the host country, the barriers and resilience factors to labour market integration, and  
promising practices for improving labour market integration",tommilson,07.09.2019 20:50:00,1212,0.748855,neutral

UNHCR,UNHCR_41_2010_Eval,"The right to participate in political decision-making processes is recognized by the  
international community as a fundamental human right: “everyone has the right to  
take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen  
representatives... the will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of  
government.” This paper considers the importance of refugee participation in  
country of origin political processes, and the extent to which UNHCR should seek to  
facilitate or promote refugee engagement in such activities.  
The framing of contemporary international political order rests upon the notion that  
the liberal-democratic nation-state, personified by a government chosen by and  
accountable to its citizens, is a just and inclusive order that can protect fundamental  
rights. Yet refugee flight, by definition, indicates the failure of this model.  
Refugees, whether persecuted as a result of race, religion, nationality, membership of  
a particular social group or political opinion, are excluded (sometimes in a very  
deliberate manner) from the structures of political power in their country of origin.  
The search for solutions to refugee situations is thus in part a struggle of the  
politically excluded for political inclusion.  
Researchers have frequently focused on the political identity of the refugee.  
However, previous studies have often tended to focus on the activities of so-called  
“refugee warriors“, the “spoilers” of regional peace-building initiatives who turn to  
violence in order to assert their demands for political inclusion.  
This paper does not look at that much discussed issue, but focuses instead on the  
development of UNHCR‟s role in facilitating or promoting the engagement of  
refugees in non-violent and civic country of origin political processes, including out- 
of-country voting.  
This paper consists of five parts. In the first section, the nature and dynamics of  
political participation are considered. The importance of political activity in general  
to democratic ideals of government is examined, as is the specific importance of  
political participation – both symbolic and substantive – to displaced populations.  
The second part of the paper looks briefly at UNHCR‟s past and present engagement  
with refugee politics. In the following section, the political and logistical challenges  
of refugee participation in country of origin elections are considered. The fourth  
section looks at other forms of peaceful political engagement, including emerging  
transnational political activities. These analyzes draw on material from a number of  
case studies, including but not limited to Eritrea (1993), Bosnia (1996), Liberia (1997  
and 2002) Kosovo (1999), East Timor (1999), Afghanistan (2004, 2009), Iraqi (2005,
