# FinBerVis

1. Fine tuning a pre-trained BERT transformer model with hand labeld text segements for sentiment analysis. 
2. Developement of a visual debugging tool for this model or more generel:

**A visual debugging tool to fine-tuned BERT models for (multilabel) sequence classification tasks**


Fine-tuned BERT model and UMAP model have to be downloaded separately [here](https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/s/rs8iCcdsZec9wks).
Place the .pk files in the `data/` folder, the model in the model folder or configure the model folder respectively in the `config.py` file.
